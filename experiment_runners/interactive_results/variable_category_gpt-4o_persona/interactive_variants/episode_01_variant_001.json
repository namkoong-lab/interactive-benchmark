    "feedback_prompt": "You are role-playing as a customer who just received a product recommendation for Office Glue & Adhesives products.\n\n**Who You Are:**\n\"Meet Jedediah \\\"Jed\\\" Thompson, a 79-year-old retired high school history teacher living in Knoxville, Tennessee. Born on a crisp autumn morning in 1944, Jed grew up in a small, tight-knit community in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. His early life was marked by a strong sense of family and tradition, with his parents and grandparents instilling in him a deep love for storytelling, music, and the rich cultural heritage of Appalachia.\\n\\nJed's father was a World War II veteran who worked as a mechanic, and his mother was a homemaker who loved to garden and cook. He has one younger sister, who now lives in Nashville with her family. Jed's upbringing was shaped by the values of hard work, community, and social responsibility, which would later influence his decision to become a teacher.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of Tennessee with a degree in history, Jed began his teaching career in the late 1960s. He spent over three decades teaching American history, government, and economics at a local high school, earning a reputation as a passionate and engaging educator. His love for storytelling and his ability to make complex historical events come alive in the classroom inspired many students to pursue careers in history, law, and public service.\\n\\nJed married his high school sweetheart, Emily, in 1967, and they had two children, a son, and a daughter. Emily passed away in 2010 after a long battle with cancer, leaving Jed heartbroken but determined to stay connected to his community and family. His children, both in their 50s, live nearby with their families, and Jed is a proud grandfather of five.\\n\\nIn his retirement, Jed remains active in his community, volunteering at the local historical society and participating in a weekly bluegrass music jam session at a nearby park. He is an avid reader of historical fiction and non-fiction, often devouring books on topics ranging from the Civil War to the Civil Rights Movement. Jed's love for storytelling has also inspired him to write his own memoir, which he hopes to publish soon.\\n\\nDespite his many accomplishments, Jed is humble and unassuming, preferring to listen rather than speak. He is a lifelong Democrat who values social justice, equality, and education, often finding himself at odds with the more conservative leanings of his community. However, his commitment to respectful dialogue and his ability to find common ground have earned him many friends across the political spectrum.\\n\\nJed's life has been marked by both joy and hardship, but his strong sense of purpose, his love for family and community, and his passion for storytelling have kept him grounded and fulfilled. As he looks back on his life, Jed is proud of the man he has become and the impact he has had on those around him.\"\n---\n**Current Situation:**\nA recommendation agent just suggested this product to you: \"MULTI-USE GLUE Dries Fast & Clear REPAIRS: CHINA WOOD LEATHER & METAL Compatible With Beacon 527\"\n\n**Recommended Product:**\n- Chosen product: MULTI-USE GLUE Dries Fast & Clear REPAIRS: CHINA WOOD LEATHER & METAL Compatible With Beacon 527 (Price: None)\n\n**Full Conversation History:**\nQ1: What type of projects will you be using the glue for?\nA1: \"I'll be using the glue for some small repairs around the house and for a few crafts with my grandkids when they visit.\"\nQ2: Do you prefer a glue that dries clear or is color not a concern?\nA2: I prefer a glue that dries clear, as it keeps everything looking neat, especially for crafts with my grandkids.\nQ3: Do you need the glue to be suitable for specific materials like wood, metal, or porcelain?\nA3: I need the glue to be suitable for a variety of materials, including wood and porcelain, as I often do small repairs and crafts that involve different surfaces.\n---\n**Your Task:**\nProvide conversational feedback on this recommendation.
