        "What is your primary purpose for purchasing an alarm clock - waking up on time for work or daily routines, helping with sleep schedules, or for a specific person like a child or elderly family member?",
        "What specific sleep schedule challenges are you trying to address - difficulty falling asleep at a consistent time, trouble waking up naturally, or maintaining regular sleep and wake times throughout the week?",
        "What specific features would be most helpful for an alarm clock designed to help you fall asleep at a consistent time - soothing sounds or white noise to help you relax, gradual dimming lights that simulate sunset, or scheduled reminders to start your bedtime routine?",
        "What is your budget range for purchasing an alarm clock with gradual dimming light features?",
        "Do you prefer alarm clocks with physical buttons and controls that you can operate by touch in the dark, or digital touchscreen interfaces with app connectivity for more advanced customization options?",
        "What time do you typically want to start winding down for sleep, and how long would you prefer the gradual dimming process to take - a quick 15-30 minute sunset simulation, a moderate 45-60 minute gradual fade, or a longer 90+ minute slow transition to darkness?",
        "What additional features would be most valuable to you in an alarm clock with sunset simulation - built-in nature sounds or white noise for relaxation, a sunrise simulation feature for gentle morning wake-up, or smart home integration capabilities?",
        "What is the maximum display brightness level you would prefer for your alarm clock - a very dim display that's barely visible in complete darkness, a moderate brightness that's easy to read but not distracting, or a bright display that's clearly visible from across the room?",
        "What bedroom environment factors are most important for your sleep routine - complete darkness with blackout capabilities, ambient room temperature control, or minimal noise and sound isolation?",

        "What size wet bag would work best for your needs when out and about - a small compact bag that fits easily in a purse or diaper bag for 1-2 diapers, a medium-sized bag that can hold 3-5 diapers for longer outings, or a large bag that can accommodate a full day's worth of soiled diapers?",
        "What specific features are most important to you in a cloth diaper wet bag - waterproof lining to prevent leaks, easy-to-clean material that can be wiped down or machine washed, secure closure like zippers or snaps, or odor-blocking properties to contain smells?",
        "What type of closure mechanism do you prefer for your wet bag - a zipper closure for complete sealing, snap closure for quick one-handed access, or drawstring closure for easy opening and closing?",
