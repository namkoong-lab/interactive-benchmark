        "What is your primary intended use for computer speakers - enhancing audio quality for music listening, improving sound for gaming and entertainment, providing clear audio for video calls and meetings, or general desktop computer audio enhancement?",
        "What's your budget range for computer speakers?",
        "What type of music do you primarily listen to - classical and acoustic genres that benefit from clear midrange and detailed sound reproduction, bass-heavy genres like hip-hop and electronic that require strong low-end response, rock and pop music that needs balanced full-range sound, or a mix of different musical styles?",
        "Do you prefer computer speakers with a 2.0 stereo setup for a clean desktop appearance, a 2.1 system with a separate subwoofer for enhanced bass response, or a larger multi-driver system for maximum sound quality and room-filling audio?",
        "What is your preferred desktop setup and space constraints - do you have ample desk space for larger speakers and a subwoofer, limited desk space requiring compact speakers, or do you prefer placing the subwoofer on the floor under your desk?",
        "What connectivity features are most important to you for your computer speakers - wired connections only for reliable audio quality, Bluetooth wireless capability for connecting multiple devices, or a combination of both wired and wireless options for maximum flexibility?",
        "What audio quality characteristics are most important to you when listening to rock and pop music - crisp, clear vocals and midrange frequencies, punchy bass that enhances rhythm sections, balanced sound across all frequencies, or dynamic range that handles both quiet and loud passages well?",
        "Do you have any brand preferences for computer speakers based on past experience with audio equipment, or are you open to any manufacturer that delivers the balanced sound quality and connectivity features you're looking for?",
        "What room size will you primarily be using these computer speakers in - a small home office or bedroom, a medium-sized living room or den, or a large open space that requires speakers to fill a bigger area with sound?",
        "What specific features or capabilities are most important to you in computer speakers for your medium-sized living room setup - powerful amplification to fill the room with sound, precise sound imaging for optimal listening position, multiple input options for connecting various devices, or built-in controls and remote functionality for convenient operation?"
