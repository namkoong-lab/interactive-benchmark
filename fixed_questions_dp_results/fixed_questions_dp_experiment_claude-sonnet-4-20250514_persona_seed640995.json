        "What type of cooking do you primarily do - grilling and barbecuing outdoors, slow cooking and meal prep, international cuisine like Asian or Caribbean dishes, or general everyday cooking?",
        "What's your budget range for seasoning mixes?",
        "Are you looking for seasoning mixes that are organic, made with natural ingredients, or do you have any specific dietary restrictions like gluten-free, low-sodium, or vegan requirements?",
        "Which specific types of international cuisine do you cook most often - Asian dishes like stir-fries and curries, Caribbean dishes like jerk chicken and rice dishes, Mediterranean cuisine, or Latin American dishes?",
        "Given that all available seasoning mixes are priced under $0.05 which is significantly below your $5-10 budget and have no product descriptions, would you prefer to purchase from a different retailer that offers detailed Mediterranean seasoning blends made with organic ingredients in your budget range, or would you be interested in selecting from these minimal-cost items as a temporary solution while you search for higher-quality organic options elsewhere?",
        "Since you prefer to shop elsewhere for quality organic Mediterranean seasonings, are you interested in learning about specific herb and spice combinations to look for (like oregano, thyme, and rosemary blends), or would you prefer recommendations for reputable organic spice retailers that specialize in Mediterranean cuisine?",
        "Would you like me to provide you with a list of specific reputable online retailers that specialize in organic Mediterranean spices and seasonings, or would you prefer recommendations for local specialty stores and farmers markets where you can find these products?",
        "What's your location or region so I can recommend the best local specialty stores and farmers markets in your area that carry organic Mediterranean spices?",
        "For your Hartford area search, would you prefer specialty stores that focus specifically on Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, or would you be interested in broader gourmet food stores and co-ops that carry organic spice sections alongside other sustainable products?",
        "Since you're interested in sustainable products and prefer local shopping, would you like me to provide you with specific names and locations of Hartford-area stores like Whole Foods Market, Crown Market, or local co-ops where you can find organic Mediterranean spice blends, or would you prefer general guidance on what to look for when visiting these types of stores?"
