        "What specific ear care need are you looking to address - noise reduction for sleeping or concentration, ear cleaning and wax removal, hearing protection for loud environments, or water protection for swimming?",
        "What's your budget range for hearing protection products?",
        "What type of loud environments do you need protection from most often - concerts and music venues, construction or industrial work sites, shooting ranges or hunting, or general urban noise like traffic and machinery?",
        "Do you prefer earplugs that you insert into your ear canal for maximum noise reduction, or over-ear/on-ear options that sit outside your ears for comfort during extended wear?",
        "Since all available products are priced under $0.08 which is far below your $30-100 budget for over-ear hearing protection, would you prefer to look for higher-quality products from a different retailer that specializes in professional hearing protection, or would you be willing to consider these very low-cost options as a temporary solution?",
        "Given that the available products are extremely low-priced and may not meet professional hearing protection standards, would you be willing to consider alternative ear care solutions like basic foam earplugs or simple ear cleaning products instead of over-ear hearing protection?",
        "Since you prefer professional-grade hearing protection from a specialized retailer, would you be willing to consider any of these very low-cost ear care products for a completely different purpose, such as basic ear cleaning or maintenance, or would you prefer to end this session and shop elsewhere for your hearing protection needs?",
        "Based on your previous shopping episodes where you mentioned interests in gardening, environmental conservation, and native Minnesota plants, are you actually looking for ear care products, or would you prefer to explore products related to your gardening and environmental interests instead?",
        "What specific aspects of gardening are you most interested in - indoor houseplants and container gardening, outdoor vegetable and herb growing, native plant landscaping and wildlife habitat creation, or sustainable gardening practices and composting?",
