        "What's your budget range for this wind chime purchase?",
        "What size wind chime would work best for your relaxation space - a small delicate chime for intimate indoor or close outdoor spaces, a medium-sized chime for patios or garden areas, or a large chime that can be heard from a distance for expansive outdoor settings?",
        "What material or sound quality do you prefer for your wind chime - deep, resonant tones from metal tubes, gentle melodic sounds from bamboo, or soft tinkling sounds from smaller metal pieces?",
        "What type of installation location do you have in mind for your wind chime - a covered patio or porch area that's protected from direct weather, an open garden or yard space with full sun and wind exposure, or a partially sheltered area like under a pergola or tree canopy?",

        "What length of wind chime tubes would you prefer for achieving those deep, bass-like tones - longer tubes (around 24-30 inches) that produce the deepest, most resonant sounds, or medium-length tubes (around 18-24 inches) that still provide deep tones but are more proportionate for a covered patio setting?",
        "What's the maximum weight capacity or mounting requirements you need to consider for your covered patio installation - do you have a sturdy overhead beam or hook that can support a heavier, longer wind chime, or do you need something lighter that works with standard patio mounting options?"

        "What specific purpose or use do you have in mind for plastic bags - are you looking for food storage and kitchen organization, packaging items for shipping or selling, organizing small household items like jewelry or crafts, or protecting and storing larger items like clothing or documents?",
        "What size plastic bags do you need for organizing your craft items - small bags for tiny items like beads or buttons, medium bags for supplies like ribbons or fabric scraps, large bags for bigger materials like yarn skeins or paper, or a variety pack with different sizes?",
        "What types of craft items do you most frequently organize - small items like beads, buttons, or findings that need tiny compartments, medium items like ribbons, threads, or small tools, or larger supplies like fabric pieces, paper, or bulkier materials?",
        "What's your budget range for plastic bags for organizing your craft supplies?",
        "What features are most important to you in plastic bags for organizing fabric pieces - clear visibility so you can easily see contents, strong sealing mechanisms to keep items secure, tear-resistant material for durability when handling heavier fabrics, or easy-to-label surfaces for organization?",
        "How do you typically store your fabric pieces currently - do you fold them and stack them in drawers or bins, roll them up to prevent creasing, hang them to keep them wrinkle-free, or lay them flat in storage boxes?",
        "Do you prefer plastic bags with ziplock-style closures that can be opened and closed repeatedly for easy access to your fabric pieces, or heat-sealable bags that provide more permanent storage once sealed?",
        "How many fabric pieces do you typically need to organize at one time - just a few special pieces for current projects, a moderate collection of 20-50 pieces, or a large fabric stash with over 100 pieces that needs systematic organization?",
        "Do you need the plastic bags to have any special features for fabric storage like moisture protection to prevent mildew, anti-static properties to reduce lint attraction, or reinforced seams to handle the weight of multiple fabric pieces?",
        "What quantity of plastic bags do you need for your fabric organization project - a small starter pack of 10-20 bags to try out the system, a medium pack of 50-100 bags to organize your current collection, or a large bulk pack of 200+ bags for long-term organization and future fabric purchases?"
