        "What type of cleaning task are you looking to accomplish - cleaning windows and glass surfaces, cleaning floors and large surfaces, or cleaning shower doors and bathroom surfaces?",
        "What's your budget range for household squeegees?",
        "Do you have any specific features you're looking for in a squeegee, such as rubber blade quality, handle length, or ease of storage?",
        "Based on your previous feedback showing interest in maritime activities and sailing, are you actually looking for boat/marine squeegees for cleaning yacht or sailboat windows and surfaces, or do you need household squeegees for cleaning windows in your home?",
        "What's your budget range for marine/boat squeegees for your sailboat?",
        "What size squeegee blade would work best for your sailboat - a smaller handheld size (6-8 inches) for detailed work on smaller windows and tight spaces, or a larger size (10-12 inches) for efficiently cleaning bigger deck areas and cabin windows?",
        "Since all available household squeegees are priced under $0.10 which is far below your $15-30 marine squeegee budget, and based on your previous feedback showing interest in sailing gear like sailing jackets, are you actually looking for other marine/sailing equipment or accessories rather than squeegees?",
        "What type of marine/sailing equipment or accessories are you most interested in - safety gear like life jackets and harnesses, navigation equipment like compasses and charts, sailing hardware like winches and cleats, or boat maintenance supplies like cleaners and polishes?",
        "Since you're interested in navigation equipment like compasses and charts, what's your budget range for marine navigation equipment for your sailboat?",
        "Since none of these household squeegee products match your $500-1000 budget for marine navigation equipment, would you prefer I recommend one of the free squeegee options as a placeholder while you find proper navigation equipment elsewhere, or are you actually looking for books about maritime navigation and seamanship that you could read and enjoy?"
