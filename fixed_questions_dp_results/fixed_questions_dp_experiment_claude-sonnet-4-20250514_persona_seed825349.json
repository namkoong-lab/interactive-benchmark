        "What type of alcoholic beverage are you most interested in - wine for dining or special occasions, beer for casual drinking, spirits like whiskey or vodka for cocktails, or are you looking for non-alcoholic alternatives like mocktails or specialty sodas?",
        "What's your budget range for wine purchases - are you looking for everyday wines under $20, mid-range wines between $20-50 for regular dining, premium wines between $50-100 for special occasions, or luxury wines over $100 for very special celebrations?",
        "What type of wine do you prefer for your regular dining - red wines like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot, white wines like Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc, ros\u00e9 wines, or do you enjoy a variety of different wine types depending on the meal?",
        "What food types do you most commonly pair with your Merlot - red meats like steak and lamb, Italian dishes like pasta with tomato sauce, grilled vegetables and mushroom dishes, or a variety of different cuisines depending on the occasion?",
        "What specific characteristics do you look for in a Merlot wine - do you prefer lighter, fruit-forward styles with berry flavors, medium-bodied wines with balanced tannins and earthiness, or fuller-bodied Merlots with rich, complex flavors and oak aging?",
        "What region or wine-producing area do you prefer for your Merlot - Washington State for fruit-forward styles, California regions like Napa or Sonoma for rich complexity, French Merlots from Bordeaux for traditional earthiness, or are you open to exploring different regions based on quality and value?",
        "What specific Bordeaux appellations or sub-regions do you prefer for your Merlot - Right Bank regions like Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol known for Merlot-dominant blends, Left Bank regions like M\u00e9doc where Merlot plays a supporting role to Cabernet Sauvignon, or are you open to exploring different Bordeaux regions based on the specific wine's quality and characteristics?",
        "What vintage years do you prefer for your Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol wines - recent vintages from the last 5 years for immediate drinking, mature vintages from 10-15 years ago that are ready to drink now, or older vintage wines from 20+ years ago for special occasions and cellaring?",
        "What is your preferred purchasing method for acquiring mature Bordeaux wines - buying directly from wine shops or retailers for immediate availability, purchasing from wine auctions or estate sales for rare vintages, ordering from specialized wine importers who focus on French wines, or buying from online wine merchants with detailed vintage information and reviews?",
        "What is your maximum budget for a single bottle of mature Saint-\u00c9milion or Pomerol wine from a specialized French wine importer - are you looking to spend $30-50 for quality estate wines, $50-80 for premium ch\u00e2teau bottlings, $80-120 for prestigious producers, or are you willing to invest $120+ for exceptional vintage bottles from renowned estates?"
