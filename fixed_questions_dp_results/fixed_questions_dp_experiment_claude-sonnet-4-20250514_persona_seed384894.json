        "What size hard drives do you primarily need to house in external enclosures - 2.5-inch drives like laptop drives and SSDs, 3.5-inch desktop drives, or do you need an enclosure that can accommodate both sizes?",
        "What connectivity interface do you need for your 3.5-inch external drive enclosure - USB 3.0 for standard fast data transfer, USB-C for modern device compatibility, eSATA for maximum performance, or Thunderbolt for professional-grade speed requirements?",
        "What additional features are most important to you in a USB-C external drive enclosure - built-in cooling fans or heat dissipation for continuous operation, tool-free installation for easy drive swapping, LED status indicators for power and activity monitoring, or multiple drive support for RAID configurations?",
        "What's your primary use case for this USB-C external drive enclosure - backing up large media files that require sustained high-speed transfers, storing and accessing frequently used work documents and applications, creating a portable storage solution for travel between different computers, or setting up a semi-permanent desktop storage expansion?",
        "What operating system compatibility is most important for your USB-C external drive enclosure - Windows with NTFS formatting for maximum compatibility, macOS with HFS+ or APFS for seamless Mac integration, cross-platform compatibility that works with both Windows and Mac, or Linux support for specialized workflows?",
        "What's your preferred physical design for the USB-C external drive enclosure - a compact horizontal desktop unit that sits flat and takes up minimal space, a vertical tower design that has a smaller footprint but stands upright, or a portable design with a carrying handle or compact form factor for occasional transport between locations?",
        "What's your preferred power delivery method for the USB-C external drive enclosure - USB-C bus power that draws power directly from your computer for maximum portability, external AC adapter power that provides consistent performance for sustained high-speed transfers, or dual power options that can work with either bus power or external power depending on your usage needs?",
        "What's your maximum acceptable noise level for the USB-C external drive enclosure during sustained high-speed transfers - completely silent operation for quiet work environments, minimal fan noise that's barely audible during normal use, moderate cooling fan noise that's acceptable for performance benefits, or you don't mind audible cooling if it ensures optimal performance for large media file backups?"
