      "MSM for dogs that helps support healthy joint function. Your dogss joints work hard, and natural fluids help keep cartilage healthy by lubricating the joints. But normal wear and tear, age, injury or degenerative diseases can take its toll. You can help your dog maintain good joint health and mobility by adding InflamAway Plus hip and joint formula to his daily care program. Formulated without artificial fillers, InflamAway Plus contains 500 mg. Glucosamine HCl, 100 mg. Chondroitin Sulfate, MSM, Yucca and Vitamin C, making it an extremely powerful joint support formula.

Glucosamine comes in two forms (hydrochloride and sulfate), we use Glucosamine Hydrochloride (HCl) in InflamAway Plus. While both forms have been shown to be effective, we believe the more concentrated HCl form is superior as it delivers on average 25 s 30 more Glucosamine for a given weight than the sulfate version. InflamAway Plus provides your dog with a highly pure concentrated source of Glucosamine that can be readily absorbed into his system.dog playing frisbee catch InflamAway Plus effectively combines the Glucosamine with high grade Chondroitin Sulfate, which studies suggest inhibits enzymes that destroy cartilage and assists in the production of synovial fluid and collagen.

And vital to joint, tendon and ligament health, MSM is a naturally occurring sulfur compound that helps fight inflammation and supports the formation of strong connective joint tissue.
