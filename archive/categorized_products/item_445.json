      "Minneapolis Motion City Soundtrack took the indie screen by storm with their 2003 debut I'm AM THE MOVIE. This follow-up represents a major step forward, a breakthrough release in the tradition of Jimmy Eat World's BLEED AMERICAN or AFI's SING THE SORROW, a masterpiece of pop harmonies and sing along choruses layered on top of their trademark angular guitars loopy synths and stop/start dynamics."
