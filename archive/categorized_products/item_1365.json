      "The AquaticHI felt filter sock was designed with an aquarium hobbyist in mind. The 200 micron catches and traps waste such as uneaten food, decaying plants, livestock, and organic matter that breaks down and produces unwanted ammonia in the tank. Smaller micron filters will also provide the same benefits but will clog and require cleaning/replacing more often.",
