      "Alfred Lion and Max Margulis established the BLUE NOTE label in 1939, with photographer Francis Wolff becoming involved shortly afterwards. The caliber of the musicians that recorded for Blue Note coupled with its stylized cover designs has made it one of the most legendary jazz labels of all time. From the dozens of classic albums produced by the Blue Note label, our collection presents some of the most outstanding titles. They have been reissued with all of their original artwork on 180-gram virgin vinyl limited edition pressings, constituting an absolute treasure both for the ears and for the eyes."
