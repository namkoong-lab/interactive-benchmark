      "Gardenera FINE Grade Organic Perlite is naturally occurring gray siliceous rock that expands up to 20 times its original volume when heated to 1600 degree F. This produces a growing media that has a neutral pH and adds porosity to soil and soilless mixes. Our Perlite is clean, sterile, Non-Flammable, odorless, nontoxic and does not decay nor shrink. It will not alter the composition of your carnivorous plant soil. It also resists compaction, helping to keep soil light and making it ideal for indoor gardening. The porosity of Perlite is one of the most beneficial aspects of this natural soil additive. When growing plants in containers the idea is to imitate natural soil and ground conditions where the plant grows best. Typical soil additives will compact and suppress air flow within containers, opposite of what naturally occurs underground. Adding Perlite to your potting mix will alleviate stress on growing roots and enhance the soils ability to drain.
