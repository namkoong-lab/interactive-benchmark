      "This album finds Janis Ian's voice in its purest, most vital form ever. The tracks were recorded as live as possible without sounding retro. This 1992 all-analogue recording, praised as much for the artist's too infrequently heard talents as for its recorded dynamics, is now available on an equally meticulous transfer to gold-plated CD, returned to the catalog after a 10 year absence. Matched with Ian's very personal songs, delivered in a voice that draws you in close in confidence, Breaking Silence is one of the very few recordings of recent years that by reproducing a pure analogue sound, has attained true audiophile status. This CD has been remastered using the 20+16 Ultra Matrix Processing. This mastering technique enables more information to be extracted from the analog tapes to be encoded and transferred to the CD master. This combination creates the truest and most accurate CD master from the original analog recording, and is the finest analog-to-digital transfer process currently available."
