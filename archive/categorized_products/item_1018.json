      "Relumins Vitamin C Maximum Skin Brightening is like no other supplement because it has been specially developed to enhance the effectiveness of skin brightening by providing targeted nutritional support. This formula features a skin-conditioning combination of highly bio-available Vitamin C, antioxidants, herbs and vitamins commonly used to lighten the skin. Vitamin C: Rosehips and Ascorbate are antioxidant forms of vitamin C. They help lighten the skin tone by inhibiting melanin production. Calcium (Calcium Ascorbate Complex): This essential nutrient plays a pivotal role in the body's collagen production, tissue repair, and resistance to infection. Calcium Threonate: This vitamin C metabolite generates increased blood levels of vitamin C. Scientists have observed that exposing cells to calcium threonate increases the intake of ascorbic acid by these cells. Quercetin (bioflavonoid): Quercetin occurs naturally in red wine, tea, and many types of fruits and vegetables. It functions as an antioxidant and skin-healing ingredient. Hesperidin: Hesperidin is a flavonoid compound that stimulates blood circulation, stimulating the surface circulation of the skin It improves dark circles under the eyes, dull complexion, and tired skin. It has antioxidant and UV absorption properties. Citrus Bioflavonoids: Bioflavonoids are powerful antioxidants that contribute toward healthy, more vibrant skin. They defend the skin against the damaging effects of stress, pollution, and age itself. They create a more even skin tone and reduce the appearance of age spots. Hesperidin limits the production of melanin and, unlike hydroquinone, does not have harmful side effects."
