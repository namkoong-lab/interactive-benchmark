      "The Mountain adult graphic tees are imported into the USA where the graphic design is printed onto the shirt using our unique process. This process helps create the unique look of our shirts where the images appear to be part of the clothing instead of just pasted on. Our process provides customers with a superior product that ensures our clothing keeps looking good after surviving the onslaught from your washing machine and dryer. To ensure you are receiving a genuine products please ensure you are purchasing from a reputable seller, such as amazon. Please avoid sellers from outside the USA. All products produced by The Mountain will have a mountain company stamp at the neck of the shirt. If you receive a counterfeit product, please contact amazon's help desk so they can take action against the counterfeiter and ensure you receive a genuine product. About the manufacturer: The Mountain as a company grew from dress roots when two lifelong friends moved from new jersey to new hampshire and began creating belts and buckles to sell. The most popular product was a buckle of a mountain on the back that became the company's calling card. When The Mountain incorporated and introduced its first t-shirt back in the early 90s, The Mountain company has defined itself an eco-friendly apparel manufacturer. On that epic moment in history we made a very important decision to put the environment first by choosing water based inks and organic reactive dyes as the foundation of our production process. Since then, our eco-friendly mindset has expanded and evolved into something that makes us pretty unique in our industry; and we are pretty proud of that."
