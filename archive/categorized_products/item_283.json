      "'I wouldn't have predicted the beautifully warm and understated arrangements I would find on this fine recording. These are the essence of old-fashioned traditional Christmas songs. I've listened to the whole thing through several times now, and just can't get enough of it.' - Ricahrd Banks- christmasreviews.com THIS IS IT! I've done my best to produce what I think is, one of the finest Christmas music CDs in years. Too bad only a select few- like YOU- may ever know this. So do me a favor, & your music- and especially your blues-loving friends, & tell them about this amazing CD. As with every Mr. Vegas Man product, this CD was lovingly made using only the finest ingredients, & that would include some of the finest musicians on the planet, many of whom reside right here in Ann Arbor, Michigan USA. On piano, there's PAT CRONLEY. Well, PAT's actually from Flint, Michigan USA, but, believe me, he does get around. \"Amazing\" doesn't even begin to describe this guy's personality & talent. First & foremost, he's kind & generous- a real mensch - a loving husband & father - an all around beautiful soul. As a musician, he's unparalleled. He has an amazing ear & as they say, & as you can hear on this CD, he really can play that thang. In Southeastern Michigan, he's widely known in jazz circles as among the crème de la crème of piano players, but I know him also for his extreme versatility & in being able to play virtually any style- with taste & skill. Personally, I love his occasional Floyd Cramer trill. And another little known tid-bit about PAT, the cat can sing. He's modest- & about that too. He specifically, & humbly, requested anonymity for his vocal contribution on this CD, but I'm going to publicly spill the beans here & now. That's PAT singing back-up on the HEY SANTA! Track. So many thanks to PAT, those of you who get to know this CD will get to know one of the finest talents this area has to offer, THE AMAZING PAT CRONLEY! Well, if you dig around enough on CD Baby looking at my Mr. Vegas Man CDs, you'll hear much more about some of the other various & sundry souls who have helped make me what I am today. And that's good, n'est pas? Thanks for visiting here, & I hope you enjoy listening to HEY SANTA! MERRY CHRISTMAS & BEST WISHES FROM, Mr. Vegas Man VEGAS BABY!"
