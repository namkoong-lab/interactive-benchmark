      "TuffRider Ladies Lexington Waterproof Short Country Boots",
      "are made with 100% waterproof leather and lining. These shorter country boots are ideal for wet and muddy days at the barn or on a stroll. This boot features a drawstring closure and elastic gussets for a secure fit while the rubber soles ensure safe footing in wet conditions. From country boots to dress boots and everyday riding wear, TuffRider has you covered. As soon as possible after every ride, gently wipe the dirt and sweat off your boots with a damp cloth or sponge.
