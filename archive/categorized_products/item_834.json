      "Blackcurrant Powder is made from the fruit of the blackcurrant shrub (also known as Black Currant) native to Europe and northern Asia. Blackcurrants are small, black berries that have been cultivated as early as the 11th century in Russia. During WWII, blackcurrants were used as a source of Vitamin C due to a shortage of citrus fruits in the UK. Extremely popular in the UK, blackcurrants were banned in the United States for many years due to erroneous belief that they were the cause of a tree problem. As a result, Americans have missed out on this highly nutritious fruit. Blackcurrant Powder is rich in Vitamin C and loaded with antioxidants, which protect the body from free radicals. It has a high concentration of polyphenols, anthocyanins, and GLA.* The high levels of anthocyanin found in blackcurrant are believed to help maintain eye health and promote healthy eyesight.* Blackcurrant may support immune function, supports cardiovascular function, supports the gut and the kidneys.* Lastly, Our Blackcurrant Powder is pure and natural without any fillers, additives and artificial flavors!"
