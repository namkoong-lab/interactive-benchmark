      "Product Description",
      "LIVING WITH WAR is Neil Young's new anti-war album, with tracks such as \"Impeach the President\" and \"Flags of Freedom\" Neil makes his political views known. This 10 track album is is a protest from beginning to end and a can't miss for Neil Young fans.",
      "Amazon.com",
      "Even if you don't agree with Neil Young's politics, you can't help but be daunted by the intersection of his genius and ire on his second album in less than seven months. It is the very rare artist who is able to channel indignation and moral disgust in such a coherent and forceful way--without sacrificing any of the vivid imagery, passion, or the high level of musicality that we have come to expect from him over the past four decades. But that's not what elevates this album: it's his pure, naked, visceral reaction to the Bush administration's foreign policy, building on a canon of outrage that he began with 1970's \"Ohio,\" penned in the wake of the Kent State student deaths. But here he goes one better, filling in the lines that he began to draw on 2003's",
      "Greendale",
      "about a family caught in changing times. But Young's done with musing about lost ideals. On",
      "Living with War",
      ", he demands much more from his audience, and himself. This is nothing less than a call for fearless action in extraordinarily fearful times.",
