    "average_rating": 4.6,
    "rating_number": 7,
    "features": [
      "This offer is for tumbled Vesuvianite from India. These are lovely stones, unheated, untreated, and 100% natural. They have only been tumble polished. Some people call this stone Vesonite, but that is incorrect; the Indians don't know the proper name and these other people are just repeating incorrect information rather than finding out the true name of the stone. It is Vesuvianite. It is also the common form of Idocrase, which is the gem grade of Vesuvianite.",
      "Color is a medium olive green, rarely with white quartz inclusions. You will not receive the exact stone in the photos, but similar from the same shipment these stones came from.",
      "Large = 8-15 g (3/4-1 1/4\"), XL = 15 to 22 g (1 - 1 1/2\"), XXL = 22 to 38 g (1 1/4 to 2\") these are \"average\" numbers",
      "This lovely item will be packaged in a soft, velour bag with stone certification card and official Fundamental Rockhound info card.",
      "Since these are natural stones, it is possible to have occasional inclusions of other minerals (usually white quartz), tiny pits, or crevices in the stone. For more information please see description below"

    "description": [
      "Vesuvianite / Idocrase was first discovered on Mount Vesuvius in Italy, where it got its name. It has also been found in Quebec, Canada. We carry vesuvianite from both India and Mali. Vesuvianite is the common stone, Idocrase is the gem grade stone. .... Metaphysically, Idocrase is an earth element ally used for regulating and organizing the mind and body. It helps to align one's thoughts with physical reality. Sometimes a disconnection between mind and body can seriously impair our ability to manifest our desires or goals. This is often due to ignoring the body in favor of developing the upper chakras and one's spiritual or mental bodies. Vesuvianite assists in reconnecting the mind to the body and ensuring that one's thoughts can become reality through aligned action. . . . . .. . ............. ....................
