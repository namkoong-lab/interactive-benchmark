      "MELTS MORE ICE, FASTER: Qik Joe Instant Ice Melt is specifically designed and formulated to clear ice and snow as quickly as possible; Its spherical shape bores straight down through ice and the calcium chloride formula works fast and prevents refreezing",
      "GENERATES HEAT ON CONTACT: Qik Joe uses an “exothermic action” to generate heat when pulling moisture out of the air to form its brine solution; This works more quickly than other products which require direct contact with moisture sources",
      "EFFECTIVE AT SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES: Because Qik Joe generates its own heat, it remains effective at temperatures down to -25° F; This will allow you clear surfaces in lower temperatures than other products which are ineffective below 30° F",
      "PREVENTS REFREEZING: Qik Joe prevents refreezing of ice and snow; Once your sidewalk, steps, driveway, or parking lot are clear, they will not refreeze; This provides safer conditions for cars and pedestrians in extreme cold weather",
      "EASY TO USE AND SAFE FOR LAWNS AND CONCRETE: Qik Joe is easy to apply with a shaker or straight from the bag; Does not harm grass, shrubs, plants, concrete, or asphalt; Leaves no unsightly white residue; Follow instructions on packaging for best results"

    "description": [
      "Qik Joe Ice Melt featuring Calcium Chloride Pellets is the best ice melter available. All de-icers need to form a brine solution to clear ice and snow; Qik Joe Ice Melt, with its “exothermic action”, generates a great deal of heat when pulling moisture out of the air to form its brine solution. This enables it to work quickly and efficiently to clear surfaces, even at temperatures of -25° F. Other products such as rock salt and potassium chloride become practically ineffective at temperatures of 30 to 25° F and work much more slowly because they generate no heat and need to come in direct contact with moisture to form their brine solutions. When used as directed, Qik Joe Ice Melt should not harm concrete or vegetation. It also will not leave any white residue. Choose the ice melt that is backed by a company first established in 1928! Choose Qik Joe Ice Melt!"
