      "Filthy Boy, who hurtled into 2013 with a Palma Violets support slot the same night Zane Lowe declared them his Next Hype on Radio 1, signed to Stranger Records at the end of last year. Helmed by 20-year-old frontman Paraic Morrissey and his transportive baritone, Filthy Boy's debut album is laced with romance, sweetness and intrigue. The Peckham boys, their number made up by Paraic's bass-playing brother Michael, guitarist Harry Weskin and drummer Ed Bernez, spent less than a week recording an opening statement that's as barbed as it is pleasant. Steeped in refreshing, classic-leaning guitar lines, melody and sticky, robust choruses, it acts as an imposing calling card for its creators' songwriting abilities. The album, recorded at Edwyn Collins' West Heath Studio is a chronological journey. \"We wanted to make a record that flows, we're happy with it, and we like the idea of creating a body of work that takes people somewhere,\" Paraic says. Guitars often shimmy towards the indie disco, although the first time the band came across their articulate forbears Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand was when journalists likened their music. There are echoes of Special Needs and Nick Cave too. Filthy Boy's is a quintessentially British brand of songwriting, humorous, flamboyant and cocksure, but also withdrawn, understated, even vulnerable."
