      "The SecurView is a custom mount CMOS color camera designed specifically for the Toyota Camry (2009-2011). The camera is designed to snap easily into place on the rear cargo hatch taking the place of the factory license plate illumination housing without having to use any major tools to trim or cut any part of the car. It is constructed of high-grade plastic to allow it to stand up to any harsh weather elements. It has a built-in distance meter so that when the camera is activated, the driver can accurately judge the distance behind the vehicle. This camera can be hooked up to any SecurView monitor or any other monitor that uses a standard RCA video cable input."
