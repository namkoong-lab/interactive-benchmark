    "description": [
      "Brightwell Aquatics CoralAmino is a complex that closely approximates ratios of amino acids present in many species of stony corals; the formulation is based upon extensive research conducted on tropical coral reefs by oceanographic researchers. While the ratios of amino acids present in coral tissue vary between species, general ratios are approximately maintained, enabling an effective average to be created that will benefit not only stony corals, but also soft corals, solitary, and colonial polyps. Corals maintained under optimal chemical and environmental conditions are able to reproduce (both sexually and asexually) more rapidly when the required nutrients are available. The presence of the free-form amino acids in Brightwell Aquatics CoralAmino is particularly important to corals that have undergone, or will undergo, fragmenting or other means of propagation in which some amount of tissue is damaged. For maximum growth and coloration in corals, use Brightwell Aquatics CoralAmino."
