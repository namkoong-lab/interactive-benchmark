    "description": [
      "The tool is a hoe like device with a pivoting joint which can be pushed in the culvert on top of the debris and is then activated by pulling the tool back out. The pulling action causes the tool to dive down into the debris and then you simply pull it out. It is made totally out of steel so it is very durable. The handle of the unit is 1/2\" threaded steel pipe ( which is not included with the tool because it is not economical for us to send you pipe through the mail) you can pick up a length of 1/2 pipe at your local plumbing supply or home center. For a extra long culvert like mine I needed (3) 10 foot lengths of pipe connected together with pipe couplings, but for most residential jobs one length of pipe is more than enough. You only need a long enough handle to get a little more than half way through the culvert, then you clean half the culvert from each end, so for a 12 foot long culvert an 8 foot long piece of pipe would be more than enough. For a longer culvert simply add more pieces of pipe. We stock sizes for standard 8\",10\",12\", 14\" and 18\" culverts, the tools are made smaller than the I.D. of the culvert to allow for clearance.(the 10\" tool is for 10\" diameter culverts and the 12\" tool is for 12\" diameter culvert pipes). You can use a smaller size tool to clean out larger culverts, it just takes a few more passes."
