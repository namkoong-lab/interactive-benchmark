      "Digitally remastered and expanded edition of this 1984 album from Neil AKA British comedian Nigel Planer. Neil, the long suffering hippy character from the hit TV series the Young Ones enjoyed a huge hit with a comic cover version of Traffic's 'Hole in My Shoe' and with this 'heavy' album. NEIL'S HEAVY CONCEPT ALBUM was a splendid parody that saw him cover songs such as 'My White Bicycle', 'The Gnome' and 'Golf Girl' and featured contributions from such respected musicians as Dave Stewart (from Progressive band Egg, who also produced the album), Barbara Gaskin, Gavin Harrison, Pip Pyle, Jakko Jakszyk and Jimmy Hastings. Comedians Stephen Fry, Roland Rivron and Dawn French also made appearances. NEIL'S HEAVY CONCEPT ALBUM is one of the finest parodies of Psychedelic and Progressive Rock culture. This reissue has been newly remastered from the original tapes and features four bonus tracks previously unreleased on CD, taken from the cassette release of the album and the B-side of the 'Hole in My Shoe'."
