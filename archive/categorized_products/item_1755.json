      "With both Dolby Digital and DTS surround decoding, S-video switching, 5.1-channel analog inputs, four digital-audio inputs, and the ability to deliver 100 watts across all five main channels, Pioneer's VSX-D509S is poised to satisfy many a movie and music fan. Its value goes deeper than its feature set, however: the VSX-D509S offers full-bodied sound with fine detail and texture. Vocals sound clear and well-defined, while the bass--crucial for dynamic surround-sound reproduction--is taut and authoritative. Operation is a breeze: the receiver's setup and controls work perfectly, and radio signals come in clear as crystal.",
      "Pioneer's four Advanced Theater modes (Musical, Drama, Action, and Expanded) enhance DTS and Dolby Digital playback, giving you plenty of options when it comes to surround-sound playback. Six stereo DSP (digital signal processing) modes for music simulate the sonic environment of a large wooden concert hall, a modern hall with stone walls, a jazz club, a dance club, and two different movie theaters.",
      "We like that the VSX-509S has S-video switching, a coaxial digital input, and 5.1-channel direct inputs, all of which are aimed at superior audio-video performance.",
      "Radio signals come in clear as a bell. Dolby digital and DTS surround processing are both excellent, and we even found the relatively subtle DSP modes to be more to our liking than usual.",
      "While we're pleased that Pioneer uses five-way binding posts for the front three channels, the surround channels use cheaper spring-loaded terminals, which require bare-wire connections--something to consider if you currently have banana-terminated speaker cable. This isn't a major shortcoming--most receivers use them--but we wish manufacturers would use identical connectors for all channels, especially in a performance-driven machine like this one.",
      "Pioneer's VSX-D509S's strengths are many, and the receiver represents a very fine value.",
