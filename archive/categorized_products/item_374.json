      "Weight of Words' ten tracks ooze character and liveliness. The group's raucous spirit shows there's still a love for a rousing rebel style here, but the rest of the original material displays how much the group has grown. The sonic mix is more robust and varied than ever with guest appearances from Hugh McMillan (Spirit of the West), Matthew Good bassist Rich Rriske, Rob Thomson (Hard Rock Miners), Ryan Robbins (Hellenkeller), Dino Dinicollo (Supertonic), and JP Carter."
