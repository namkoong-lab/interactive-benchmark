      "In the longest production run of any US produced piston engine fighter plane the Corsair was considered by some foes to be the most formidable of WWII. It’s unique inverted gull wing design makes it unmistakable in appearance and allowed for a large propeller and fully enclosed landing gear. It is one of the great Legends of warplane innovation and success."
