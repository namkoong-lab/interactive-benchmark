      "Fats Domino and Lloyd Price had put New Orleans as an R&B city on the map in the late 40s and early 50s but it was perhaps the teenage 'sweethearts' Shirley & Lee who helped propel New Orleans R&B into the maelstrom of American popular music. There is no question that Shirley & Lee made a major contribution to the history of rock & roll and rhythm & blues and the 62 tracks presented here tracks all of their singles up until 1962 in chronological order. Includes their first hit single \"I'm Gone\" and its B side \"Sweethearts\" which although not a hit was equally as popular along with \"Feel So Good\", \"Let The Good Times Roll\", \"I Feel Good\" plus many more. Detailed liner notes covering the duos career."
