      "Kay Kay and the Rays are a Texas blues band with soul, funk, jazz and roots rock influences fronted by former gospel singer Kay Kay Greenwade. Living Blues recently wrote \"Kay Kay Greenwade has established herself as a leading light of contemporary blues\". The group first hit the blues charts with the 2001 release Texas Justice which reached #15 on the Living Blues radio airplay report for May 2002. Produced by Johnny Rawls, it was described by Blues Revue as \"a seamless blend of blues, soul and funk...one of the most auspicious debuts of the year\". The Texas Jusice album opens with the controversial song Lone Star Justice and gave notice the band was going to write about more than traditional blues subjects of lost love, drinking and cheating although they cover those bases as well. The 2003 release, Big Bad Girl, was produced by multiple Grammy winner Jim Gaines. It reached # 10 on the blues charts in October 2003 and was still on the charts at #22 in November. It was the November Bluesville Pick on XM Satellite Radio. It has received rave reviews in both major blues publications, Blues Revue and Living Blues. The band was featured in an article entitled \"Soul of West Texas\" in the Feb-Mar Blues Revue. The performance at the 2003 WC Handy Festival will be shown on PBS stations in 2004. The band is touring exensively including a two week tour to Australia in 2004 highlighted by two performances at the International East Coast Blues and Roots Festival.",
      "The Rays are a veteran group of Texas musicians including award-winning guitarist Steve Lott, sax man Andy Roman (Andy Roman and the Roman Bros), bassist/songwriter Bob Trenchard, Dan Ferguson on keyboards and either JT Paz or Tito Roman on drums.",
