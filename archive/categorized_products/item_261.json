      "Formed in February 2014, Inglorious is fronted by Nathan James, who made a name for himself having sung for the multi-platinum selling Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and Scorpions guitar legend Uli Jon Roth.  Nathan was looking for like-minded musicians that desired to make incredible rock music in a very honest fashion. The band’s lineup on “Inglorious II” was completed by rhythm guitarist Wil Taylor, lead guitarist Andreas Eriksson, bassist Colin Parkinson and drummer Phil Beaver.Coming off the back of their eponymous debut album, which received widespread critical acclaim, Inglorious toured across the world, with numerous high profile shows in the UK and Europe – including show stopping performances at Download Festival 2016 and Ramblin' Man Fair 2016. Basing themselves in Liverpool to work on their follow-up, ‘Inglorious II’ was mixed by the legendary Kevin Shirley (Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith), and pays homage to iconic rock albums from the 1970s – many years before the band members were born – merged with a truly contemporary feel."
