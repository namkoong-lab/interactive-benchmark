      "Red Ramshorn Snails (aka Pink Ramshorn Snails) are colorful aquarium snails that are great for adding decoration to your home aquarium, but also serve some very useful purposes! They essentially act as aquarium cleaerers by wiping off glass or plastic aquarium walls, plants, tank decor, and aquarium substrate. These freshwater snails feed on uneaten fish food. Their shell colors are most commonly shades of pink, but the spectrum ranges from bright pink to dark red or maroon. These snails will arrive young and pea-sized, but may sometimes be smaller. Within two months, even the smallest snail will be adult breeding size, and the beautiful shell color will intensify as the snails age. Ultimately, these snails can grow up to 1 or 2 inches in diameter when fully grown. These snails are peaceful and can make a great addition to just about any kind of aquarium tank or planted aquarium, including an open aquarium or closed aquarium. They are totally safe with any nonaggressive fish (e.g. Rummy Nose Tetra, Discus fish, etc.), shrimp, other aquatic snails, and other fish tank animals. Basic aquarium supplies are required, such as an aquarium pump system (e.g. reactor pump, dosing pump, etc.). NOTE: Ramshorn snails are not picky at all about their water parameters, and they tend to reproduce like crazy in almost any conditions. If you run into problems with snail overpopulation, a few Assassin Snails will quickly take care of the problem. Because of their fast breeding, Ramshorn snails make an excellent live fish food starter colony for any fish that eats snails, such as Puffers.",
