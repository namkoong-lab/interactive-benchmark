      "2018 release. One of Germany's premiere hard 'n' heavy acts, Bonfire, can look back to a successful career which spans over three decades now. But no end in sight - in fact it's quite the contrary: Bonfire now release another fantastic album, titled Temple Of Lies, which marks their first for AFM Records and comes up with all the trademarks Bonfire are known for: anthemic songs, melodic-powerful guitar riffs and an amazing ballad... all fans of the band will embrace this new piece of work as a classic album very soon. The band was formed as Cacumen in 1972 by Hans Ziller but changed their name to Bonfire in 1986."
