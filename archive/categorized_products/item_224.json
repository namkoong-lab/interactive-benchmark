      "Throttle Elevator Music featuring Kamasi Washington returns for it's fourth album of eleven new outstanding compositions. Kamasi's saxophone sound is modern yet reminiscent of Pharoah, Kirk, and Coltrane. Joining Kamasi is virtuoso trumpet player Erik Jekabson, Mike Hughes on drums and Wide Hive writers Gregory Howe and Matt Montgomery. This record is sizzling and moving with soaring horns. Vinyl version!"
