      "The rediscovery of the three Serenades for flute and strings by the Franco-German Romantic Gouvy (1819-98), 2 of them commissioned by the Philharmonic Club of NY brings a welcome expansion to the repertoire of 19th century chamber music for flute. Gouvy's expert craftsmanship has not had the attention his warm-hearted music deserves."
