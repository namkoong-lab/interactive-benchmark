      "Professional pastry chefs and bakeries bake on aluminum sheets for perfect results. You can too, with our commercial quality Naturals® Bakeware collection. Made of pure aluminum, these premium pans produce evenly browned baked goods every time. Rims are reinforced with galvanized steel to prevent warping and aluminum will never rust. This standard jelly roll pan is slightly smaller than our half sheet. Fits European sized ovens. For baked veggies, French fries, muffins, cookies, cakes and more. Use & Care: 1. Before initial use and after subsequent uses, hand wash with warm, soapy water. 2. Dishwasher use is not advised, as discoloration will occur due to the cleaning agents used in automatic dishwasher detergent. This discoloration is merely cosmetic and will not affect baking properties or safety of the pan. 3. Natural aluminum pans work well with parchment paper, silicone baking mats, and also traditional butter or shortening and flour methods. When roasting savory foods such as vegetables, butter or cooking oil work well. 4. Nylon, wood, or silicone utensils are recommended. Metal utensils and scouring pads may scratch natural aluminum pans, but will not affect baking performance."
