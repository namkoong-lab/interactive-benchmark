      "Review",
      "Skeletonbreath is truly one of the most original bands not only in the instrumental scene, but in the music scene in general. --Punknews.orgNot the raging metal band you might expect from the name, Skeletonbreath is an innovative violin-bass-drums trio whose highly intricate instrumentals find the common ground between chamber music, klezmer and hard hitting art-rock. --Time Out New YorkThe East Coast instrumental trio combines bass, violin and drums to create dark and melodic, yet oddly catchy songs that'd make a sweet soundtrack for a haunted house in a rural Eastern Euro village. --Detroit Metro Times"
