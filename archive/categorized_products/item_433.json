      "Post-Apocalypto is the 2018 album from acclaimed rock duo and basically everyone's favorite band ever, Tenacious D - comprised of Jack Black and Kyle Gass. The album is the companion to the band's visual project Post-Apocalypto The Series, an original, six-part animated video series from the minds of Tenacious D. Each frame of every episode was hand-drawn by Jack himself, with every character voiced by Black and Gass. True to the title, Post-Apocalypto The Series finds Tenacious D thrust into a world of complete and utter destruction following the drop of an atomic bomb. Surviving the attack in class cinematic fashion (a good old imperishable 1950's refrigerator), the duo quickly learns that new forms of evil have spawned from the blast. One thing becomes apparent - for humanity to prevail, Tenacious D must save the world. All six episodes feature new Tenacious D songs, culminating in a new Tenacious D album - also called Post-Apocalypto. Produced by John Spiker, and featuring long-time collaborator Dave Grohl on drums, the Post-Apocalypto album is a genius addition to The D's already scintillating catalogue of rock greatness."
