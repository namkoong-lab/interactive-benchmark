        "A Colorful Home for Your Favorite Travel Memories We love traveling in this gorgeous country. After coming home from a trip, we bought a gray US photo map to enjoy our pictures. It worked, but lives aren’t all gray. So we made something a little more colorful and interesting. While we were at it, we smoothed out the bumpiest state lines and enlarged the smallest states for a less frustrating experience. Ease of set-up and attractiveness in your home were our top priorities when designing this USA photo map. What’s Included?-24” x 36” paper map -24” x 36” plastic cover with state outlines -Stencil sheet for cutting each state’s photo -70 double-sided stickies -Protective tube -Frame NOT included How Does it Work?1. Travel and take photos. 2. Print your photos (our website can be used to re-size or crop photos if needed). 3. Cut out your photos using the included stencil sheet and scissors or an exacto knife. 4. Stick your state-shaped photos to the map using the included stickies. 5. Cover your map with the plastic cover. 6. Frame your map or hang it up with thumbtacks. 7. Enjoy! Something to Make You Smile Your photo map will be a great way to reminisce about your favorite roadtrips and vacations. It will brighten up a room and is a great conversation starter too. This map is a thoughtful gift for travelers, retirees, couples, your partner (anniversary present anyone?), new graduates, and photographers.
