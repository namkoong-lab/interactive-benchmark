The earliest people obeyed her orbit, timed their months and holidays and celebrations and agriculture to the moon; the echoes of that system are still visible today, though the connection to the moon is often forgotten.Sarah Faith Gottesdiener is the leader of a movement to remind us of that lineage, guiding our rhythms and our sleep, our energy and our emotions, reminding us of our humanity and our magic.

        "\"I don’t know where I would be if I hadn’t been introduced to Sarah and her writings! ...Every time, I continue to learn more and more about myself and my connection to this existence. Sarah's writings are filled with the most fascinating facts from history, but also the language that speaks to your soul. I feel grounded, every time I open this book.\"―Mena Suvari, actor\"It’s evident that Sarah Gottesdiener has spent a significant amount of time diving deeply into the mysteries and offerings of the moon, and, luckily for us, has resurfaced with a perspective that is fresh, alluring, and much needed in today’s world. A perspective of Moon as teacher, reconnecting us to a world without patriarchal, industrialized control over our cycles, instincts, and true selves; inviting us to return to intuition and wildness.. A perspective of Moon as life goals, leading by example with her boundaries and honesty.. A perspective of Moon as mystic, “orbiting around a language beyond a language,” casting her luminous spell over us each night in myriad ways. In her beautifully poetic yet forthright way, Gottesdiener guides us through the cycles of the moon as a creative process: from the somber dreams and seedling spells of the new moon, to the glowing transformation of the full. This book is a beacon of healing, illuminating our inner realms through ritual, introspection, and more. For someone who recognizes how challenging it is to encapsulate the wonder, sacredness, and spiralic nature of moon magick into words, Gottesdiener has certainly done a magnificent job of doing so.\"―Chelsea Wolfe, musician, witch \"I've been a follower and fan of Sarah's work for years.
