        "When the sparks fly between Luke & Jezebel in the middle of a Human vs. Other race war, they are both singed by the outcome. Will they discover they are fated mates before it's too late?",
        "(This standalone story is part of the Creatures of Myth series.)In the year 2203, the tenuous truce between humans and Others straddles the line between hate rhetoric from the fanatical One Racers, and acceptance by more liberal humans. Angry cracks appear in this diplomatic accord when human children are kidnapped from their beds, and the Fae are blamed for their disappearance. Hired as the public relations expert for the Others, Jezi Longtree is excited to help the paranormal community restore its image among humans. Her eagerness turns into intense aggravation when she meets her contact, Luke Skylord. As Sentinel for the region, the man is infuriating, arrogant--and sexy as hell. Luke appreciates Jezebel's creative talents immediately--as well as her luscious body. Determined to make the voluptuous redhead his temporary bed-mate, his pursuit of the intriguing woman is relentless. When he finds himself on an unprecedented emotional roller coaster, Luke discovers there's more to Jezebel than Double Ds.",
