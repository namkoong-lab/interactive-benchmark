        "Academy Award® Winners Robert Redford and Sissy Spacek will steal your heart in this charming comedy about the mostly true story of Forrest Tucker (Redford) - from his daring prison escape at age 70 to an unprecedented string of bank heists that confounded authorities and enchanted the public. Wrapped up in the pursuit are detective John Hunt (Casey Affleck), who is captivated by Forrest's commitment to his craft, and Jewel (Spacek), the woman who loves him despite his criminal ways."
