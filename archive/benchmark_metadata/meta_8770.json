    "features": [
        "This book sets out the case for Hard Green, a conservative environmental agenda. Modern environmentalism, Peter Huber argues, destroys the environment. Captured as it has been by the Soft Green oligarchy of scientists, regulators, and lawyers, modern environmentalism does not conserve forests, oceans, lakes, and streams - it hastens their destruction. For all its scientific pretension, Soft Green is not green at all. Its effects are the opposites of green. This book lays out the alternative: a return to Yellowstone and the National Forests, the original environmentalism of Theodore Roosevelt and the conservation movement. Chapter by chapter,",
        "Hard Green",
        "takes on the big issues of environmental discourse from scarcity and pollution to efficiency and waste disposal. This is the Hard Green manifesto: Rediscover TAR. Reaffirm the conservationist ethic. Expose the Soft Green fallacy. Reverse the Soft Green agenda. Save the environment from the environmentalists."

        "Review",
        "\"Hard Green...moves the environmental debate beyond the trenches that the right and the left have been defending for two decades. Those in either camp who approach it with a halfway open mind may find that after reading Peter Huber, the idea of a new approach no longer sounds so crazy.\" --",
        "Chicago Tribune",
        "\"Mr. Huber persuasively and cleverly punctures conventional thinking.\" --",
        "The Wall Street Journal",
        "\"Peter Huber's brilliant exploration of the ideology of environmentalism takes the breath away by its ingenuity, intensity, and polemical artistry. It is the richest contribution ever made to the greening of the political mind.\" --",
        "William F. Buckley, Jr., Founder and Editor-in-Chief of The National Review and Recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom",
        "\"This book is a must read for anyone who really cares about preserving the environment. Peter Huber has combined his knowledge of true science with a lawyer's logic to destroy old myths and chart new pathways to keeping the planet truly green.\" --",
        "Walter Wriston, author of The Twilight of Sovereignty and former Chairman of Citicorp",
        "\"[Huber is an] excellent writer and provocative thinker.\" --",
