    "description": [
        "The filter can be rotated to determine the amount of reflection to be removed. Lens filters are translucent pieces of glass placed in front of a camera lens to alter or adjust the light entering the camera, and more importantly to protect the camera lens. Lens filters improve photographs by giving you control over light and allowing you to emphasize the features of a scene that you consider most important. This filter kit is a combination of the three essential filters no photographer should be without. PLEASE NOTE: Some cameras require an adapter tube to fit the filters."
