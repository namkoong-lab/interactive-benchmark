        "No need to mess with an icon. Gear up your star player in this boys' jacket and head out the door. The signature sheen of tricot and 3-Stripes give your MVP a winning adidas style. Wash and wear. Repeat. One universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing. For years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size."
