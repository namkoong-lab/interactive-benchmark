        "SOUL KITTENS CABARET",
        "(2010, NR, 147 Mins) Fueled by the bright lights and illusion of fame, we follow seven women on their journey to self-discovery as they struggle with temptation, personal demons and false promises. While trying to revive Detroit's hottest club in town, the Soul Kittens take customers on the ride of their lives with sultry sex appeal and silky vocals. Along the way, the Soul Kittens learn the real meaning of sisterhood from the yin and yang of reasoning, Good Conscience (Fantasia Barrino) and Bad Conscience (Faith Evans). Written and directed by Nicci Gilbert, this sensational stage musical has been thrilling audiences all over the country and now the Kittens can follow you home.",
        "BACHELOR PARTY",
        "(2011, NR, 92 Mins) 30-year-old Lance (Lamman Rucker, Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married Too?) is marrying Michelle (Essence Atkins, N-Secure), the girl of his dreams, and his closest buddies, Trey (Ginuwine), Reny (Christian Keyes, Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail) and Akeem (Keith Burke) are throwing him a bachelor party. What starts out as an innocent evening of fun and frolic quickly turns bitter when tempers flare, vendettas are revealed, painful memories surface, friendships are tested and love is measured by lies."
