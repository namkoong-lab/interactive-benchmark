        "Who stops drinking on New Year’s Eve?! The most sanctioned excuse - possibly ever - for mandatory drunkenness? Well, Tenley Summer for one.  She had already stopped too many times to count. Stopping wasn’t the problem. Staying stopped was. And yet, in 2010, she finally succeeds. Like Lewis Carroll’s Alice, Tenley experiences a life-changing rabbit moment that is also white (just involving light instead of critters). Catapulted into an Alice-style freefall, she is desperate to understand what just happened. So she embarks on a quest filled with colorful characters, snarky commentary and wtf conversations. Her nerdy love of research and insatiable curiosity eventually lead her to stumble upon an effective body-mind-spirit solution that addresses: - the physical issues of a body in withdrawal from the booze it’s addicted to; - how to mobilize the mind and its amazing powers; - the (dreaded) spiritual side of things. More than just the “nuts and bolts” of how to quit drinking, Make Mine a Virgin is a joyful, cheeky and self-deprecating celebration of how one drunk finally figured out how to stay stopped - for 30, 60, 90 days and beyond...and enjoyed (almost) every minute of it."
