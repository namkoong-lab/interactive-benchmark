        "SHIMANO TIRALEJO",
        "The actions and guide settings of the Tiralejo series were meticulously designed to match perfectly with the Shimano Ultegra XTD and Ultegra Ci4+ surf reels. Paired together, we refer to them as the Long Cast Concept, which allows surf casting anglers to achieve previously unachievable distances and catch those hard to reach fish.",
        "C4S Blank Material",
        "Shimano’s all new C4S blank construction utilizes a high modulus blank and wraps four outer layers of 90-degree graphite. This new construction increases the hoop strength for maximum pulling power without inhibiting sensitivity.",
        "PowerPro",
        "Tiralejo spinnings have been designed for the use of the PowerPro Line which not only has approximately 5 times the strength of a Monofilament line of the same diameter, but also lacks the stretching qualities, offering the fisherman a better feel."
