        "Change the color of a room's walls, floor, or ceiling, and the mood changes dramatically. Color can soothe or energize; make a space seem larger or more intimate; and transform ambiance -- all for a fraction of what other renovations cost. Experienced designers know what effect a change in color will have, but for most of us, repainting is something of a gamble. No longer. With",

        "Amazon.com Review",
        "One of the simplest and least expensive ways to dramatically alter a home is through the use of paint and color, and yet by far the largest number of people choose white and off-white paints for the bulk of their painting at home out of fear of making a mistake, opting for mundane and \"safe\" over dramatic and fun. This practical workbook takes the guesswork out of choosing color combinations for living rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and bedrooms by providing 11,264 (!) color combinations that the reader can examine by flipping over sections of the pages, changing the ceiling, wall, and floor colors in one setting for each kind of room. It is fun and exciting to see how the combinations produce dramatically different feelings for each identical space as you flip through the book, and doing so will inspire the reader to experiment and let the fantasies run wild. Unlike squinting at color swatches and trying to imagine what a room will look like with green walls, mauve floors, and a blue ceiling, all you have to do is arrange the sections of the pages, and there it is right before your eyes! This is a very inventive and very useful workbook that will inspire the timid, formerly \"off-white\" crowd to go for the bold and eye-catching color combinations they have always dreamed about but were reluctant to make happen.",

        "This is a flip book that allows readers to mix and match different color combinations for use in home decorating. Each of three sections (showing a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom) opens with a color key that gives an overview of all the colors shown on the following pages. Each page has a different color for the ceiling, wall, and floor and is physically split into three parts, allowing for myriad color combinations. One problem comes with the inability conveniently to match the colors shown on odd pages with those on even pages, and patrons may be tempted to remove their favorite combinations from the spiral binding. However, this creative work will be useful for amateurs as well as professional interior designers interested in exploring uncommon color combinations.
