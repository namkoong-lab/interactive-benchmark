        "The Rovers were sent to decimate the Southernlands. Instead, they awoke its savior. Ten years have passed since the Rover army tore through the Southernlands, leaving behind a trail of devastation and death. Most believed the attacks were random acts of brutality. The wise, however, knew the truth: the Rovers sought to destroy the one thing powerful enough to thwart their conquest. They were searching for the Papilion. A new commander, bent on completing the mission left unfinished by his predecessors, leads the Rovers back into the Southernlands. Fierce and determined, he comes armed with a precious artifact and a secret purpose. While the Southernlands reel under the new terror, the Purple Morrow, a harbinger of hope, appears to Jeru, an unsuspecting and solitary clan hunter. Finding himself enmeshed in a series of incredible events beyond his control, Jeru is compelled to take the first steps towards discovering his ultimate destiny."

        "About the Author",
        "Forde's love of writing began with an early interest in reading and of words in general. She was amazed at how linking words together in different ways had unexpected and pleasing results on others. People actually enjoyed what she created! This sparked a life-long desire to write all types of things, from short stories, novels, flash fiction, and poetry. Forde views writing as an amazing and intimate communication tool, meaning that it is a means through which she seeks to connect with people on a level deeper than intellect. Look for Wolf's Bane, the sequel to The Purple Morrow, in the New Year on right here on Amazon!
