Auto-Replenishing Technology supplies the skin with Caffeine to stimulate the skin. Aloe Water, Humectants and Hyaluronic Acid not only supply the skin with moisture but proceeds to lock it in and prevent dehydration. To use: Apply to the cleansed face above or below makeup. Alternatively, apply as a mask and leave for 5 minutes. - Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate 48ml: Help your skin to stay hydrated and keep moisture locked in with Clinique's Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate. It can be used before your moisturiser to help lock in even more moisture or at the end of your routine to seal everything you have applied. If used as a makeup primer, the skin will keep a fresh and radiant glow throughout the day. Can also be used around the eyes to boost the hydration of your eye cream. To use: Apply twice a day to a clean face, pump 2-3 times and spread evenly over the face. - Clinique All About Eyes 15ml: This is a lightweight cream-gel formula that diminishes the appearance of puffiness, darkness and fine lines around the eye area, and also helps to hold eye makeup in place. To use: Apply mornings and evenings to the cleansed eye area."
