        "Everley Donovan is living on borrowed time. The lone survivor of her family’s unexplained assassination, she was saved by an ingeniously crafted clockwork heart. But the time she was given won’t last forever. Now, every tick-tock reminds her how fragile her existence is and hastens her quest to expose Killian Markham, the navy admiral who shattered her world and left her for dead. But Everley’s hunt for justice will be a long and hard-won voyage.",
        "Her journey takes her to a penal colony on a cursed isle, where she will be married off and charged to build the new world. It is here, and beyond, that hidden realms hide, treasures are unearthed, her family secrets are buried, and young love will test the strength of her makeshift heart. When Everley discovers Markham may not be who he seems, her pursuit for truth is bound to his redemption, her tragic history, and her astonishing destiny."

        "“Readers will be drawn to this first in a new series from King (The Hundredth Queen Series) for the extensive mythology and the quickly paced adventures. Despite her delicate ticker, Everley herself is anything but fragile: her acerbic wit and single-minded focus on avenging her family will endear her to readers eager for a heroine neither perfect nor nice.”",
