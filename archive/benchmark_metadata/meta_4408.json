        "D-Force or Dual valve technology is the engine behind Danze multi-function showerheads and hand showers. Dual valve technology minimizes water pressure loss as settings change. Even at low water pressures the D-Force technology optimizes water intensity so performance can not be compromised. Danze, Inc. is a manufacturer of premium showerheads, faucets, bath accessories and vitreous china fixtures. Danze faucets were first available in 2001. The product line has rapidly developed to include over 1,500 decorative products including 15 collections of faucets for the bath, over 100 faucets for the kitchen and entertainment areas, 10 collections of matching bath accessories and an impressive line of spectacular brass shower products featuring over 130 styles of showerheads and unusual shower arms. Each product is backed with a limited \"lifetime\" warranty against defect; the company provides immediate access through toll free telephone to assist customers with technical, installation or other questions seven days a week. Danze products offer as standard such quality features as ceramic valves, heavy pattern brass construction, lead free waterways meeting the requirements of the ANSI/NSF 61 and a wide variety of durable and decorative finishes.",
