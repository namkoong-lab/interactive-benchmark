        "JJ Cole’s Luma Packable Carrier makes getting around easy and comfortable for both you and your baby. Unlike a complicated baby wrap, this lightweight baby carrier features a super soft feel for additional comfort and is simple to use. It slips right on and adjusts easily with a one size fits most design that can easily be swapped between parents while you’re both out and about with baby. The fabric is a unique blend of breathable mesh and soft stretch jersey to keep you and baby comfortable. With four different wearing positions to choose from, you’ll be able to keep your baby close, and your hands free, in the way that works best for the two of you from newborn to toddler.
