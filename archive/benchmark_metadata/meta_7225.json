        "At 2:30am on April 15, 1865, Mary Elizabeth Surratt was awakened by loud knocking at the door of her \"H\" Street boardinghouse in Washington, DC. Officers first inquired as to the whereabouts of her son, John Surratt. She was quickly told that her son was wanted in connection with the murder of President Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth -- an acquaintance of the family. Three days later, Mary found herself under suspicion and under arrest for involvement in the assassination of the president. Elizabeth Trindal has chronicled this almost forgotten figure in a key incident in what proved to be virtually the last days of the American civil war. Mary Surratt's son, John Surratt, was believed to have acted in a plot with John Wilkes Booth and others to not only murder the president, but also to kill Secretary of State Seward. John Surratt was out of the country, and Booth yet to be apprehended. But Mary and others were arrested in connection with the assassination of the president. Eventually they were brought to trial by a military commission. Tried by a military tribunal despite protests by her defense lawyers that it was illegal to try a civilian before a military court, Mary and three others were tried for the crime of conspiring with Booth and found guilty. Many prominent citizens pleaded with President Andrew Johnson for a stay of Mary's execution, but he steadfastly refused. On July 7, 1865, Mary Surratt along with the other accused assassins were hanged. In its grief over the death of President Lincoln, did America condemn an innocent woman to die? Mary Surratt: An American Tragedy is a moving account eliciting new debate on the subject of Lincoln's assassination in the closing days of the civil war. It offers new perspectives based on painstaking research over many years. Mary Surratt is absorbing reading from a gifted writer. --",

I would like to tell you about myself, and why and how the book about Mrs. Surratt was written.', \"When I first heard about Mary Surratt. I couldn't believe that my country would hang a deeply religious woman and the mother of three. Surely she must have been guilty. Nevertheless, I couldn't get the woman out of my mind, so I decided to do a little research. I hoped that what I learned would convince me that Mary Surratt was guilty as having been a conspirator in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. If she were guilty, good, I thought. She got what she deserved and I could move on with my life. Well, it didn't turn out that way. The more I learned, the more I had to know. Fortunately, I had the time to spend in researching.\", 'Sixty-five years after Mary Surratt was hanged, I was born. My parents were raised during Mary\\'s time of the Victorian period. The more I thought about it, the more I could see that Mrs. Surratt and I had a lot in common. Because of this and my research, I came to know her very well. I will say, we differed in one respect. My great great grandfather, Pvt. Michael Krebbs, fought on the Union side and was killed at Vicksburg. Mary Surratt\\'s son fought on the side of the Confederacy. I was born and lived near Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from what was Surrattsville, and is now Clinton, Maryland. Mary Jenkins Surratt attended The Academy for Young Ladies in Alexandria. The students were taught by Catholic sisters. I also attended Catholic schools and grew up a Catholic. The Catholic Church has undergone many changes, since Mary Surratt and I were Catholics. In those days, we were taught that priests were God\\'s representatives here on earth. Pretty heady stuff for a child, or anyone, as a matter of fact. As most converts to anything, Mary became an avowed believer in Catholicism. Catholics periodically went to confession. I can tell you, that both Mary Surratt and myself were taught, and we believed, that if we lied to a priest, we would suffer eternal damnation. We had been thoroughly indoctrinated as to what exactly hell was like. Eternal torture as the priests and sisters portrayed hell was terrifying. It was no wonder that Mary Jenkins left her ancestral Anglican Church and became a Catholic. Furthermore, by her Catholic teaching, she became convinced that any non-Catholic was sure to be condemned to hell. Mary not only became Catholic, but did her best to convert others to her newfound faith. With this in mind, it became impossible for me to believe that she would have lied to Father Walter, just before she was hanged, by saying that she had nothing to do with the assassination of President Lincoln. I am very fortunate that I had an intimate knowledge of my subject. If this wasn\\'t enough, like Mary Surratt, my mother had a boardinghouse in Washington, D.C. during the Depression. It was hard work, but from it I never met a stranger. To have a successful boarding house, one has to like people. Meals not only had to be good, but served in an atmosphere of congeniality. I remember the time that mother asked one of the \"paying guests\" to leave. Like George Atzerodt, the fellow imbibed too much in the devil\\'s brew. But I could not leave my research in the nostalgia of my memory bank.', 'To authenticate my research, I had to learn about the period that I was researching. Basically, what were the people like? Being a woman, Mary was held pretty much under her husband\\'s thumb. Her pleasure was to keep her husband happy. For most of Mary\\'s socio-economic life, she worked unrelentingly. In addition, she had the problem of a drinking husband and raising three children in an unhealthy environment of a drinking establishment. It was left up to her to find a place where her children could grow up in healthy surroundings. As hard as she worked, there was little money, consequently, she had to stifle her pride and ask for help from the Catholic Church. As time progressed, she had to not only take on more responsibility for the children, but also running the farm, tavern, post office, and serving meals and making beds available for the \"paying guests.\" Worry and work became her constant companions. As drink took more of a hold of her husband, John, her faith became her abiding strength. This becomes evident in the pitiful letters that she wrote to various priests, begging for help.', \"When the Civil War came to Maryland, research showed that she, Mary Surratt, had to play a balancing act between Union soldiers, and Confederate sympathizers. The Surratt's House and Tavern was a public house where drinking was done by both sides. She was literally sitting on a tinderbox of loose tongues that could explode at any time. The best that she could do to ameliorate the situation was to serve good food. When her son, Isaac, left for the Confederacy, she worried about his safety. When her daughter, Ann, graduated from school and returned home, then Mary worried about her daughter's safety with soldiers around. Then, when her husband died in 1862, her son, John, gave up school and decided to be a courier. I can believe Mrs. Surratt when she said that she never talked about anything political. Under those circumstances, I guess not. After she was arrested, she said, when questioned, that she thought the South had acted too fast. As a mother, she probably wished, as mother' today wish, that there would be no more wars and everyone could live in peace. Hard, cold research was vital to the book: Mary Surratt an American Tragedy, but being a mother myself, I could empathize with this woman, who was living in a very dangerous time. She not only multitasked, but multiworried as well. Common sense says she didn't have time to get involved in any plots.\", 'It has never been proven that Mrs. Surratt was involved in the abduction plot of President Lincoln. Quite to the contrary, as an example, one day, Mrs. Surratt asked her son, John, what was going on with all the comings and goings in the H Street house. She told her son that whatever it was she wanted it stopped. On another occasion, John told Lewis Paine/Powell to watch what he said when his mother and sister were present. Certainly, it has been shown that Mrs. Surratt had the safety and well being of her children as her prime concern. Logically, she would have never wanted her son involved in a dangerous plot to abduct President Lincoln', \"At the beginning of the book, I strongly suggested that the reader read the endnotes. They are not only interesting, but tremendously important. They show that those who testified against Mrs. Surratt did so under duress. Testimony gotten by duress is illegal. Robert Redford's film, The Conspirator, indicates the same thing. I would like very much to see another trial held where her name is cleared.\", \"There is not a day that passes that I don't think about the injustice of the Trial of the Conspirators. In addition, we must consider the descendants of Mary Surratt and how they have suffered these many years. Mary Surratt was not an evil woman and neither are her descendents. How would you like it if your g,g,g,g, grandmother had been unjustly hanged as one of the conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln? Think about it. At the very least, it was never proven that the poor woman was guilty. No, she was just taken off and hanged\", 'Below is a sample list of those who thought she was innocent. All were on the Union side.', 'Aiken, Frederick - One of Mary Surratt\\'s attorneys, said, \"such a woman could not conspire in the murder of the President.\"', 'Hancock, Major Gen.Winfield - The general said at the time of the execution, \"I have been in many a battle and have seen death and moved with it in disaster and victory. I\\'ve been in a living hell of fire, and shell, and grape, but by God, I\\'d sooner be there ten thousand times over than to give the order, this day, for the execution of that poor woman. But I am a soldier, sworn to obey, and obey I must.\" Would General Hancock have made such a statement had he thought Mary Surratt was guilty? I hardly think so.', \"Butler, Gen. Benjamine - General Butler proclaimed her innocence at President Johnson's Impeachment Hearings.\", 'Wood, Col.William P. - Superintendent of Old Capitol Prison. On the day of the execution, he tried to see the President Johnson, on behalf of Mary Surratt, but he was turned away by a White House Guard.', 'Honest endnotes are vital. I made absolutely sure that mine were not contorted in any way. Mary Surratt an American Tragedy, is not a contrived piece of work. That is why it took fifteen years of research before the writing began.']}"
