        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "In addition to his talents as a writer, talk-show host and composer, Allen, as we've learned from previous entries in this seriocomic series (Die Laughing, 1997, etc.), is no mean sleuth. This time, Allen, who narrates, and his (real-life) wife, Jayne Meadows, visit Honolulu to help Billy Markham, the hot young star of a new TV detective drama, Hawaiian Wave. Ostensibly guest-starring as villains in the show, Allen and Meadows must nab a mysterious red-headed, Volvo-driving stalker who has made Billy afraid to venture out of his heavily fortified beach house. On location, Allen finds a drowned man who resembles Billy. Soon the episode's quirky scriptwriter also drowns under mysterious circumstances. Our latter-day Nick and Nora investigate the usual showbiz suspects: jealous co-stars, the self-important director, a rich couple whose money may be running out. While detecting, Allen plugs previous books, his old movies and TV show and even a modern piano roll that plays his compositions. Devoted Allen fans may warm to the comic and self-styled renaissance man as private eye, but others may find this talky Hawaiian travelogue to be largely an ego trip.
