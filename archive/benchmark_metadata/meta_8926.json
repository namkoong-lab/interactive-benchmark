        "Series is widely used in preparing medical students for the clerkship shelf exams and the USMLE, and this psychiatry edition is, overall, quite good. The content is thorough, the questions concise, and the answers explained well. For those students who prefer to study using question-and answer type review books, this should fulfill their needs. It is nice to see an updated edition of this ever popular review book. 4 Stars!\"--",
