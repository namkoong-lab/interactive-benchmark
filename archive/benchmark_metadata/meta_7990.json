        "Review",
        "“As I was reading this book, I had the feeling that I was sitting in a pastor’s study, receiving the wise and kind counsel of Robert Morris. He comforted, challenged, and instructed me on the ways of prayer. He reminded me of some principles I know and introduced me to some I didn’t. By the end of the book, I was resolved to pray and never give up. I have a feeling that you will receive a similar blessing. Thank you, Robert, for the good word.” -- Max Lucado, Pastor and Bestselling Author -- Max Lucado",
