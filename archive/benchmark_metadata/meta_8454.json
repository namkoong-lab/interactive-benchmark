        "This addition to the Genreflecting Advisory Series is \"intended to help readers' advisors, librarians, and others develop a greater understanding of the mystery genre so they can make reading recommendations and successfully answer questions raised by readers who enjoy reading mysteries.\" The book is divided into two parts. In part 1, \"Introduction to Mystery Fiction,\" Niebuhr devotes considerable space to background material: discussion of readers'-advisory service in general and the appeal of mystery fiction in particular, and how to build and manage a mystery collection, followed by a history of the genre beginning in 1845. Part 2, \"The Literature,\" annotates more than 2,500 titles by more than 200 authors.",
        "Niebuhr take a fairly purist view of mystery, omitting crime, intrigue, thrillers, suspense, adventure novels, and true crime. This leaves \"mystery detective novels where a fictional character tries to solve a puzzle concerning a crime to the administration of justice.\" Chapters correspond to three types of detectives--amateur, public, and private--with several variations, such as lawyer detectives and ex-cop detectives. For each different type, as appropriate, Niebuhr identifies those writers who are \"historical founding members,\" \"golden agers,\" and \"modern practitioners.\" Under each writer, titles are grouped by detective and arranged in chronological order by publication date. This grouping by detective is useful because it corresponds to the way mysteries tend to be chosen and read. Each title entry includes publisher, date, and a brief annotation. An appendix lists print and electronic resources, organizations, and publishers. The volume concludes with author, title, character, subject, and location indexes. Niebuhr's type-of-detective approach is a useful way of classifying the factors that appeal to mystery readers, and the indexes offer alternative pointers to titles that readers might like.",
