        "When Billy and his dad are injured, Tom summons the courage to get back on the water to save them. This time, he must travel in a rickety old homemade canoe through the Alaska wilderness to get help. But it’s not just the canoe and the terrain he has to worry about—he’s surrounded by adversaries. Are his skills enough to fight them off or will his journey be cut short and Billy and his father left stranded?"

Paul’s debut middle grade adventure/survival novel, Surviving Bear Island, a Junior Library Guild Selection, came out in March 2015 from Move Books. His newest novel, The Wild Lands came out in January 2019 from Macmillan. Paul has two titles coming out in 2020: Hostile Territory (Macmillan Jan. 29, 2020) and Follow The River (Move Books March 10, 2020). When he’s not writing or teaching, Paul spends lots of time exploring the roadless areas of Alaska on foot and by kayak.']}"
