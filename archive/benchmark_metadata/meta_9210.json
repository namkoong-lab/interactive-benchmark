        "Review",
        "“Endlessly inventive . . . You might finish this overstuffed novel still unsure about the connection between Einstein and astral projection, but if you give in to Powers’s imaginative leaps and relentless pacing you may find that a mere quibble.” (New York Times Book Review )“The nonstop action of this diverting steampunk thriller will attract many readers.” (Library Journal on HIDE ME AMONG THE GRAVES )“[A] breathtaking achievement, the complexity of which a review can only begin to capture...[A] powerful work.” (Locus )“[I]nternational metaphysical intrigue involving time travel, Jewish mysticism, and Albert Einstein. . . . [I]t all somehow works in Powers’ wily storytelling logic. B+.” (Entertainment Weekly )“[An] intense, downhill-race of a story . . . the summer sleeper hit of 2006.” (Denver Post )“[A] stellar supernatural thriller.…Powers works an impressively original variation on the vampire theme....The meticulous attention to historical and literary detail grounds the story solidly in its period and enhances its imaginative reach.” (Publishers Weekly (starred review) on HIDE ME AMONG THE GRAVES )“A wild and wooly romp-fun.” (Library Journal )“Almost despite its wonderful weirdness, this thriller moves at a frantic clip . . . [the] very outlandishness [of Powers’s metaphysics] makes the story all the more compelling.” (Booklist )“Machiavellian . . . [A]n astonishingly sophisticated and engrossing narrative.” (Kirkus Reviews (starred review) )“A writer of extraordinary imaginative powers.” (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )“In this fast-paced nail-biter... the breakneck pace and labyrinthine plot pull us through history, mythology, mystery, and horror with [Powers’] signature creative verve. ” (Booklist on HIDE ME AMONG THE GRAVES )",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "London, winter of 1862, Adelaide McKee, a former prostitute, arrives on the doorstep of veterinarian John Crawford, a man she met once seven years earlier. Their brief meeting produced a child who, until now, had been presumed dead. McKee has learned that the girl lives—but that her life and soul are in mortal peril from a vampiric ghost. But this is no ordinary spirit; the bloodthirsty wraith is none other than John Polidori, the onetime physician to the mad, bad, and dangerous Romantic poet Lord Byron. Both McKee and Crawford have mysterious histories with creatures like Polidori, and their child is a prize the malevolent spirit covets dearly.",
        "Polidori is also the late uncle and supernatural muse to the poet Christina Rossetti and her brother, the painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. When she was just fourteen years old, Christina unwittingly brought Polidori's curse upon her family. But the curse bestowed unexpected blessings as well, inspiring Christina's poetry and Gabriel's paintings. But when Polidori resurrects Dante's dead wife—turning her into a horrifying vampire—and threatens other family members, Christina and Dante agree that they must destroy their monstrous uncle and break the spell, even if it means the end of their creative powers.",
        "Determined to save their daughter, McKee and Crawford join forces with the Rossettis, and soon these wildly mismatched allies are plunged into a supernatural London underworld whose existence goes beyond their wildest imaginings. Ultimately, each of these disparate individuals—the sensitive poet, the tortured painter, the straitlaced animal doctor, the reformed prostitute, and even their Artful Dodger–like young daughter—must choose between the banality and constraints of human life and the unholy immortality that Polidori offers.",
        "Sweeping from the mansions of London's high society to its grimy slums, the elegant salons of the West End to the pre-Roman catacombs beneath St. Paul's Cathedral,",
        "Hide Me Among the Graves",
        "blends the historical and the supernatural in a dazzling, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride—a modern horror story with a Victorian twist.",
