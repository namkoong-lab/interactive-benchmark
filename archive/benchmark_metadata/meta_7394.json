And Stud is in prison for, well, no one really knows for sure. To pass the time, the prisoners tell stories to each other. They do this to avoid going insane. The facts and fictions often get misconstrued with each inmate attempting to one up each other so that his story is the most dynamic of them all. Whether the story is about stalking, pedophiles or throat chlamydia, each tale plays some role in the healing process.When each prisoner bails the water from his toilet bowl the result is a communication system through the drainpipes. Nobody really knows who is telling the story, if the story is true and what the story actually means. The one certain is Unknown, the unofficial leader of this band of degenerates, who convinces each inmate to accept his action because the crime resulted in much needed legislation such as Amber Alert. But, as time progresses, even Unknown begins to question his stories.\"ANONYMOUS IS A THRILLING LITERARY HORROR NOVEL THAT WILL KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES!\"REVIEWS:\"Tanamor writes like a deformed love child of Chuck Palahniuk and Charles Bukowski who has finally discovered its own voice... a well-crafted piece of experimental, voyeuristic fiction from a promising writer with lots of potential... a winning jumble of the gritty, the raw, and the grotesque.\" - Publishers Weekly Starred Review\"Anonymous is one of those margin hugging novels that toes the line between a dark, edgy, cult gem and a commercial bestseller, and should satisfy aficionados of both.\" - Book Knurd\"...reveling in the vagaries of unreliable narration, Tanamor proves himself a master of the existential mystery: the question is never whodunit, but who is the 'who,' and how do we know that the 'it' ever really got done?\" - Small Press Reviews\"Reading Anonymous is like taking an audio tour of a high security jail, the tales told will shock, challenge and amuse in equal measure.

        "Review",
        "\"This novel from Tanamor is a winning jumble of the gritty, the raw, and the grotesque. Set in a prison, the book follows three inmates--Unknown (in for fraud), Ambiguous (in for murder), and Stud (in for reasons unknown)--as they communicate through the building's plumbing system,sharing stories and attempting to outdo each other with tales both shocking and bizarre. While the novel is slow going at first, readers who stick around will find the author soon hits his stride. Tanamor writes like a deformed love child of Chuck Palahniuk and Charles Bukowski who has finally discovered its own voice--and the result is arousing novel that will confuse just as often as it entertains. This is a well-crafted piece of experimental, voyeuristic fiction from a promising writer with lots of potential.\" -",

        "From the Author",
        "What is the book about?",
        "Anonymous was inspired by Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club. Palahniuk's stories aren't like ones you see every day. However, they are real stories that happen to real people. With Anonymous, I wanted to touch on stories that happen to real people that were not only interesting, but important. This book is similar to Palahniuk in the respect that the style and themes are similar. However, it stands on its own as an entertaining and intense story. I've heard or read many stories in my life, ones about murderers, rapists, con artists, whatever, and it seems that there is always one common link among them - that they never seem to fit the profile by everyday people. Whenever a murderer is being hauled away by the police, neighbors interviewed always say the same thing, \"He was always so nice. This doesn't seem like him.\" So, I thought I would write a book about these types of people - ordinary folks who do things that you would never accuse them of doing - which probably feeds into why innocent bystanders get duped or conned by them. It's titled Anonymous because of just that, \"I was conned by an ordinary, average looking person.\"People with messed up lives inspire me. They make me feel like my life is normal. I wanted to write a book with stories that people like to hear, but don't necessarily like to tell.",
        "When did you start writing the book?",
        "I started writing it in 2002 after I read a story about a couple of gangsters who got arrested. The two were put in different cells; they bailed the water from their toilets and used the empty bowls and drains as a means to contact each other. They inadvertently said the mob boss's name and that is how the FBI got them.",
        "How long did it take you to write it?",
        "The first draft took about a year. What really took so long was weaving the story line through this \"communication system\" of drains and finding a way to make sure each sub-story related while keeping its own identity.",
        "Were there any parts of the book where you struggled?",
        "The book is about prisoners telling stories to each other. Some of the stories are filthy and offensive - topics that prisoners may likely discuss while incarcerated.  I struggled in the sense that trying to personify some of these degenerates forced me to write about topics that I really wasn't comfortable or familiar with such as pedophilia and murder.",
        "What came easily?",
        "The style came easy. I took an online writing class with Chuck Palahniuk and he taught a lot of the same principles that he learned. The result was applying those same principles to Anonymous.",
        "Are your characters entirely fictitious or have you borrowed from real world people you know?",
        "Each inmate is pure fiction or based on either a story I've read or a person I know.  Much of the sex addict is a homogenized version of some friends I grew up with. Of course, some traits are personal as writers often write themselves into a character. I will leave those traits up to the reader to decide.We all know how important it is for writers to read. Are there any particular authors that have influenced how you write and, if so, how have they influenced you?My two favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk and Dave Barry (Big Trouble). These two specifically got me excited to read novels again. Anonymous is a combination of the two - disgusting and humorous, which sometimes are synonymous.",
        "Do you have a target reader?",
        "The majority of people who like Anonymous are those who accept alternative lifestyles like punk rockers, Goths, hippies, not really religious folks, etc. The other group are those who secretly like a good dirty joke they won't dare to repeat. Everybody has a friend who leans in and whispers a \"dead baby\" joke to you.  If you don't, then you're the one telling the joke.",
