My name is Kelli Shallal, MPH RD, I'm a Registered Dietitian and personal trainer based in Phoenix, Arizona. I received my Master's of Public Health from Loma Linda University in 2013 and became an RD shortly after that. Before I became a dietitian, I had NO IDEA how to cook or what healthy food was. In fact, I'd never seen green beans that weren't served in a can until I was 23! (Oh, and did I mention those canned green beans were served boiled with butter and sugar? Thanks to my very southern Grandma for that!)\", 'My mission is to help you achieve a balance between healthy and happy. A healthy lifestyle should include healthy food, fitness, stress management, sleep, treats, participation in social gatherings, and happiness. Balance is a subjective word, but I want to help you find a place where you are enjoying your life but also taking care of your health.', \"At this point in my career through private practice, my blog, my books, and meal planning service, I've helped thousands of people lose weight, improve their GI health, balance their hormones, and get organized in the kitchen. I can't wait to help you on your healthy living journey too!\"]}"
