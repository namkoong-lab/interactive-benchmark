        "About the Author",
        "Rich and Sue Freeman decided to make their living from what they lovebeing outdoors. In 1996 they left corporate jobs to spend six months hiking 2,200 miles on the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. That adventure deepened their love of the outdoors and inspired them to share this love by introducing others to the joys of hiking. Since most people dont have the option (let alone the desire) to undertake a six-month trek, they decided to focus on short hikes, near home. The result was the first edition of Take A Hike! Family Walks in the Rochester Area. They went on to explore hiking, backpacking, bicycling, skiing, and snowshoeing trails, waterfalls, and waterways for paddling throughout central and western New York State. Along the way, they kept discovering unique and beautiful places in this region. Driving to the trails and waterways often took them down back country roads were they saw unusual potato houses (to quote an architectural student visiting the area from New York City). Of course, these werent potato houses at all. They were cobblestone houses. They not only inspired the architectural student, but they inspired the Freemans to find out more and share their find with others. The Freemans 14th guidebook, Cobblestone Quest was the result of that curiosity. Rich and Sue have a passion for adventure and an inquisitiveness that continues. They have hiked the 500-mile-long Bruce Trail in Ontario, Canada, hiked on the Florida Trail, hiked across northern Spain on the Camino de Santiago Trail and hiked a 500-mile section of the International Appalachian Trail in Quebec, Canada. They have trekked to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. Recently they hiked the tropical forests and volcanic peaks of wild Hawaii and hiked across England. On bicycles they have crossed New York State on the Erie Canalway Trail and pedaled the C&O Canal Trail from Washington D.C. to Cumberland, Maryland. Take A Hike  Family Walks in New Yorks Finger Lakes Region and its companion Take Your Bike  Family Rides in New Yorks Finger Lakes Region are updates to the original Finger Lakes guidebooks. Between 1999 and these 2006 revisions, many new trails were built and the Freemans had fun discovering and exploring them  you will too! Since beginning their new career writing and publishing guidebooks, the Freemans have pared down their living expenses and are enjoying a simpler lifestyle. They now have control of their own destiny and the freedom to head out for a refreshing respite or to follow a new interest when the urge strikes. Still, their life is infinitely more cluttered than when they carried all their worldly needs on their backs for six months on the Appalachian Trail."
