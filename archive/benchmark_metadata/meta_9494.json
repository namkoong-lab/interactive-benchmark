        "An indirect descendant of Weatherford, Wells set out on a mystical journey to find him and her own identity. If my path was true, she says, I would know that hope can be reborn from deepest despair, and that, in the rebirth, each of us can choose who and what we will be. Weatherford was born c. 1775 to membership in his grandmother's Wind clan of the Alabama (Creek) tribe, the son of a mixed-blood mother and a prosperous Scots trader. Declared by his grandmother to have a special spiritual gift, he was sheltered from the Euro-American educational system and as a young man earned the name Red Eagle. Wells, born in south Mississippi to a family of Choctaw mixed-bloods, was made to feel different and unwelcome in mainstream society. In writing this book she sets forth to identify herself by a spiritual link with her kinsman and to understand his leadership in the Creek War of 1813-14.",
        "From exhaustive research and oral family stories she describes daily life and thinking among southeastern Indians in the Creek confederacy, and with her vivid insider perspective she recounts the historical facts. The cast of characters includes Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett, Tecumseh, Seekaboo, and runaway slaves. Shifting between historical episodes and the present, Wells pursues the true story of Red Eagle. Her suspenseful prose gives a visceral sense of how Indians felt as victims of the American government and of how they had no recourse but to fight. As her narrative progresses, Wells is transported in time and place, and alongside Weatherford she watches the Creek War unfold-with traditional Indian values and morals caught in the maelstrom. She expresses first-hand anguish as the war plays out with devastating effects on native tribes.",

        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "American history devolves, alas, into a self-satisfied New Age treatise. Wells, a mixed-blood historian from southern Mississippi, details the life of William Weatherford (17751824), also known as Red Eagle, who disavowed his Scots and French ancestry in favor of his Creek heritage to become a leader of resistance to white encroachment on his Georgia homeland. Wellss skill in crafting biography is solid, and her command of regional and Native American history is also generally strong, although she undermines her case by making any number of questionable assertions about the Europeans who eventually defeated Red Eagles warriors. (Were all the children of Europe, as she writes, really possessed by gluttonous appetites for land ownership, personal wealth, and power? Historians Philip Deloria and Jill Lepore have recently shown this was not the case.) But Wells isnt truly interested in the meat of history, meaty though this story is. Instead, she wants to use the vehicle of Weatherfords difficult, dramatic life to illuminate hers. Accepting Weatherford, a distant forebear, as something of a spirit guide, she embarks on a personal journey in search of an ethereal identity which I believed was simply genetic but which was in reality spiritual. That journey lifts Wellss book out of the history genre and plants it in fiction. Along the way, she relies on dream sequences, invented dialogue, and sundry anachronisms to forge her own version of Dances with Wolves, in which inherent Native American goodness is destroyed by inherent Anglo-Saxon badness. The result is a soulful mess. And its too bad, for Weatherfords story deserves a popular retelling. Wells seems too smitten with her own reflections on this strangely tragic career to impart any meaningful larger lessons. --",
