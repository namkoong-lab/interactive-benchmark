        "Something sinister is creeping over the northern duchy of Gramarye. Fleeing refugees carry rumors of a warlock army conquering barony after barony, invading and controlling the minds of innocent people.",
        "Rod Gallowglass, the Lord High Warlock of Gramarye, is sent to investigate, accompanied by his wife and children. Who is behind all the turmoil? The mysterious sorcerer Alfar who frightened peasants whisper about? Or something even worse?",
        "But before he can confront the rebel warlocks, Rod must find a way to reign in his violent, explosive temper. If he loses control at the wrong moment, he'll lose more than his temper, he'll lose his head — or, worse, his family!"

He always had difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality and has tried to compensate by teaching college. When teaching proved too real, he gave it up in favor of writing full time. He tried to pre-script his life, but couldn't understand why other people never get their lines right. This caused a fair amount of misunderstanding with his wife and four children. He wrote novels because it was the only way he could be the director, the designer, and all the actors too.\", 'Chris died in 2018 from Parkinson’s Disease. He will be remembered by his friends, family, fans, and students for his kind and gentle nature, his willingness to guide and mentor any who asked, and for his witty sense of humor. His terrible puns, however, will be forgotten as soon as humanly possible.']}"
