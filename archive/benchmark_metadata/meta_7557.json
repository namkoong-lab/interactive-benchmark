        "The Water Is Never Cold is a groundbreaking study of the birth of the U.S. Navy's combat demolition teams. Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDUs) and Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs), little-known predecessors of the Navy SEALs, played a crucial role in the Pacific and European theaters during World War II. As the vanguard for amphibious assaults, they were tasked with beach reconnaissance, depth sounding, and clearing obstacles, mines, and unexploded ordnance so the troops could land - all while exposed to enemy fire. Their work was as hazardous as it was indispensable O'Dell's history is based on painstaking archival research and inter-views with numerous veterans of the NCDUs and the UDTs, plus the people who influenced their development - the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Amphibious Scouts and Raiders, among others. He details the historical precedents that influenced the teams, as well as their innovation and experimentation with tactics, methods, and equipment. The reader will follow the NCDUs and the UDTs from their grueling training regimen through several of their key combat missions during the war. If not for the skillful work of these brave men, the successful landings at Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Normandy, and other critical battlefields might have been impossible."

        "Review",
        "I had the honor of knowing one of the men in the book. I grew up with his sons and he treated me like I was one of his own. He never spoke of his service. He never watched a war movie when it came on the television; he either changed the channel or shut the set off. He was a quiet man. These were real men. The description of the training and missions is full of detail that brings the story to life. It helped me understand some things about a man who I spent a lot of time around. It explained some of the stories my Dad told me about when they both worked in a logging camp in Oregon. The stories of the men in this book will make you appreciate the freedom you have today and the sacrifices they made over 50 years ago. They risked a lot for us and we owe it to them to learn about their sacrifice. --By Stuart E. PenningtonThe Navy SEALS are among the most heroic of all the brave men throughout military history. If you have an interest in where they came from, this is where you want to be. O'Dell has clearly done his homework. His depth of research is impressive, in both archival material and in interviews. O'Dell brings passion and intensity to his writing. It's all here. Enjoy. --By A CustomerI have read over 30 books on the subject of \"SEALs, Special Forces, Unconventional Warfare,etc.\" and I must say this book not only has the ability to keep the reader glued to this page turner, but the author has used more then enough research material to make his argument crystal clear. Having just finished college with writing a final paper on the subject, I only wish I had this book available at the time. Nevertheless this is a great summertime read that helps the reader visualize the action and danger that spawned the various commandos around today. Truly a phenomenal read! --By Evan",
