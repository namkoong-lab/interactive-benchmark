A survivor, Aryana has refused to look back, choosing instead to bury the trauma and devastating loss she endured.",

Realizing that she cannot go on without finding the truth, Aryana embarks on a quest that takes her back to Kabul—a battleground between the corrupt government and the fundamentalist Taliban—and through shadowy memories of the world she loved and lost.",
