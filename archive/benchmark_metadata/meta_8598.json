        "Join a boy and the moon in a fun good night story!In this perfect read-aloud story, a little boy warms up to the moon at bedtime. They have a sweet rapport, with the boy talking to the moon as if it were any other potential new friend. The boy asks the moon if it enjoys some of his favorite activities--and they share in some, like pretending to be pirates, together. But then the boy starts to think big. Can the moon see the city? Can the moon see the whole wide world? What are the moon's friends like? Soon the boy grows tired, says good night to the moon, and falls asleep."

        "PreS-Gr 1—A young, smiling boy sees the full moon outside his bedroom window and asks if it likes the same things he does—bouncing on his bed, going down \"the twisty, turny slide\" at the park, eating chocolate ice cream, and playing pirates. He asks if the moon can \"see the city…under the sea…the highest mountain…[and] the whole wide world.\" On a spread of children playing on a grassy hill in the moonlight, he asks, \"Do you have lots of friends, Moon?\" The next spread shows the boy flying through space in the \"Milky Way\" near the constellations Leo, Pegasus, and Little Bear. The boy returns to Earth and bids his friend \"Good night.\" Cheerful, acrylic cartoon illustrations depict the action on single pages and full spreads. There are plenty of picture books out there about the moon and the wonders of the natural world, and there's nothing particularly engaging about this one. Eric Carle's Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me (S & S., 1986), Liz Garton Scanlon's lyrical All the World (S. & S., 2009) and Deborah Diesen's The Pout-Pout Fish in the Big-Big Dark (Farrar, 2010) are better choices.—Laura Scott, Farmington Community Library, MI",

        "A cheery round moon with a small upturned nose is a little boy’s nighttime confidant in this offering by the author of the Horrid Henry series. A foil for the tot’s curiosity, the celestial being is peppered with dozens of questions. Does the moon like ice cream and bouncing on a bed? What does he pretend? Can he see everything the boy can or more? Cort’s illustrations reflect the little guy’s imagination: a mermaid swims with him beneath the sea, a slide twists around an ice-cream cone, and children cavort in a meadow under the stars. Royal-blue skies give the evening a happy look mirroring the child’s blue-walled bedroom, and the items surrounding the boy—a tabby cat, a stuffed toy monkey—have counterparts in his conjured world, with a happy-looking tiger roaming a jungle and simians sitting in a palm tree. The moon shines amiably down in most spreads and lends its moonbeam light to others. A sweet book of reassurance, this will stand out among the many bedtime volumes available on library shelves. Preschool-Kindergarten. --Karen Cruze",
