    "description": [
        "Nonni’s Biscotti grew out of a true Italian tradition in the little town of Lucca, Italy. There, amongst meandering cobblestone lanes and classic piazzas, our Nonni (an endearing term for Grandma) made biscotti to share with family and friends. When Nonni came to America almost a century ago, she brought the family recipe with her. Today that same family recipe is still used to give our biscotti its light crunchy texture that is delicately sweet."
