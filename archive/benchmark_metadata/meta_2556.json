I think the characters showed great courage in facing the challenges put in front of them. This book had it all loss, joy, doubt, love, and a decision that has to be made. This was a splendid book and I highly recommend it.\" - C.C., Amazon review",

        "\"Alice Kirks has given me a marvelous respite from my continued lockdown. Her Regency era world is well depicted including the social rules and gender restrictions that in different ways haunt her lovely characters. [...]. The journey was delightful, each of the main characters brave in their own right, and although a happy ending was assured in the Prologue, it didn't make the antics of Lady Sophia's mother, the introduction of a rival, and some personal fears any less engaging and worrisome. Kirk's writing style was entertaining and her characters were well developed and varied with dialogue that fit the era and the personalities. Quite enjoyable to the very last task, and I highly recommend this and other works of Alice Kirks!\" - K.C., Amazon review",
