    "features": [
        "ATmega32u4 onboad chip in QFN package",
        "5V power and logic, 16MHz clock rate, 2KB RAM and 28K FLASH",
        "Can act as a USB HID Keyboard, Mouse, MIDI or plain USB 'CDC' serial device",
        "Upgrade from the Pro Trinket 5V - native USB so it will work with all computers, USB serial debugging, and is a more reliable bootloader"

        "What's smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It's an ItsyBitsy! Small, powerful, Arduino-compatible - this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, but still with a bunch of pins.",
        "ItsyBitsy is only 1.4\" long by 0.7\" wide, but has 6 power pins, 6 analog & digital pins and 17 digital pins. It packs much of the same capability as an UNO. So it's great once you've finished up a prototype on a bigger Arduino compatible project, and want to make the project much smaller.",
        "The ItsyBitsy 32u4 5V 16MHz uses the Atmega32u4 chip, which is the same core chip in the Arduino Leonardo as well as the same chip we use in our Feather 32u4. It runs at the same speed and voltage of an UNO or Leonardo. So you'll be happy to hear that not only is ItsyBitsy programmable using the Arduino IDE as you already set up, but a vast number of Arduino projects will work out of the box!",
