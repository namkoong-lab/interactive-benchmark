        "The story of Reedville, Virginia, is linked to the commercial fishing industry that developed in the late 19th century. In 1874, Elijah Reed transferred his menhaden fishing operation from Brooklin, Maine, to the Chesapeake Bay. He purchased the land on Cockrell's Creek that is now Reedville. The industry flourished, especially in the early part of the 20th century. Today, Reedville is one of the major ports for the landing of commercial fish in the United States, second only to Kodiak, Alaska. This Northern Neck area of Virginia has a deep history dating back to Jamestown, and this book adds another chapter in retelling its past by providing unique photographs that have never been previously published."
