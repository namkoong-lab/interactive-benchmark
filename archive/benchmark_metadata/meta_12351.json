        "About Catherine Popesco Rambling about Paris, Catherine Popesco discovered a treasure trove of stampings and molds - in the old factories and workshops of Paris, many that were created by the artists of the celebrated jewelry period from the 1900-1930's. Most of these gems were originally designed by celebrated artists and shining lights of their era, such as Lalique, Mucha, Galle and Picasso. With her vivid imagination, Catherine uses the invaluable treasures of the French artistic heritage and style to create an exquisite collection of handmade jewelry, which are hand set with brilliant Swarovski crystals and delicately enameled. The elegant designs are made of \"old Silver\" a unique French process of laying sterling silver or 14k gold over a copper base. Catherine Popesco Designs are truly a timeless collection that reflects the art and culture of the past and holds a valuable place in the present."
