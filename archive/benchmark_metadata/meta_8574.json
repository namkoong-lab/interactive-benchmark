        "It made no sense.Eight men from the Midwest packed their bags and traveled to Iceland to find a cliff they'd seen in a music video. They went to remember. They went to reconnect. They went in search of a thin place.Thin places. The Celtic Christians used the term for those moments when the space between heaven and earth disappears and we come face to face with God. Thin places stir our souls and shake us out of routine. They alter our perspective and sometimes change our lives.Journey with Tim Bohlke, founder and director of Harbor Ministries, to the cliffs, the beaches, the mountain tops, and the quiet of his own living room as he recounts his own experiences in thin places. Learn with him how to incline your heart toward the quiet nudges from God so you'll be ready to turn aside and experience thin places for yourself."
