With more than seventy books to her credit, and the winner of three Hugo Awards, she is one of the most prolific and highly respected authors in the science fiction field. Cherryh was recently named a Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America. She lives in Washington state. She can be found at cherryh.com.",

        "The eighth book in the Foreigner saga finds Bren Cameron needing to exert all his diplomatic skills and call on all his allies among the atavi just to stay alive. Two candidates for the rulership of that formidable race are squaring off for a deadly and total confrontation, and the influence of foreigner Cameron is considered at least partly responsible for the situation. Meanwhile, Bren and some of the atavi are aware that another, deadlier alien race is emerging from the starlanes to disrupt the political and military calculations of all factions to date. Cherryh makes no pretense of keeping her sagas simple enough for readers to begin them this far into the sequence, but on the other hand, her world building, aliens, and suspense rank among the strongest in the whole sf field. May those strengths be sustained indefinitely, or at least until the end of Foreigner.",
