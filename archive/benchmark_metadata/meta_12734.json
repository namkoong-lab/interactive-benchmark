ASTM F2100-11 standards also call for mask packaging to be clearly labeled with the level of protection in one of three levels: 1, 2 or 3. This standard reinforces the importance of labeling to identify protection level, based on fluid resistance, filtration and breathability. This greatly simplifies the process of mask selection. ASTM F2100-11 is recognized by the FDA as the standard for medical face masks."
