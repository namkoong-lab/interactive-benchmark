        "\"The first novel of the XXI century\" already transalated into 39 language here in its latest edition: \"The Antrogynous edition\". A international bestseller (more than 110 editions in the World), Dictionary of the Khazars was cited by The New York Times Book Review as one of the best books of the year. Written in two versions, male and female (both available in Vintage International), which are identical save for seventeen crucial lines, Dictionary is the imaginary book of knowledge of the Khazars, a people who flourished somewhere beyond Transylvania between the seventh and ninth centuries. Eschewing conventional narrative and plot, this lexicon novel combines the dictionaries of the world's three major religions with entries that leap between past and future, featuring three unruly wise men, a book printed in poison ink, suicide by mirrors, a chimerical princess, a sect of priests who can infiltrate one's dreams, romances between the living and the dead, and much more. \"No chronology will be observed here, nor is one necessary. Hence each reader will put together the book for himself, as in a game of dominoes or cards, and, as with a mirror, he will get out of this dictionary as much as he puts into it, for you [...] cannot get more out of the truth than what you put into it.\" - Milorad Pavic “Dictionary of the Khazars” rivals Umberto Eco’s “The Name of the Rose” in wit, invention and intellect and exceeds it in sheer whodunit intricacy”. Douglas Seibold, Chicago Tribune \"As with Borges, or Garcia Marquez… Pavić knows how to support his textual legerdemain with superb portrait miniatures and entrancing anecdotes\" - Michael Dirda, Washington Post Cet heritier serbe de Borges, Perec, Tolkien et Calvino invite même le lecteur a festoyer sans reserve, et a « lire comme il mange en se servant de son oeil droit comme d' une fourchette et de son oeil gauche comme d un couteau,et en jetant les os par-dessus I'epaule » - Sabine Audrerie, La Croix"

        "From Library Journal",
        "Christina Pribicevic-Zoric. LC 88-45262. $19.95. f Yugoslav writer Pavic assures us that the Khazars were a nomadic people who settled near the Black Sea in the 7th century A.D. \"But their origins remain unknown and all traces of them have vanished.\" A thousand years later a Polish printer incorporated surviving knowledge of the Khazars into a dictionaryalmost all copies of which were burned by the Inquisition. Pavic's interlocking series of witty and fantastic tales purports to update that edition, but by now all \"facts\" about the forgotten nation are doubly conjectural. As if the truth weren't problematic enough already, Pavic has even produced his lexicon in \"male\" and \"female\" versions differing by only a few (highly significant!) words. This congeries will delight readers of Borges and Calvino, although libraries will need to buy both editions to satisfy them.Grove Koger, Boise P.L., Id.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
