        "Sam Hanna Bell's debut novel (1951), about life in a tight-knit Presbyterian community in turn-of-the-century Northern Ireland, was adapted for the screen by David Rudkin and directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan in 1990. Both as a novel and as a film, December Bride is a remarkable combination of passion and politics set against a rural backdrop of communal constraint and individual action. Visually and thematically, the film is a timely reinvestigation of Ulster Protestant history and culture, and in particular reclaims a tradition of radical independent thought exemplified by the work of Sam Hanna Bell. Drawing on previously unpublished archival material and new interviews, Lance Pettitt explores the intricate relationship between novel, screenplay and the wider film culture. December Bride is a consummate and provocative challenge to the politics of Irish society, its cinematic representations, and to the very process of film adaptation itself."

        "Choice",
        ")This title has been reviewed jointly with \"This Other Eden,\" by Fidelma Farley,\" and \"December Bride\". \"These three concise monographs initiate a collaboration between Cork University and the Irish Film Institute and a series titled \"Ireland into Film.\" In his brilliant study of John Huston's last film (1987), an adaptation of James Joyce's last short story, \"The Dead\" (1907), Barry analyzes the film's tripartite structure of repetition and variation, the serenity that derives from its mix of apprehension and irresolution, and both its fidelity to and its \"strong misreading\" of the Joyce source. Barry attributes four major changes to the unforeseen Irish national narrative of independence, the development of the Hollywood classic style, Huston's own auteurship, and the advent of Joyce criticism--that is, Huston's changes sensitively adjust to the intervening history and the shift in medium. Though the other two volumes focus on less-known--and lesser--films, they approach the standard Barry sets. Analyzing the politics of Ulster Protestantism in Thaddeus O'Sullivan's 1990 film of Sam Hanna Bell's novel December Bride (1951), Pettitt considers Bell's own stage and radio adaptations and David Rudkin's screenplay, the plot's source, and the film's afterlife on television and home video. Pettitt's primary focus is the historical context of both the novel and its processes of adaptation. Farley examines how Muriel Box's 1959 film provides a comedic treatment of the legacy of the Civil War and Michael Collins's death and how the film anticipates the Irish cinema's major themes of 20 years later--oppression, emigration, the power of the church, nationalist martyrdom, illegitimacy, anti-English hostility, and national identity--noting that the film mocks the Irish while depicting British romanticizing of the Irish.\" (Lance Pettitt)",
