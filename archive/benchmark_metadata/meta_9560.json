        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "In this useful home healthcare guide, Carroll offers the insight of a nurse to help readers understand and treat common medical conditions such as skin rashes and joint pains. Rather than following the general practice of organizing a self-care guide around specific diagnoses-which, she argues, makes such guides \"hard to use unless you can diagnose yourself correctly first\"-she lists the topics by symptoms, starting with the most common medical complaint: headaches. She then works through topics like eye irritation, toothaches, constipation and dizziness. In each section, she explains what the symptoms look and feel like, answers FAQs and decisively informs readers when the symptoms might be serious enough to warrant a call to a healthcare pro or a trip to the emergency room. The book also includes information on dealing with injuries like sprains and cuts, choosing and using medications, fighting through the difficulties of the healthcare system and having surgery. Through it all, the tone is accessible, friendly and easy-to-understand-just as a one might hope a good nurse would be.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
