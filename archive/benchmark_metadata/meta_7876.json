        "Three master educators and literature experts just made planning reading instruction much easier—and learning literary elements more engaging. This resource compiles more than 100 annotations of new and classic picture books that model the use of key literary elements and appeal to grades 4-8 students. Organized by eight key literary elements—setting, point of view, plot, characterization, theme, foreshadowing, flashback, and figurative language—each section includes an introduction to the literary element, an annotated list of books describing why they work well for the selected literary element, and two literary-element-focused lessons on specific books. For use with Grades 4-8."
