        "Wealthy passengers line up to be the first on a nostalgic trip across the Atlantic on the USS Britannica. But things take a dangerous turn when Josef and his gang of death-dealing pirates hijack the Britannica, threatening to sink the ship unless all their demands are met. One man manages to escape the pirates' detection - Aaron Carpenter, a security guard for a wealthy heiress, who is the only person on board who may be able to avert disaster. But history begins to repeat itself when a stray bullet breaches the ship's hull, sending a wall of icy water crashing onto the ship's deck. Racing against the clock, Carpenter must struggle to disarm the pirates, while trying to save the passengers from a horrifying death at sea."
