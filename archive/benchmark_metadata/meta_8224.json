This includes his River City series (an ensemble cast of police officers) and his SpoCompton series (a rotating cast of criminals).', 'Background: Frank served in the U.S. Army from 1986-91 in military intelligence as a Czechoslovak linguist. In 1993, he became a police officer in Spokane, Washington. During his career, he worked as a patrol officer, corporal, and detective. In 2002, he became a sergeant and entered into leadership roles. He was fortunate enough to command patrol officers, investigators, the K-9 unit, and the SWAT team.', 'Frank retired from law enforcement in 2013 as a captain in order to write full time and to teach. From 2013-17, he taught law enforcement subject matter at community college, university, and as an independent consultant for an international non-profit. He also taught a series of writing workshops, but mostly he worked on being a full-time writer.', 'Frank earned a BA in History from Eastern Washington University in 1998, and an MS in Administration of Justice from the University of Louisville in 2012.', 'Writing Career: Frank began writing seriously at about thirteen. In 1995, he started the first draft of Under A Raging Moon, which would become the first book in the River City series of police procedurals. River City, a fictional version of Spokane, Washington, features an ensemble cast of officers, detectives, and leaders as they face a variety of crises over the course of the series.', 'River City is also the setting for Frank’s series of Stefan Kopriva mysteries. Novels such as The Last Horseman and the Spocompton series are set in Spokane proper, while other books include a variety of different settings, such as the Ania series with Jim Wilsky (set in Chicago, Las Vegas, Northern California, and the Florida coast). The Bricks and Cam Job series he wrote with Eric Beetner has a distinctive east coast flavor, as do his novels with Lawrence Kelter (The Last Collar, Fallen City).', \"In 2019, Frank teamed up with Colin Conway for a new series set in Spokane, the Charlie-316 series of police procedurals. That same year, Frank created (and edits) the novella anthology series, A Grifter's Song.\", 'Frank has held the #1 author spot for police procedurals on Amazon, and remains a prolific author with over forty novels to his credit. Frank’s books are available in all formats — paperback, ebook, and audio book.', 'In addition to novels, dozens of Franks’ short stories have been published in magazines and numerous anthologies. He is a four-time finalist for the Derringer Award (given by the Short Mystery Fiction Society). His stories have won three PSWA awards, and many of his novels and stories were recognized in 2023 by the Independent Fiction Alliance as being among the \"best of the TRULY independent.\"', 'Frank also writes mainstream fiction under his real name, Frank Scalise, and fantasy under the name Frank Saverio. He currently resides in Redmond, Oregon, with his wife, Kristi. He is an avid hockey fan, reader, movie lover, gamer, and a tortured guitarist.']}"
