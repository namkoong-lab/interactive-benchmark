        "In the year 2016, the drug cartel war has exploded into downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana!It’s in this deadly environment, a country’s future will hang on the choices extreme rivals will make, in an action-packed hunt for a seemingly-cursed Civil War treasure, so valuable, that as evidence, its secret is powerful enough to end a treacherous conspiracy to take full control over Homeland Security – or see to it that the plot succeeds! And entering into this adventure are over a half-dozen men with special skills ranging from officers of the law, organized crime figures, politicians, gangsters, the daring archaeologist Dr. Darren Hughes, several mysterious women, and LSU freshman, Tony Porter, who’s just smitten with the ladies. At stake is the highly profitable fast and furious flow of guns going south and drugs flowing north, and one woman’s mission to foil the restructuring of the new Villetti crime family that’s formalizing some very dangerous alliances south of the United States’ border. Going down amidst all the sex trafficking, prohibited weapons exchanges, illegal immigration, and the ever-present corruption in the failed war with the Mexican drug cartels – and with the shootings of police officers, clashes between the races, and the U.S. Presidential Election all in the mix – is a nail-biting mystery over the triumphant femme fatale’s real identity, and how Naomi or Davina will react when in the aftermath of catastrophic flooding of the Gulf state, one survivor’s tempted by the ultimate opportunity to gain significant control over everything!Meanwhile, the bodies keep on falling, when six Louisiana State students also find themselves in the crossfire after their popular teacher disappears, and they unwisely decide to complete the highly-suspicious quest for fortune and glory on which he vanished, entirely on their own. Only a Class Five Hurricane making landfall, will interrupt everyone’s plans and throw all the contestants in this heist, into one whirlpool of crazy alliances born out of extraordinary desperation in times of region-wide devastation! And to survive, one disillusioned young woman learns she must choose between fighting for justice over what has gone down in the past, or for what is in her own best interest to survive through the present. Then everyone learns what will comprise the true destruction for any cover, one nation’s real buried values might have ever had – while stumbling toward an uncertain, and probably volatile future. Dare to join the quest, on this dark journey to discover enlightenment. THE TRUTH HAS VALUE. CLASS IS JUST AN ACT."

        "\"",
        "This book is a hidden gem. The writer was able to create a fast paced atmosphere for his characters that will prevent you from putting down the book until you finish it. In fact, the more you read, the more you want. His story line has a complexity hard to find among new authors and a polishing that comes from evident high standards. I am looking forward to more books published by Joshua Weiselberg.\"",
        "MODyssey says: Excellent story with very in-depth character development. I'm really excited to see how the story continues in the future.",
        "About the Author",
        "Joshua Adam Weiselberg has been a writer his entire life, the son of an English professor and a Navy commander. His interest and respect for history brought him to love to research and learn ever more about the subjects he is intrigued to write about. Taking it a step further, Josh immerses himself in the action-adventures and has years of experience as a re-enactor in military strategy and combat in the infantry, artillery, on horseback, and on United States Naval ships to specifically include 19th century sailing warships, and an actual F-18 flight simulator. His on-screen performances include frequent outings for westerns, most recently ABC's hit series Castle, and HBO's Family Tree, besides documentaries for the Discovery family of learning channels. He frequently signs his books at public events tied into the re-enactments or at historical society meetings where Josh presents his research and demonstrates the alignment between the fiction aspects of his stories, and the facts, by putting them on the actual maps. He loves to interact with his readers in person, as well as online. Josh grew up an avid fan of baseball beyond all other sports and has played the game since childhood up through his current participation in amateur adult leagues. He has visited many professional ballparks but favorite memories include going to Wrigley Field with his grandpa, and marching around many a stadium with his teammates as a Little Leaguer. He keeps a bat, helmet, and gloves in his vehicle at all times for the spontaneous stop at a batting cage while Josh is on the road. Indeed he likes to plot his stories while hitting baseballs as much as while listening to some good rock 'n roll. He is also a fan of intense action-adventure-drama and writes in shocking detail that he hopes appeals to audiences of his favorite entertainment that includes such programs as Hell on Wheels and Sons of Anarchy. Josh's writing pace and style has been likened by his readers to Louis D'Amour's fast action westerns and has assembled a team for BURIED VALUES MEDIA GROUP to include a regular editor with a background with New York's premier publishing houses and a cover artist who's worked on such famous projects as Star Wars and Tomb Raider, adding posters and specialty apparel to the Buried Values product line. He hopes you too will enjoy Buried Values."
