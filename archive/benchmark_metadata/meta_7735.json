        "\"Ma, I just kind of accidentally bought a horse so I’ll need the trailer.\" No one wanted the rejected gelding. Even Simon's mother told her son he was crazy to buy the horse. But Simon never listened to other people, otherwise he wouldn't have decided to forgo going to college to become a working student at an eventing barn in the first place. Simon has always struggled--with fitting in, with being a poor boy in a rich man's sport, and also with being a gay man. To be a rider, after all, is to be...Fortune's Fool."
