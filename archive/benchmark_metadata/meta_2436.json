He started his first business at the age of 18, as soon as he left school, and before long he was earning a significant income from it. This success led him to explore other ideas and soon he was building a reputation for himself as an entrepreneur who had a Midas touch when it came to profit margins. Seeing that many others could benefit from his wisdom when it came to working online, Robert decided to write about what he believed would be the best opportunities for those were starting out. With his books Robert helps people to find success and earn money, just like he did.",
