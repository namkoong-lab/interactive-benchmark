        "Help your students move beyond the spiritual high they experience at the moment of salvation and grow in their relationship in Christ. In our experience with Christ, we do not move from moment to moment. We move from experience to experience. It's when we understand this that we are able to allow our experiences to move us closer to who God is. It's not a matter of starting over after we fail or make a mistake; it's a matter of learning and growing from our failures and mistakes."
