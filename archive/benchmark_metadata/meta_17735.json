        "The Hamilton Halter is a picture of strength and beauty that has been widely accepted by horse owners throughout America. Each halter is made of over 16 feet of 100% nylon web, double sewn and triple-thick. Its 100% nylon thread is sewn in a diamond tack design to give the halter form and rigidity for a superior fit. It is dramatically stronger than stitching in a single line or with a conventional bar tack. Five solid brass eyelets attached in burn holes give the halter a double wall of protection against eyelet fray. The three double-welded rings, two custom stress point squares and one double bar head buckle are designed to sit much flatter on the horse's head and eliminate any contact irritation. The 1D Halters and Arabian Halters come with a solid brass tip which makes buckling easier than ever before. It also gives the distinctive look that makes it a Hamilton Halter. Hamilton-The Cadillac of halters."
