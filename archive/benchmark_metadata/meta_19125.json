        "All of our plastic ice bags meet USDA specifications and made from a production process that generate best suited ice bags. They come with cotton drawstrings for easy hauling. They are specially designed to offer highest clarity, low haze, highest gloss, high impact strength, and greater durability. We use heavy guage metallocene low density polyethylene (LDPE) film to manufacture these bags that are formulated for freezing temperature, greater strength, excellent puncture resistance, and rough handling. These bags are constructed with side gussets for easier handling and bottom seal to reduce breakage. These bags can be heat sealed, stapled, or tied. They contain EVA & Metallocene for more strength, cold storage, and puncture resistance. 20 Pounds ice with drawstring can cool approximately 27 cans. Most common size used in grocery stores, gas stations, ice house vending machines, convenience stores, caterers, fishing charters, liquor stores, bait shops, and warehouse clubs."
