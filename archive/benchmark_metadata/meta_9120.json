        "Since 1993, the Inlander has been sharing stories of the people and events that have made the Inland Northwest so unique. Now you can read 15 of them in Inlander Histories, Volume 2. You’ll meet the man who not only survived Prohibition, but thrived right on through the dry years. Read all about the Sisters of Providence, who built Spokane’s first hospital from the back of a pony. And then there’s the legend of Nat Park and how a certain couple’s connections brought the Looff Carrousel to Spokane. Local historians and authors first brought these people to life in the pages of the Inlander, and now they’re collected here, including: Jess Walter on Dashiell Hammett’s Davenport detour; Sheri Boggs on Bing Crosby’s deep ties to his hometown; Jack Nisbet on Mourning Dove’s mark on regional lit; and Robert Carriker on Lewis and Clark’s continental crossing. You’ll find that and more inside Inlander Histories, Vol. 2."
