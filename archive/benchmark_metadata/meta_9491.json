        "is a colorful collection of papier mache projects by artist and teacher Gilat Nadivi. With an emphasis on recycling everyday items to create one-of-a-kind masterpieces, Nadivi instructs readers on how simple materials, basic techniques, and a healthy measure of imagination can be combined to make a range of distinctive creations.

After trying out a few projects in the book, readers will find their eyes open to the artistic potential waiting to be discovered in basements, garages, and recycling boxes.",
        "Tools for these projects are minimal, and supplies are easy to find. As for guidance and inspiration, readers will find plenty of both within the pages of",

It also includes suggestions about items that can be reused (and revived!) through papier mache.
