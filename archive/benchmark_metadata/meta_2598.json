As a firm Christian, truth begins with God’s word and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that calls us all to love God and love others and to give our very best in all we do.', 'David and his wife are the parents of two and treasure their time together living, laughing, and loving. From their daily routine, to their avid church involvement, and even to their far-flung adventures, the Groces know how to make the most of every moment.', 'David is a practicing Attorney and Counselor at law, serving the varied needs of small business owners, including sales, mergers and acquisitions, estate planning, real estate law, tax planning, and tax preparation. Small-business owners embody the rugged individualism and determination that makes the American Dream come true, and David loves contributing to their success.', 'Outside of family, church, and work, David occasionally finds himself afield hunting, fishing, motorcycling, and exploring the glory of the Great Outdoors.', 'Countless teachers, instructors, and professors have poured into David’s life and helped him earn his Bachelor of Arts Magna Cum Laude from Oklahoma Baptist University, Master of Taxation and Juris Doctor from Baylor University, and a Second Degree Black Belt in American Karate. He feels he was blessed beyond measure by their skills and their wisdom, which he carries with him wherever he goes—along with a flashlight and pocket knife.']}"
