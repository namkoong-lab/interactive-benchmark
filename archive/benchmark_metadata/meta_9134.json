If these critical lifelines can be severed, Ukrainian resistance fighters might have a chance at reclaiming independence. To make this possible, former U.S. naval officer Jake Slate and international arms dealer Pierre Renard must wage a clandestine war against the Russian navy.

        "About the Author",
        "After John Monteith graduated from the Naval Academy in 1991, his career in the U.S. Navy included service aboard a nuclear ballistic missile submarine and a tour as a top-rated instructor of combat tactics at the U.S. Naval Submarine School. Since his transition to civilian life, he has continued to pursue his interest in cutting-edge technology. He currently lives in the Detroit area, where he works in engineering when he's not busy cranking out high-tech naval action thrillers. John Monteith writes the award-winning and best-selling Rogue Submarine series, which pairs an arms-dealing Frenchman named Pierre Renard with a renegade American ex-naval officer, Jake Slate. The series, published by Stealth Books, includes ROGUE AVENGER (2005), ROGUE BETRAYER (2007), ROGUE CRUSADER (2010), ROGUE DEFENDER (2013), ROGUE ENFORCER (2014), ROGUE FORTRESS (2015), ROGUE GOLIATH (2015), ROGUE HUNTER (2016), ROGUE INVADER (2017), and ROGUE JUSTICE (2017)."
