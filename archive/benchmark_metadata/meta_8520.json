        "After nine years of exile from her estranged, wealthy family, Sydney Chapin returns to Washington, D.C., hoping to find reconciliation-until her journalist sister is brutally killed. Now the stunned and devastated Sydney seeks justice and vows to uncover the truth behind her sister's death. Investigating this monstrous crime, detectives Jack Cassian and Darius Train suspect that this murder has a dark, hidden dimension.

        "reporter Elizabeth Creay. The fortuitous crime-scene find of a cigarette lighter with a clear fingerprint leads the detectives to local drug dealer Jerome Washington. It's a tidy but far too convenient arrest. The commissioner of police is upset when Train and Cassian move on to a number of other suspects, some of them highly placed among the city's powerful ruling class. The heart of the murder may lie in the history of the American eugenics movement, \"the science of controlling the gene pool—improving it, in theory—through selective breeding.\" The uncovering of long-buried secret experiments at the Virginia Juvenile Institute for the Mentally Defective, a state facility where thousands of people were once sterilized, results in more murders. The denouement is so murky that baffled readers will find themselves scratching their heads in dismay. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "The mutilated body of Elizabeth Creay, investigative reporter for THE WASHINGTON POST, is found by her daughter. District Detectives Jack Cassian and Darius Train join Elizabeth's sister to uncover motives entangling the wealthy and powerful with ex-convicts, deranged doctors, and crack addicts. Richard Ferrone's portentous tones set the mood for this dark story of murder, abuse, and political cover-ups. Ferrone makes the self-conscious writing sound less so, and he does wonders with the crisp exchanges between characters. His range of tones provides a softness for the female characters and a raw, rough quality that makes the worst criminals believable. Ferrone's reading makes THE BETRAYED exceptional listening.

        "When her sister is found brutally murdered, Sydney Chapin is drawn back into the vortex of her wealthy family. She's worried sick about her shy niece, Amanda, who found her mother's body, and even feels some sympathy for her steely mother, who is showing signs of vulnerability. Most of all, she wants to find out who murdered her sister and intends to fully cooperate with the two Washington, D.C., detectives assigned to the case--Darius Train, a towering former football star who grew up in one of the city's roughest sections, and his seeming polar opposite: boyish, suburban Jack Cassian. As the three work in tandem, the case leads them to a mental hospital known for its horrific eugenics experiments and then to a powerful cabinet member, all the while trying to fend off interference from wealthy, well-connected politicos. Hosp builds a fair amount of tension into his well-paced story line, but his tendency to have his characters verbally sum up key plot points and emotions seriously hinders the novel's flow. Compelling, extremely likable characters are the draw here.",
