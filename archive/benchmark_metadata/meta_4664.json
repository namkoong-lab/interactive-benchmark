        "An ideal tool for pruning tree branches up to 4 inches in diameter, cutting branches into manageable pieces, and cutting of fallen branches after storms, the Black & Decker LLP120 cordless alligator lopper provides powerful, fast cutting and its innovative clamping jaws grab and cut in one easy motion. It also includes a heavy duty cutting bar and chain to deliver fast cutting of thick branches and logs.",
        "It's powered by a 20-volt MAX lithium-ion battery that offers a longer lifespan and retains its charge 5x longer than similar 18-volt NiCad batteries--and you won't be limited by an extension cord. You'll get up to 150 cuts of 1-1/2-inch branches per charge. The battery is also designed with 50 percent less battery weight, and the unit weighs a total of 6.8 pounds with battery installed.",
        "Offering the ultimate in controlled cutting, the alligator lopper's rugged metal guards cover the jaws to protect you from the cutting chain and immediately snap back over the blades once the cut is complete. And the jaws won't skip around like chainsaws when starting to cut. The alligator lopper cuts side-to-side instead of from top-to-bottom as with traditional chainsaws--preventing burying the cutting chain in the dirt as the chain cuts though, which can quickly dull a regular chainsaw.",
        "The included Energy Star-qualified charger will charge a fully depleted battery in about 8 hours. You can also swap the battery among your other Black & Decker cordless lawn tools that are compatible with 20-volt MAX lithium-ion batteries.",
