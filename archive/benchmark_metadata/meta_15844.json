        "Small turned over collar, grommeted lacing chest, and double layer ruffled cuffs. Soft and drapey viscose rayon (a renewable resource material), looks and acts just like cotton. Washes the same and breathes wonderfully in warm weather. Because the right amount of puffiness or drape is built into the sizes already, you don't have to go beyond the size you wear in t-shirts to get the right fit. The S/M has 48\" of material in the chest, the L/XL has 56\", the 2/3X has 64\". Remember you want this to be loose and drapey, don't go by the amount of material listed, go by your normal shirt size. If you are not sure what you wear in t-shirts, this is an easy key: Short Pirates - S/M Average Height - L/XL Above Average - 2X/3X Over 6'3\" - XLT (XLT has 62\" of material in the chest but is 6 inches longer than the L/XL and so can fit up to 3XLT Pirates)."
