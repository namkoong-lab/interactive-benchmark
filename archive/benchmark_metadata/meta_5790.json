        "The new VMS Racing 50 Caliber Bullet style antenna is made of High Aircraft Quality T-6061 Billet Aluminum and Hard anodized for a long lasting finish. Unlike many competitors our antennas are made out of 100% cnc billet aluminum and not made of a cheap cast aluminum mold. Will not break or chip . The antenna has a HARD ANODIZED FINISH that will prevent the antenna from fading with time. Easy installation. Installs in minutes without special tools. Each antenna comes with a variety of adapter studs and spacers to allow for fitment on MOST vehicles with Screw in style antennas. This antenna will NOT fit any vehicle equipped with a power retractactable base for the antenna. Radio Reception Info : Like Most Aluminum short replacement antennas you may loose some radio reception. This really varies by vehicles and also depends in the area that you live. If you live in a rural area the reception might not be too good. These antennas are made of aluminum and unlike the oem antennas, they are not amplified but are a lot nicer looking. Although many customers have told us that they never had any reception issues with these we wanted to state this info for reference."
