        "7\" Hexagon Quilting template. There is a 1/4 inch seam allowance around the template and holes at the corners to easily mark the seam allowance. It is made of 1/8\" Clear Acrylic. I measure hexagons from point to point, most quilters measure a single side of the hexagon. For example the 7\" hexagon listed here has sides that are 3.5\" in length. So most quilters would call this hexagon 3.5\". These acrylic templates are cut on a laser cutter, they are new but may have minor scratches from transportation and shipping. Cutting wheel, cutting mat, and ruler not included. Words engraved on templates may vary. Template is shipped with a brown paper protective backing that can be easily peeled off. The size specified is the finished size of the shape."
