Paul does the writing with some editing from Dee. He then creates sketches after brainstorming and storyboarding the illustrations to go with the story. Once the sketches are completed, Paul does the inking of the illustrations. But the illustrations don't come to life until Dee adds the color, highlights and shadows. Once completed, Paul puts together the books in a print ready format. They also love helping others to produce their children's books. Paul and Dee hope all they do Glorifies God and brings children to the saving grace of Jesus!\"]}"
