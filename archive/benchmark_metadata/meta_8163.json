Drawn to the Big Apple by the sweet smell of wishful thinking, she studied acting on Broadway until a dark-eyed cowboy flung her over his saddle and hightailed it to the Southwest.', \"Prior to writing women's fiction, Gina always found a way to add a touch of the dramatic to her life: dinner theatre in Mississippi, can-can club in Florida, flower shop in Germany, acting school on Broadway, sweatshirt boutique on Madison Avenue, all night dive on the Lower East Side, video series in Jersey, giant Furskin in the New York Toy Fair, and plays and musicals.\", \"She's currently content to pour her melodramatic tendencies into writing sweet contemporary romance. Her alter ego, Rebecca Adler, writes the Taste of Texas cozy mystery series set in Far West Texas filled with sweet, Southern-fried flavor, delicious suspense, and scrumptious Tex-Mex recipes.\"]}"
