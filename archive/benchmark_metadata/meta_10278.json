        "Electro-dub pioneers Dreadzone formed in 1993 as ex-Big Audio Dynamite drummer Greg Roberts teamed up with Tim Bran, with the duo soon joined by bassist Leo Williams and keyboardist Dan Donovan, also formerly of Big Audio Dynamite, completing the group’s first line-up. Their second album Second Light (named by John Peel as one of his favourite albums of all time) has now been remastered at the world-famous AIR Studios."
