        "Product Description",
        "Junior Byles is one of reggae's legendary vocalists as well as being one of the biggest hit-makers for producer Lee Perry's Upsetters label. Junior scored huge hits with \"Da Da,\" \"Curly Locks\" and a host of other songs during the 1970s. This collection contains Junior Byles' biggest hits as well as a sampling of songs done throughout his years with Lee Perry. Features 22 tracks, many previously unreleased, rare, or alternate takes, including three versions of the memorable \"Curly Locks.\" Complete with rare photos, biographical notes, and extensive liner notes offering track by track information. An essential collector's item.",

        "In Byles, producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry found a vocalist that could match him in insanity, although this isn't always reflected in his hits, such as the title track (heard in three versions), and \"Beat Down Babylon,\" which were massive in Jamaica in the early seventies. But listen to the previously unissued \"Are You Leading Me On,\" in which his slow, slurred singing degenerates into mumbling over the rock steady rhythms. Aficionados might be horrified, but the kids prefer this stuff. Since the death of Haile Selassie in 1975, Byles has been a loose cannon, although he occasionally ignites recording flurries. This hits-and-sods collection also highlights Perry's Upsetters (a.k.a. the Wailers, more or less) who were the only game in town, as always.",
