        "Savannah has a history she is determined to forget. She has a career, and is living the American dream; a far cry from her childhood. As she moves beyond the sting of her past, a sequence of events that are more than just coincidence assists destiny in unveiling everything good and bad. The worst has happened when her past comes back to haunt her in more ways than one, and the best has happened—love has finally called her by name. As the truth comes to light, she struggles with the comfort of her past—Benji, due to fear of her future—Langston Carter. Past decisions lead her to her long-lost sister through the ultimate act of betrayal. Will her family be reunited in spite of it all? In the midst of all the chaos, she finds herself face-to-face with the one man who started the domino effect of negativity in her life. Nothing is coincidence in this rags-to-riches tale of karma, forgiveness and redemption with a twist of drama. Will everyone get their just desserts or will Revenge be Interrupted?"
