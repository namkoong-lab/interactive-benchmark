        "Porter's (almost famous) BOIL-THE-BAG Peanuts is a self-contained, boiled peanut kit......JUST ADD WATER! Each bag contains peanuts and a unique seasoning blend that is ready to be boiled, bag and all! This is as close to a Southern roadside stand as you'll get! Each bag arrives READY TO COOK and yields a total of 3.5 lbs. of cooked, delicious peanuts! Simply.......BOIL-THE-BAG! When we say \"Just boil the bag\", that's exactly what we mean. It's as simple as 1-2-3. Step 1: Buy the Bag Step 2: Boil the Bag (place the entire bag, unopened, into a slow cooker or stock pot) Step 3: Eat Boiled Peanuts (drain the bag, open up, and enjoy!) Tip: All good things come to those who wait! Boiled peanuts are not an instant treat. They take time. My favorite way to prepare these are to drop a bag in the slow cooker before I go to bed on Friday. By mid-morning I'm sneaking a few out the bag. When that noon game kicks off they're pretty well perfect!"
