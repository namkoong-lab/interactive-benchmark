        "NTSC/Region 0. Limited hardback book packaging includes Acoustic CD, LIVE AT PORCHESTER HALL DVD, 56 page photo book, commentary from band members and more. 2014 release, a stylistic change of pace from the Dance music production/DJ trio. In 2013, the group performed some of their best-loved songs acoustically with a 12-piece band, across three sold out shows at London's legendary Porchester Hall. With ABOVE & BEYOND ACOUSTIC, the group are putting aside their CDJs and lighting rigs to showcase their deeply-rooted musicianship and classical training. A band first and foremost, Above & Beyond are songwriters as much as they are DJs. Working with three singers, a string quartet, harpist, drummer and bassist, Above & Beyond are pushing the boundaries of EDM. Tony McGuinness sings and plays guitar, mandolin and ukulele, Paavo Siljamdki plays the grand piano and cello, and Jono Grant plays the Rhodes piano, guitar and vibraphone. ABOVE & BEYOND ACOUSTIC draws on the band's greatest tracks, across numerous single releases, two Above & Beyond artist albums, TRI-STATE (2006) and GROUP THERAPY (2011), and their Ocean lab LP SIRENS OF THE SEA."
