        "In a sleepy Italian seaport village, legend has it that a certain lady of ill repute utilized her cooking abilities to lure potential clients to her home. She would prepare a sauce of garlic, anchovies, black olives and capers in extra virgin olive oil and pear shaped tomatoes. The aroma created was so wonderfully pungent that most men could not resist the lure. The hedonistic Madame enjoyed early retirement and her recipe has become a classic still enjoyed today. She would be pleased with our rendition of her recipe."
