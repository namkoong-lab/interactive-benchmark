        "Gianfranco Rosi has emerged as one of the most awarded and provocative documentarians working today. His observational films artfully and sympathetically depict the lives of subcultures and displaced peoples the world over. The Gianfranco Rosi Collection includes four of his greatest films. Fire at Sea (2016), an Academy Award® Nominee for Best Documentary Feature and winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, is a heartwrenching portrait of African refugees pouring into the Italian island of Lampedusa. Sacro GRA (2013), winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, is an engaging tour of Rome s ring road, populated by a fascinating group of eccentrics. Rosi spent five years shooting Below Sea Level (2008), which documents the hand-to-mouth existence of California flatland squatters. And his first feature, Boatman (1993), captures life and death on the Ganges River in India. Special Features: Booklet essay by Nicolas Rapold, Interview with Gianfranco Rosi (Disc 1), Interview with Pietro Bartolo (Disc 1), NYFF: Q&A with Gianfranco Rosi (Disc 1, courtesy of Film Society of Lincoln Center), Trailers"
