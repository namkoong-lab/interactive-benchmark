        "From the Author",
        "This is a standalone book in the Dragongrove series. The main characters, Maggie and Caelian, are introduced in Dragongrove: Mated to the Dragon King, but their story really takes shape in this book. I would consider this more like a spin-off expanding on the relationship between this couple that can be fully enjoyed by itself."
