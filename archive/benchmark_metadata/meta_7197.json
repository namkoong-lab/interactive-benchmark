        "Three Historic western romance novellas set in the 1870 to 1910 timeframe in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Previously published as individual titles on Amazon.Will Carrington is a man of conviction. That conviction may lead to a battle he’s not prepared to win. Many in Texas believed he’d follow in his father’s footsteps by taking the helm of the Carrington Ranch, but wanderlust sent him far away from the life he knew and the life he’d someday wish he could get back.The Hansen girls built a reputation on being strong-willed and stubborn… none more so than eldest daughter Mattie, a fiery redhead with a temper to match. She spent her whole life making up for not being born a male. Now a lifetime of penance has led her to a laundry list of aggravation as her mother plays unsolicited matchmaker with her and the reluctant Carrington boy.Their futures on the line, will the stubborn heir apparent and the fiercely independent redhead give in to their mutual attraction or will their argumentative nature ruin any hopes of romance for them?"

        "From the Author",
        "The story behind The Redheads and the Cowboys.The complete texts of the three books from myRedheads and the Cowboys series are contained here. They are standalone and canbe read in any order.All three of the romances are clean and thebedroom doors are kept firmly closed. There is no profanity.Big Jake, starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Harais one of my favorite movies. I have watched it over and over and enjoy itevery time. John Wayne is Jacob McCandles and Maureen is his wife, Martha. Themovie begins with a raid on the McCandles ranch led by John Fain, played in themovie by Richard Boone. After the raid, Martha sends for Jacob who has beengone for years.I began to wonder where he had been and why, so Iwrote what I thought might have happened as Book 1. The movie covered themiddle, so I created a life for them, after the end of the movie as Book 2.Book 3 is the story of their son, played by JohnWayne's real life son, Patrick Wayne and his life and love.In the books Will Carrington is similar to the role of Jacob, played by John Wayne in the movie. Mattie Carrington is patterned after the Maureen O'Hara role.Did I mention I love all things John Wayne?"
