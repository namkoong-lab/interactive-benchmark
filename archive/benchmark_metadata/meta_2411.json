        "What is this book about?",
        "The Women in His Life: What Jesus Saw in Them",
        "gives the reader a peek into the mind of Jesus through the creative expression of the author as she imagines his relationships with the women of the New Testament.The reader will discover a collection of forty-three stories about women in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Each story begins with a verse or verses from the New Testament, followed by the words the author imagines Jesus would have spoken to express his thoughts and feelings about the women he interacted with or heard about during his life. The author has given a name to some of the women who otherwise are nameless in the gospels. She has used modern vernacular to enable the reader to imagine how Jesus might have told these stories today.Against the historical, cultural, and religious backdrop of the restricted public role of women in the first century, Jesus comes through as a man who honored, appreciated, and respected the true value, importance and needs of women. He enjoyed their company and celebrated with them. He was gentle, playful, and challenging. He treated women as equals. He honored their natural gifts and disregarded the societal conventions that forbade him from interacting with them. Speaking and listening to women directly, he looked into the hearts of all he encountered with compassion and love as he ministered to them. He drew from them their opinions and ideas and they responded to him with love, loyalty, and respect. He was a Zealot who also was tender and caring.",
        "Who will this book appeal to?",

        "About the Author",
        "The roots of my spiritual writing began when I spent seven years living a monastic life in a Trappist religious order in the 1970s. After retiring from a career as a grant writer, I returned to a daily practice of spiritual reading and writing, and The Women in His Life was born. It is my hope that these Gospel-based stories will benefit readers who are searching for a more personal experience of the central figure of the New Testament. The book is unique because these narratives are written from what I imagine to be the thoughts, words, and feelings of Jesus in each situation. I've tried to capture the individuality of forty-three women as Jesus interacted with them or reflected upon their lives. It is my wish that the reader's spiritual journey will be richer after meditating upon these stories. Christian believers will discover the deep appreciation Jesus has for women of all ages and situations in life. I'm a Pennsylvania native and I've lived in Florida since the mid-1980s where I raised my son. In addition to writing, I enjoy traveling, photography, family, Reiki, and being with friends.
