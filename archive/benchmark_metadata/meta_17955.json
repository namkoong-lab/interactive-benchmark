Its patented design allows the Storm whistle to be heard up to fifty feet underwater, due to its unique sounding chamber forcing out all water when the whistle is blown. Made in the USA. It's perfect for divers, lifeguards, and for recreation! Creates a clear, high frequency sound, with a power rating over 75% greater than other referee and safety whistles. A Whistle defense program is a tremendous way to safely empower students against crime. The Storm Whistle is easy to hold, easy to see and incredibly loud. Invented by Dr. Howard Wright in 1988, the Storm Safety Whistle has saved over a dozen lives with its piercing, 130 decibel sound. Proudly made in the USA."
