        "Nothing improves the looks of a vehicle quicker than bolting on an oversize wheel & tire combination. Unfortunately, this can leave parts of your truck’s body exposed to potential damage from road hazards, not to mention putting you in violation of the law in many states. Bushwacker Extend-A-Fender Flares are the ideal solution for adding a little extra coverage for those larger tires, without the bulky look of an off-road style flare. Precision designed to install in just minutes and built to stand the test of time, with durable Dura-Flex 2000 ABS construction. They are flexible, UV-resistant and impervious to impacts for a lifetime of worry-free use. Did we mention how great they look? ."
