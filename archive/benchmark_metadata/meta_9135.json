Almost from the moment I wake up in the morning, my mind is bubbling over with ideas about what I am going to cook for today. I also love sharing about the things I prepare, which is why I started my food blog way back in the early days of blogging. Its gone through several changes throughout the years, evolving eventually into the blog which I keep up today, entitled simply \"The English Kitchen\". I only ever very rarely miss a day of sharing. I am often asked how can I do this every single day, and my answer is quite simple. I eat every day, so why not share it? I grew up in Canada, and have been a foodie all of my life. I can remember clipping recipes out of my mother\\'s magazines as a young girl, and gluing them into a binder, which I still have. My Big Blue Binder has followed me literally around the world, and is like a history of my culinary journey, containing a multitude of tasty gems, my tried and trues, gleaned from my travels, family and the many friends I have made throughout my life. I have always been a keen and capable cook, so when I found myself divorced in my 40\\'s, I decided to go back to school and became a Chef. I worked for many years in the UK, as a personal Chef. It was a demanding job, but one which I was good at, and which really enjoyed. I have retired now back to Canada where I spend my days cooking for my family and friends, and the blog of course, drawing and painting, practicing the needlearts, and writing. I love dolls, polka dots and tea cups, but most of all I love sharing. You can read my daily posts at https://theenglishkitchen.blogspot.com']}"
