        "SPECIAL COLOR EDITION",
        "Green ants that defend their tree by attacking anyone who touches it...a mysterious lava-tube cave with hikers' flashlights floating like fireflies down into its blackness...fruit bats noisily lobbing mangos onto your cabin's tin roof. The beauties -- and dangers -- of the crocodile-infested Kakadu National Park. A crash landing at a remote island airstrip...a rugby match in Northern Territory (and why Aussie girls never \"root\" for their teams).",
        "In this",
        "colorful and remarkable book",
        ", written by a colorful and remarkable woman pilot, you'll find the most enjoyable way to discover Australia -- by flying a light airplane to its places of greatest interest while watching the exotic landscape unroll beneath you. Vistas of giant paisley patterned earth, caused by underlying salt strata. Stunning views of red landscapes, uplifted and contorted during the earth's primordial boil. The enormously long white beaches of Western Australia, lonesome and edged by brilliant aquas. And the Indian Ocean to the south, marked by hundreds of miles of cliffs. Whales breed there...You could get lucky. You don't have to be a pilot to enjoy this book. The author wrote it also for non-flyers, in non-technical terms, to let you",
        "see amazing things that pilots experience",
        "from their very special perspective. You'll want to read it, re-read it, and share it with your friends.",

        "Review",
        "\"Michelee Cabot's",
        "Fly Over Down Under",
        ", describing how she and husband Hal circumnavigated the entire continent of Australia, hit the interest jackpot. Michelee is a gifted writer. I vicariously enjoyed her adventure Down Under. I learned a great deal about people, places, history, all the basic ingredients that comprise a typical travel book. What sets this one apart is a",
        "spritely sense of humor, her profound passion, and her knowledge about airplane piloting",
        ", a world I never experienced.\"--",
        "Earle Winderman, PhD, Lincoln University, Comparative Literature",
        "\"Michelee grew up an Air Force brat, living all over the world - Philippines, Japan, Europe, and numerous US bases. It was perhaps only natural that she would someday embrace aviation and fall in love with the sky. She writes with a",
        "breezy, casual style",
        "that encourages you to read the next chapter and the one after that, with engaging descriptions of the people and places that give Australia a certain mystical sense of adventure.\"-",
        "Bill Cox, senior editor Plane&Pilot Magazine",
        "\"I very much enjoyed reading Michelee's book about flying all over Down Under. Michelee has a",
        "very lively style",
        "that makes people, situations, and even landscapes come alive.\"--",
        "Walter Hoebling, published poet, Professor, University of Graz, Austria",

        "Fly Over Down Under",
        "is a",
        "truly modern-day adventure",
        "that most of us will never experience. Michelee Cabot tells the tale of their trip with a great sense of humor, an astounding vocabulary, and with a wonderful study of the history of each aspect of their air-minded route. Very enjoyable and enlightening.\"--",
        "Willis Allen, President Allen Airways Flying Museum and Crystal Pier Hotel and Cottages, Inc., San Diego",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "\"As one who has always wanted to see all of the various, and dramatically different, areas of Australia for many years, I was able to take such a trip while reading Michelee's Fly Over Down Under. Plus in later years, after becoming a pilot, it made the book even more interesting due to just enough of the pilot's jargon and experiences while on this 'flying trip' to make the reading experience twice as delightful. Never did the 'read' lag due to a",
        "good dose of humor",
        "mixed with an ever-changing view of Australia.\"--",

        "About the Author",
        "Born a Texan to a career Air Force officer and very Southern mother, Michelee spent her impressionable early years all around the world, on a path that brought her to a first marriage at twenty-one. Two children later, with useful time served volunteering at hospitals and museums, she found her way to her first flight lesson. Flying can be liberating... In the ensuing nearly fifty years, besides becoming a C.A.S.A. volunteer, she found her excellent new husband Hal, became a restaurant reviewer, managed a flight school office and logged more than 5,000 hours of flight time, including these in Australia. She holds a commercial license (both single engine land and glider) with instrument rating, and a tow pilot endorsement, and has been active in several aviation organizations, including the volunteer Airlifeline (now Angel Flight).Michelee has been married to her second husband, Harold Cabot, for more than 45 years, and is the mother of two super children and three charming step-children. Her extended modern family includes a delightful array of daughters- and sons-in-law and clever, beautiful \"grands'\"and \"great-grands\" that give her much pleasure. She has lived in Alamos, Mexico, with her husband Hal and their Cessna P210 for twelve years. When recently sitting on an aviation conference panel in Mumbai - a celebration of 100 years of India's Civil Aviation - someone asked \"After all these years, why do you still fly?\" The audience of pilots and controllers became a moving sea of nodding heads at her smiling answer - \"Because I still need the overview.\" And she still flies today - she and her husband through the years have become a smoothly-tooled combo in the cockpit, and as in this Australian adventure, they are still swapping legs - and still loving the overview.Find out more at: micheleecabot.com",
