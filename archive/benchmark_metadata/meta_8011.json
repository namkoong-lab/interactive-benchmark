        "Pack your CarryAlong Play Book and come camping with Mickey and Friends!",
        "After Minnie tells a spooky story around the campfire, Donald and Mickey are left shaking in their sleeping bags! When a mysterious growling roars through the campsite, the two friends go hunting for the source of the sound, afraid that there’s a beast on the loose. Lift-the-flaps, pull-outs, and a sturdy CarryAlong handle make it so you can be a part of the story wherever you go!"

        "is originally from Oregon, but now lives in Seattle, Washington, after receiving her B.A. in English from Gonzaga University. The daughter of a children’s librarian, Maggie has grown up surrounded by books and feels impossibly lucky to write and edit books for kids. She spends her time trying not to get worried about the increasing number of crows in her backyard, petting her enormous cat, Finch, and drinking more coffee than is probably healthy."

As the daughter of a children’s librarian, she has a special place in her heart for all books, but especially books for children. From co-writing the award-winning board book series Wild Bios to developing personalities for 180 quirky cats for Hasbro’s Lost Kitties, Maggie is no stranger to creating licensed and original content that is fun, funny, and informative. She has written books for Nickelodeon, Disney, Mattel, Dreamworks, Smithsonian, and Discovery, and has experience with an array of novelty formats. Whether she is delving into a world of her own creation or breathing life into existing characters, Maggie is most at home with a pen in her hand (or, her fingers on the keyboard!).']}"
