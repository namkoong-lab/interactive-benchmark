        "HOW EASILY ONE'S HEART CAN BE STOLEN, DEPENDS UPON THE THIEF...In The Highwayman, Independent Publishers Gold medal winning author Judith James takes readers on a thrilling ride from the privileged world of London’s aristocracy to the highways and byways, inns and hunting grounds of some of England’s most celebrated rogues. Rich with history and sizzling with passion, this is another love story you won’t forget. England 1680 Known to some as Gentleman Jack and others as Swift Nick, Jack Nevison preys on the wealthy, stealing coin (and the occasional kiss) on England's darkest roads. Jack's dangerous deeds are legend, but the thrill of a highwayman's life is growing cold—until he meets the intrepid travel writer and spinster, Arabella Hamilton. Beautiful and bold, Arabella may come from the world Jack despises, but she's a kindred spirit at heart. When circumstances bring them together the sparks ignite—yet they remain on opposite sides of society and the law and with each encounter they risk more. To be together, will one of them have to give up their world forever?Although The Highwayman is a work of fiction, by all accounts Swift Nick was the real deal. A clever, gallant, gentleman highwayman described as tall, good-humored, handsome and generous - who avoided using violence, a notable rarity at the time. A popular hero in his day, he was a favorite subject of broadsheets and chapbooks. Escape artist, Robin Hood, and handsome dare-devil – it was he, not Dick Turpin, who made the legendary ride to York. His adventures are chronicled in The Newgate Calander, and they and the mystery surrounding his death feature prominently here.The character of Arabella Hamilton is based on the 17th century travel writer and journalist, Celia Fiennes. The quotes, journal entries (and spelling) at the head of some chapters and in the text are hers. Thought by some to be the fine lady upon a white horse at Banbury Cross, where they do lay claim to her, she was a remarkable woman for her, or any time. Celia was an excellent horsewoman and an intrepid traveler, braving danger and describing her journey with breathless enthusiasm as she visited every county in England, sometimes with only one servant, in a time when travel could literally kill you, and highwaymen ruled the roads.Although she was of good family, and is variously described as humorous, outgoing and intelligent, she never married, which comes as no surprise. It would take an adventurous and open-minded man not to stifle such an unusual and independent woman. But what if on her travels she had met a handsome highwayman, with a soul as adventurous as her own?What if, is one of my favorite questions. It is the place where fact and fiction intertwine and stories are born."
