        "An earthy tale of country loving in 1870s England; Bathsheba Everdene is that unusual combination - a beautiful young woman who is also mistress of her own farm. Proposals of marriage are not long in coming, but with her lack of experience in judging men, how can she possibly choose between the solid young shepherd Gabriel Oak, the dignified squire Farmer Boldwood, or the dashing sergeant of Hussars, Francis Troy?Now with added explicit scenes of seduction, shameless pursuit, and solitary frustration - as we follow Bathsheba’s initiation into physical love.Sensuality Level: Sensual"
