        "Americana Global Exact Fit Compression Pads The Americana EFC foam pad was designed and manufactured right here in the United States. These pads can really go the distance saving you time and money in your business. All of our products were created by detailers for detailers because your success is important to us. We are familiar with the day in and day out struggles of paint correction. The Americana EFC foam pad is our answer to more efficient and effective paint correction. There are a few key attributes which set us apart -Exact Fit Design (The backing plate matches up perfectly with the edges of the pad) -Signature Ventilation Holes The pores of the pad by design resist buffing liquid building up during correction -No De-lamination and No Glue failure Designed to be durable and long lasting when used with Long throw DA machines The exact fit design pad means our pad pairs up perfectly with the actual size of your backing plate so you don't have to guess which pad fits on which backing plate. Why is EXACT FIT important? When Pad overage or excess foam hangs outside the parameter of your backing plate it causes two problems First, the backing plate digs into the edge of the pad and begins to break down the edges of the pad over time. (Tearing itself apart) Second, when the edge of the pad is broken down it will cause de-lamination and glue issues of the hook and loop from the foam pad. The EFC Pad aligns perfectly with the backing plate of the Rupes machines and thus the edges of the pad will not be damaged by your machine. The exact fit design also allows for more consistent and even pressure of the pad to the paint surfaces. Even and consistent surface pressures equates to more correction power. This also allows the machine to run more smooth by eliminating additional drag. Next you will notice 6 ventilation holes built into the pad which conveniently align with the Rupes backing plates."
