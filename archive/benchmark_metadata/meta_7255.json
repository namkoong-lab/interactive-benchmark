        "Meet Gideon, the newest addition to Olivier Dunrea’s gaggle of adorable goslings! Gideon likes to splash with the ducklings, hop with the frogs, play chase-the-piglets, and scamper all over the farmyard. But one thing busy Gideon does not want to do is take his nap, no matter how many times his mother asks . . . until he gets tired, of course.",
        "Another darling gosling makes his debut in this spunky story, with Olivier Dunrea’s perfectly pitched storytelling and illustrations that Gossie & Friends fans have come to cherish."
