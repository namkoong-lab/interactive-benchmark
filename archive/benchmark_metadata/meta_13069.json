        "Bates 1766 Women� s Black 6-Inch Steel Toe DuraShocks Work Boots have been approved for use by the US Navy. That means they meet all of the demanding qualifications, including ASTM certified steel toes. They feature great-looking full grain leather uppers, so even if you� re not in the Navy, you'll want to wear them for work or on the weekends.Consider the long, hard days that military personnel put in and you know that these boots will be able to stand up to the worksites you face every day. The DuraShocks comfort technology includes compression pads located in the heel and forefoot of the outsole that dissipate striking force as you move. The closed-cell polyurethane footbeds will not lose their bounce, they spring back to give your feet and legs extra energy. Vibram Extreme rubber outsoles are the finishing touch on Bates 1766 Women� s Black 6-Inch Steel Toe DuraShocks Work Boots. Bates boots are slip-resistant and will keep you stable, even on ship decks, where stability really counts. They're assembled in the USA."
