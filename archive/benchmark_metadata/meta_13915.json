        "Archangel Michael leads his angels against the dragon (\"the Devil and Satan\") and his angels during the war in heaven, where he defeats the dragon. In the Epistle of Jude, Michael is specifically referred to as \"the archangel Michael\". Sanctuaries to Michael were built by Christians in the 4th century, when he was first seen as a healing angel. Over time his role became one of a protector and the leader of the heavenly host against the forces of evil.",
        "Archangel Michael first role is the leader of the Army of God and the leader of heaven's forces in their triumph over the powers of hell. He is viewed as the angelic model for the virtues of the spiritual warrior, with the conflict against evil at times viewed as the battle within.",
        "In his second role, Michael is the angel of death, carrying the souls of all the deceased to heaven. In this role Michael descends at the hour of death, and gives each soul the chance to redeem itself before passing; thus consternating the devil and his minions. In his third role, he weighs souls on his perfectly balanced scales. For this reason, Michael is often depicted holding scales.",
        "In his fourth role, Saint Michael, the special patron of the Chosen People in the Old Testament, is also the guardian of the Church. Saint Michael was revered by the military orders of knights during the Middle Ages. This role also was why he was considered the patron saint of a number of cities and countries. Christian amulet is a talisman charm often inscribed with a magic incantation, prayer or symbol to protect the wearer against evil (as disease or witchcraft) and to aid."
