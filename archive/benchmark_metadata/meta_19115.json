    "description": [
        "***Rolled up for packaging*** Polycarbonate sheet combines high impact and temperature resistance with optical clarity and can be utilized for secondary glazing behind existing glazing for economical protection against breakage or intrusion. Polycarbonate sheet can be cut, sawn, drilled and milled by using standard workshop equipment without the risk of cracking and breakage and is therefore an excellent candidate for fabricating a wide range of indoor applications such as machine guards etc. Polycarbonate sheet can be easily thermoformed into complex parts while retaining its excellent properties necessary for demanding applications such as vandal proof street furniture. Polycarbonate sheet may be decorated using a wide variety of modern techniques such as painting and screen printing. Unlike most thermoplastics, polycarbonate can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can be processed and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as forming bends on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, no heating is generally necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal Light transmission Transparent Polycarbonate sheet have excellent light transmission, dependent of thickness between 84 - 87%. Fire performance Polycarbonate sheet has good fire behavior characteristics. Lexan sheet does not contribute significantly to the spread of fire or to the generation of toxic gases.
