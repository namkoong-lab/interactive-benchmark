        "From the Author",
        "This was the first book I did from one of my screenplays. I loved writing this book because it was a labor of love. I volunteered at a community center for challenged children to be able to understand why Elaine Lewis, the main character of this book, had a secret that she refused to discuss or share with her husband or best friend.  This is a stand alone book but it has a very interesting story and the appeal is broad. Elaine is a woman that anyone can identify with because almost everyone has private feelings and parts of their life that they don't feel comfortable sharing.",
