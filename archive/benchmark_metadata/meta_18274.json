        "For 45 years, Mongoose has been in the dirt, down the trails, and on the ramps. Founded in 1974 in a Southern California garage, Mongoose was born from BMX Racing with products that push the limits of what a rider can do on the track. Our latest line of BMX race bikes, the title series, have been designed using that same race pedigree. Designed for beginner-level riders, the Mongoose Title Micro gives you a trophy-worthy bike at an amazingly affordable price! The title features a lightweight Tectonic T1 aluminum frame (16. 50” top tube), integrated headset, and internal cable routing for clean lines and added protection. The title hi-ten steel 2-inch rise handlebar and 30mm stem are designed for precision riding, while the strong Exposure double-wall alloy rims and Arisen XLR8 BMX race tires add crucial durability without weighing you down. The 39x16t gearing with two-piece tubular chromo 130-millimeter cranks, and Euro cartridge bottom bracket offer a high-quality drivetrain capable of winning speeds. Aluminum linear pull bikes with aluminum brake levers provide speed control, while the hi-ten BMX fork with 1-1/8\" Thread less steered and taper leg helps maximize performance. This bike ships ready to be assembled and comes with a 5-year limited on the frame and a 1-year limited on parts."
