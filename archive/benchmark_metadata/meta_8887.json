        "The Seven Thunders of God opens the secrets of the book of Revelation by giving the reader ears to hear the types and shadows hidden for generations and now being made manifest to His holy apostles. To aid the reader with these symbols and types a twenty page dictionary is included. This dictionary gives the scriptural foundations for all the types found in Revelation. The book of Revelation has been reserved for an end-time generation of apostles and prophets but to understand it we must first speak in the language that has veiled all previous studies. According to Revelation 1:3 all who read, understand and keep this prophecy will be blessed. Open this book and become part of the revelation of Christ that has already blessed so many."
