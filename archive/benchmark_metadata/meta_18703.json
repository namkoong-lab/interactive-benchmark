Sweet almond oil is blended with extract of fragile blackthorn blossom to create a delicate, quickly-absorbed layer that cushions against irritation and reduces sensitivity. This gently nourishing and soothing treatment can be used as pampering care, for occasional protection in cold weather, or even to remove eye make-up. Experience a complete regimen. Lavish sensitive, dry skin with comforting almond oil. This regimen is complete with a mild cleanser, a depuffing eye cream, a daily moisturizer, a gently hydrating treatment and a protective facial balm. Weleda personal care products are dermatologically tested with no synthetic fragrances, colors, preservatives and raw materials derived from mineral oils and never tested on animals. In Switzerland 1921, Weleda was founded on the belief that people are part of nature, grounded in a commitment to carefully orchestrate formulas that work with the body’s rhythms to awaken skin’s natural functions. Weleda is still creating those products today, that recognize the power of the natural world to balance mind, body and spirit allowing your beauty to shine through."
