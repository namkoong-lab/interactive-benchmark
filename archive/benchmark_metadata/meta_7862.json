        "Albert lies in bed one night. Goose bumps cover his hairy little arms. His fangs chatter with fright. Albert is sure there's a scary little girl lurking in his closet. He's convinced there's a mean little boy hiding under his bed. But when Albert's mom tells him again that little boys and girls don't exist, he's on his own to get rid of them once and for all!",

        "reS-K-This story puts a spin on Mercer Mayer's There's a Nightmare in My Closet (Turtleback, 1968) and James Howe's There's a Monster under My Bed (Atheneum, 1986). Albert, a monster, is terrified of little boys and girls. He knows they lurk in his closet and under his bed, waiting to eat him up. His mother tells him that there are no such phenomena, but this does nothing to alleviate his fears. Finally, with pounding heart, Albert confronts the demons so that he can sleep. Unfortunately, this silly story lacks charm. Baker gives too many plot details that negate any element of fear (a boy playing \"piggie\" with the monster's toes is not scary). Hayes's colorful artwork is clever, adding details of a bone for a curtain rod and a monster portrait on the wall, but too busy, thus detracting from the story. Telling a tale from the monster's point of view is an enticing concept, but it has been done more creatively in Philippe Corentin's Papa! (Chronicle, 1997) and Jackie French Koller's No Such Thing (Boyds Mills, 1997).",
