        "From the Back Cover",
        "GWM roommate wanted. When apartment-hunting Frankie Zito reads the classified ad, he doesn't know GWM means Gay White Male. He figures it means Guy With Money--and he's sure he'll soon have enough cash to qualify. With plenty of laughs and good-hearted exuberance, Kiss Me Guido puts lifestyles on a comic collision course. One hillarious mix-up follows another as straight-arrow Frankie (Nick Scotti), a pizza maker from the Bronx, comes to terms with Greenwich Village gay culture...and his new roomie, actor/choreographer Warren (Anthony Barrile), comes to terms with Frankie."
