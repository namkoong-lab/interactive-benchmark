        "Review",
        "\"...A perfect period puzzler, Madame Koska and the Imperial Brooch is clever, concise, occasionally comical...\" Jay Strafford, books editor, Richmond Times-Dispatch  \"Agatha Christie reborn. A veritable tour de force of the twenties' London fashion scene with our heroine the Madame (if one may use the word in this sense) of an up and coming atelier. We meet Russian émigrés down on their luck and have a stolen brooch being sought by the thieves who hid it too well. Ilil Arbel has adopted the mantle of the Grande Dame of this age and produced a stunning book full of fun and the obligatory twisted ending. Don't miss it!\" Lord David Prosser, author of the Barsetshire Diaries",

        "\"...I didn't know whodunit until the very last few pages.\" Wayne Zurl, author of the Sam Jenkins Murder Mysteries Series",
