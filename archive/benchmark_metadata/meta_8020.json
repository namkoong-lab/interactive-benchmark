        "Go for the goodnight kiss: How to close the interview strong",
        "The close of an interview is a lot like the end of a date. In both cases, you're nervous, anxious, and asking yourself whether the person you're with wants to give you a goodnight kiss or the awkward and always disappointing \"let's be friends\" hug. Although you'll never, and I repeat never, actually go for a goodnight kiss at the end of an interview, there are some things you can do to seal the deal.",
        "Reaffirm your interest in the position",
        "(the dating equivalent of \"call me\"). Doing so lets the interviewer know that you're still very much interested in the job. Start by highlighting two to three reasons why you're the right candidate. Also be sure to repeat why you're interested in working for that particular company; what makes them uniquely different? Saying you want to work for them because they're an industry leader isn't enough; there could be a different industry leader tomorrow. Although your answer will vary for each company, people and corporate culture might be at the top of the list.",
        "Ask about next steps in the interview process",
        "(the dating equivalent of \"Will I see you again?\"). Knowing when the company plans to notify candidates of whether or not they made it to the next round of interviews can be incredibly valuable. Not only does it help ease some of your anxiety so you're not waiting by the phone for weeks on end, but the timeframe is also something you can refer to if you decide to follow up if you haven't heard from the company.  In addition to closing strong, you'll also want to spend some time shortly after your interview to reflect on how you thought everything went. Even though analyzing your interview performance can be just as stressful as a sleepless night wondering if the person you went on a date with earlier that night likes you as much as you like him or her, it's something you must to do if you want to improve your interview skills. Don't agonize over every sentence you uttered during the interview. Instead, assess the interview calmly and rationally. Reflecting on your interview while it's fresh in your mind helps you identify the things you think you did well and the things you might need to work on before your next interview. And it will also help you write your personalized thank-you note to show the interviewer you appreciated his or her time.",
