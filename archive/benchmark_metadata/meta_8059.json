Readers will delight in being able to follow the lives of the characters such as Ty, the sympathetic shaman of his Community, who falls in love with Aine, from the broader multicultural Australian community found in the cities, who becomes his spiritual partner and who in turn is immersed in this unique Aboriginal culture.

It was great to learn more about aboriginal customs and their way of living. I look forward to the next chapter. It made me feel like I should go out and explore the outback and all the mysteries to be found out there."
