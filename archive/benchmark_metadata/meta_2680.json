        "At the age of 22, Bowers was thrown the biggest curveball of his life. He was forced to choose which path he was going to take: continue the cycle of family poverty or break it. The Mindset is an inspirational memoir of Ace Bowers’ personal transformation from janitor to millionaire. Bowers began his journey uneducated, overweight, addicted to cigarettes, in debt, and depressed. Revealing the skeletons in his closet for the first time set the scene for how he got to the point of cleaning a motel for $6 an hour. Bowers’ detailed accounts of his turbulent and traumatizing childhood illustrated what it is like growing up in a poor, alcoholic, and abusive family. The metamorphosis began as soon as he changed his mindset. Within five years, Bowers was able to completely turn his life around, going from trash to technology. This memoir illuminates step by step his unconventional path to wealth, health, and happiness."

        "Review",
        "\"This debut memoir presents a modern-day, rags-to-riches story that articulates the concepts employed by the author to overcome his personal demons. The captivating book's simple, straightforward prose effectively communicates the turmoil of young Bowers' life, the valuable steps he took to shed his glass-half-empty mindset, and the worthy lessons he learned along the way. Initially crafting this memoir to 'vent' and 'fan the flames of frustration' he felt toward his parents, the author skillfully expanded his mission: 'Now I know I am writing it to release everything I've pent up within me, and to hopefully help others in the process.' An intriguing account that shows readers how to use life's difficulties to turn a negative self-image into a positive, goal-oriented one.\"",

        "\"I did not find anything I did not like about this book. If a reader is on the hunt for a quick dose of inspiration, then this is the one for you. Because the writing revolves around the author's late teens and twenties, young adults might find this book appealing. More mature readers may also find enlightenment in its pages which contain profound wisdom.  I am awarding this a 4 out of 4 stars for its high-quality writing and valuable lesson sharing. This book has great potential to help those who may be struggling with the same issues that the author has overcome. By the end of the book, I found myself thinking that this is only the beginning for this writer. He has so much experience to share in the world of finances, family dysfunction and healing from emotional wounds of the past.\" -",
