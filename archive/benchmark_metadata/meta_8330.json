        "Child Development: Perspectives in Developmental Psychology",
        "is a new topical introduction to child development, focusing on the psychological development of infants and children, with some treatment of adolescents. Written by Canadian professor M.D. Rutherford, the text covers all of the classic areas of developmental psychology, including a historical look at developmental psychology, important theories and methods (past and present), perceptual development, cognitive development, language development, moral development, and social development. In addition, the text provides a comprehensive introduction that places a greater emphasis, although not an exclusive one, on evolutionary perspectives, drawing parallels and contrasts with an evolutionary perspective on developmental psychology, highlighting research that is consistent with what is known about evolution by natural selection. Unique to this text is a critical discussion deconstructing the 'nature versus nurture' question in developmental psychology. Although the question is a classic question, dating back to the earliest writings about human development, our current thinking about development makes the 'nature versus nurture' question unanswerable: nature and nurture necessarily work together in development. As M.D. Rutherford states, 'Without genes there is nothing that develops, and without the necessary environmental input, there is nothing that develops; every person and every trait of every person is a result of a genetic and environmental interaction'."

        "Review",
        "\"I view this textbook as better than the competitors. I'm excited about the overall organization and treatment. . . . The author raises studies, research, points with a reason-the book takes research seriously. One advantage of the book is that it is completely unlike any other introductory book for developmental psychology.\" ―Ori Friedman, University of Waterloo\"Child Development: Perspectives in Developmental Psychology discusses the most recent research on cognitive, social, and gender development and makes it clear that the current state of developmental psychology is no longer whether some ability is shaped by nature or nurture, but rather how it is shaped jointly by both . . . I am really excited about this textbook.\" ―FangFang Li, University of Lethbridge",
