        "The Day Bob Saw Jesus by Lindi Juarez ★★★★★         BY  R.C. GIBSON / JANUARY 27, 2021 A stirring and emotional picture book that highlights the value of prayer.At school, Bob is a self-proclaimed bully who picks on his fellow second-grade classmates, pulling their hair, tripping them, shoving them, and the like. He takes pride in his punishments and is never helpful or friendly. His teacher, Mrs. Rose, is a Christian with a love for Jesus and for her students, and she prays for Bob. The next morning, Bob has a vision of Jesus at his school, lovingly watching all the students and their actions toward each other. As Bob observes how Jesus treats the students kindly and lovingly, Bob's heart is touched and filled with grace and he begins a transformation that will change his very life course.Every school has students like Bob. And whether it is patient and caring teachers or fellow students, every school has Christians that are praying for misguided children. The Day Bob Saw Jesus is a stirring and emotional picture book that highlights the value of prayer, forgiveness, and the love of the Christ. The full-page artwork is exquisite, not overshadowing the book's powerful message, but instead enhancing it and making it more attractive to youths. This book teaches young ones valuable Christian qualities, and it can also strengthen their faith and fill them with hope. Lindi Juarez shows that she knows her audience well and has great respect and faith while looking to share the gospel with youths in a warm manner that will undoubtedly touch their hearts.",
