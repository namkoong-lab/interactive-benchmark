        "Anthony, a banking executive, and Naomi, a dentist, are two people who have trusted their jobs and status to make them whole--until they are suddenly without either. Against the backdrop of San Francisco and plans for a California wedding for Mary and Moor (from Ain't No Mountain), Ain't No Valley is the story of two people in crisis, learning to glean the very best from life; two people who have squandered their God-given gifts on a world that has used them up, and who now search to find their way home."

        ", Foster pens a sassy tale full of African-American slang. This time, the story line revolves around Mary and Moor's California wedding and two of their friends, the newly unemployed Anthony and Naomi. Anthony rather improbably wanders to Napa Valley in search of Sly (\"and the Family\") Stone's brother Freddy, hoping to indulge a teen fantasy by finding the rock star. Equally improbably, Naomi hits the jackpot on",

        ", but her absence from work results in her losing her job. While she waits to collect her game show money, she meets Ruthie, a teenage waif who teaches her how to \"glean\" food for free (vague echoes of the biblical story of Ruth and Naomi). Meanwhile, Foster brings readers up to speed on earlier series characters in Maryland and North Carolina as they make their plans to attend the wedding. Too many characters, places, points of view and plot lines confuse, but Foster somehow glues everything together. Readers will get tired of hearing about Thelma's blue eyes, and Foster can't resist sermonizing toward the end, but there's plenty of fun to be had. Foster's fans should embrace her latest.",
