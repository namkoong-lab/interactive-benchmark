        "The Man with the Golden Arm – Digitally Remastered The Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American drama about a strung-out junkie who deals with his demoralizing drug addiction while his crippled wife and card sharks keep dragging him down. It stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker and Kim Novak (Vertigo). Based on the novel by Nelson Algren, the film features Frank Sinatra as Frankie Machine, expert card dealer. Recently released from prison, Frankie is determined to set his life in order -- and that means divesting himself of his heroin habit. He dreams of becoming a jazz drummer but his greedy wife, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), wants him to continue his lucrative gambling activities. Since Zosch is confined to a wheelchair as a result of a car accident caused by Frankie, he's in no position to refuse. Frankie’s wife is not actually crippled -- she is faking her invalid status to keep Frankie under her thumb. Meanwhile, a gambling boss played by Robert Strauss wants Frankie to deal at a high-stakes poker game; terrified that he's lost his touch, Frankie asks a dope pusher (Darren McGavin) to supply him with narcotics. When the drug dealer discovers that Zosch is not an invalid she kills him and Frankie is accused of the murder. He is willing to go to the cops but he doesn't want to show up with drugs in his system. So with the help of the sympathetic Molly (Kim Novak), Frankie locks himself up and goes \"cold turkey\" in a harrowing sequence. After Zosch kills herself in a suicidal fall, the path is cleared for Frankie to pursue a clean new life with Molly. Controversial in its time for its portrayal of drug addiction as a serious topic, The Man with the Golden Arm was initially released without the MPAA’s seal of approval, sparking a change in production codes that eventually allowed movies the freedom to explore more deeply formerly taboo subjects."
