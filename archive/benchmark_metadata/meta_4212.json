        "MaxLine Compressed Air Tubing Master Kit is a semi-flexible tubing that uses compression fittings for leakproof performance. It is designed for efficient installation in settings from small shops to large manufacturing facilities. Included with this bundle is a 10-Pack of MaxLine Pipe Mounting Clips to keep the tubing secure and contained. This air compressor tubing is constructed with an aluminum core surrounded by an inner and outer layer of polyethylene, able to hold any shape bent manually by hand. To straighten the tubing, run it through our straightening tool, or use the bender tool to make precise angles (tools sold separately). To modify the piping tubing to your needs, simply cut to length and insert in the fitting, and tighten. Expanding is made easy with more air outlet locations to modify later. The kit includes 100 feet of 0.5-Inch tubing, (3) air outlet kits, compressor manifold kit, (5) elbow fittings, deburr, and cutter tool. The tubing can be mounted on wall surfaces, in-wall, buried underground, or concrete using the easy-install, single-hold mounting clips. Each clip can withstand 175 pounds per square inch. Connect your system as pain-free as possible with the MaxLine Tubing Master Kit and Mounting Clip 10-Pack."
