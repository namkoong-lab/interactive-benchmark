        "My name is Connor Williams and people say I’m crazy. But that’s not who I am. They also think I’m straight, and mean, and dangerous. But that’s not who I am. The stories people tell—all those legends they whisper at school—they don’t mean a thing. Only my mother and younger brother matter to me. Funny then that I find myself wanting to stand up for someone else. David Henry, the cute bookish guy who always keeps to himself, is about to get his ass beat by a bunch of dudes bigger than him. I could look away, let him be one more causality of this cruel world… But that’s not who I am.",
