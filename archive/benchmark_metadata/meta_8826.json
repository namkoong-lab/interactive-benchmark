        "Have you ever wondered if you need to use a flash in sunlight?  What the best lighting is for a macro shot?  How long your exposure should be in low lighting?  If you have, this book is for you!  Lighting affects composition, focus, exposure decisions, and pretty much everything about taking a picture. Further, the mood of the photograph is totally dependent on the lighting - and can make or break the image. It is also one of the hardest things for a budding photographer to grasp. The existing lighting books tend to require expensive equipment and extensive knowledge on how to light photos.  For those who aren't at that level yet, this guide shows how to take shots in certain settings and times, such as lighting for specific seasons, back-lighting, water lighting, available light at mid-day, and more. Loaded with photos, tips, tricks, and inspiration, you can't  help but walk away from this book with the critical knowledge you need to know to take the perfect picture."

However, his chief interest was photography, which occupied most of his time during his four years at the school.', 'Although Hunter had grown up in a photography tradition (his grandfather invented multi-lens printing and his father made his own camera to photograph his experiences as a U.S. Marine in WWII), his most influential mentor was Ross Scroggs, Sr., Director of Photography at UNC-CH.', 'Although Scroggs was an acclaimed photographic technology teacher and also handled lighting brilliantly, lighting was the only area he had difficulty teaching. Since Scroggs had taught everything else, Hunter set out to fill that gap. The book Light – Science and Magic, written with Paul Fuqua and Stephen Biver, is the result.', 'Hunter has also been the lead writer of The McGraw-Hill Photography Course and Illusion: The Art and Science of Photographic Special Effects.', 'He is married to Robin Reid, a portrait specialist who has done the official portraits of several high-ranking U.S. officials. He and Robin are now working together on a new book with an expected publication date of mid-2011.']}"
