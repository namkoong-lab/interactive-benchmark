        "From the Author",
        "The story that became The Winter Prince took root in my mind when I was fifteen, and took some ten years to put together as a book. The character of Medraut in his early form would probably be unrecognizable now, even to me, but one aspect of his personality never changed. His story has always been about jealousy, and learning to cope with it. The book is set in sixth century Britain, but the emotional struggle of its characters is timeless. I tried to make a point of this in the prologue. In the first scene of The Winter Prince there is no setting at all--no time (other than the season and the time of day), no place, no context for the father and son that are speaking. I wanted them to represent any parent and child, anywhere, any time, trying to love each other, trying to communicate.",
        "The Winter Prince was my first novel, originally published ten years ago. It is a delight to me that it is reprinted now, to coincide with the release of its sequel, A Coalition of Lions. A third book, The Sunbird, will soon follow."

Wein', 'about': [\"I was born in New York City in 1964, and moved to England when I was 3. I started school there. We lived practically in the shadow of Alderley Edge, the setting for several of Alan Garner's books and for my own first book The Winter Prince; that landscape, and Garner's books, have been a lifelong influence on me.\", \"My father, who worked for the New York City Board of Education for most of his life, was sent to England to do teacher training at what is now Manchester Metropolitan University. He helped organize the Headstart program there. When I was six he was sent to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica for three years to do the same thing in Kingston. I loved Jamaica and became fluent in Jamaican patois (I can't really speak it any more, but I can still understand it); but in 1973 my parents separated, and we ended up back in the USA living with my mother in Harrisburg, PA, where her parents were. When she died in a car accident in 1978, her wonderful parents took us in and raised us.\", 'I went to Yale University, spent a work-study year back in England, and then spent seven years getting a PhD in Folklore at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. While I was there I learned to ring church bells in the English style known as \"change ringing\", and in 1991 I met my future husband there at a bell ringers\\' dinner-dance. He is English, and in 1995 I moved to England with him, and then to Scotland in 2000.', \"We share another unusual interest--flying in small planes. My husband got his private pilot's license in 1993 and I got mine ten years later. Together we have flown in the States from Kalamazoo to New Hampshire; in Kenya we've flown from Nairobi to Malindi, on the coast, and also all over southern England. Alone, most of my flying has been in eastern Scotland.\", 'We have two children.']}"
