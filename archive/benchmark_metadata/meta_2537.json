        "I'll happily admit it. My favourite Regency hero of all time is Mr Darcy. Bizarrely I love his aloof stiffness. I love it because you just know it's an outer shell he wears like armour, a face he presents to the world, but underneath it he is positively boiling with suppressed emotions. Especially the passion he has for Miss Elizabeth Bennett.It should hardly come as a surprise that I wanted to write my own Mr Darcy. His name is Bennett Montague- and yes that was a deliberate salute to",

        "and the brilliant Jane Austen- the 16th Duke of Aveley who has been groomed from birth to become Prime Minister one day. Bennett is as serious and formal as it is possible for a man to be, 'his upper lip so stiff it could be used to slice strawberries'. Yet beneath all of that he is a man who feels things a little too deeply and cringes at his own behaviour. He was great fun to write.The original idea from the story came from a history documentary series, '",

These books were hugely popular at the time and literally told people how to behave in every situation, from serving tea to a visitor to proposing marriage. All very proper and ever so slightly pompous. Within minutes I had an idea.What if I made my Mr Darcy write one? It stood to reason that if he intended to be Prime Minister before he turned forty he would need the right sort of wife to stand dutifully by his side. So Bennett writes",

        ". A manual to help upright, well-bred gentleman like himself choose the correct sort of wife in a pragmatic, dispassionate way. It stood to reason, the book would be a runaway best-seller and that the ladies in society would read it voraciously in order to lure worthy men into marriage. And wouldn't it be funny if I gave Bennett a harem of eager admirers, whittled down to the last five 'Potentials' to be his duchess? Five simpering,calculated women of impeccable breeding who live by the edicts set down in his book who are all competing for that wedding ring.Over several glasses of wine, I wrote a series of snippets from Bennett's book, little pearls of his misguided wisdom, which begin each chapter of",

        "You get the gist?Of course, what Bennett thinks he wants and what his heart needs could not be further apart. My heroine had to be the exact polar opposite of the perfect bride he writes about. Wholly unsuitable on every level, who drives him to distraction, challenges him and all the fiercely held beliefs he stands for. Amelia leads him on quite the merry dance, out of the pampered luxury of Mayfair and into the notorious London slum of Seven Dials. The poor man is never quite sure whether he wants to kiss her or kill her as she inadvertently worms her way beneath his tough outer shell and into his heart-sometimes with hilarious consequences.Of all the heroes I have created so far, Bennett is a favourite and even though I have read",
