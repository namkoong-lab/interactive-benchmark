        "The Grand Union Flag 1775 is also known as the Continental flag, it is the first true U.S. Flag. It combined the British King's Colours and the thirteen stripes signifying Colonial unity. George Washington liked this design so well that he chose it to be flown to celebrate the formation of the Continental Army on New Years Day, 1776. On that day the Grand Union Flag was proudly raised on Prospect Hill in Somerville, near his headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts. This top quality 3'x 5' Continental flag made is in the USA by a leading flag company from durable heavyweight nylon. It is finished with a strong canvas heading and 2 brass grommets. Looks great indoors or outdoors.",
