        "“If you've ever met or worked with Eileen, you know it s a little like applying a live wire to your brain. Stuff twitches as a result. In a good way. This book is full of short and sweet tactics to keep your energy, focus and impact high. Some you know. Some you've forgotten. And a bunch (say, #29, #16 and #60 as three starters) I bet you don’t…”",

        "At the end of the day it's all about ENERGY: YOUR energy. Consider this your pint-sized atomic recharger. And it's small because you don't have the time (or energy) to read through pages and pages. You want help: NOW! Some of the ideas are self-evident BUT we forget to practice them. Others are more thought-provoking because after all we're the ones who allowed the energy drain.A perfect desktop or nightstand companion. A perfect gift for anyone in your life who seems to think tired is his or her middle name and balance is as impossible as riding a unicycle. Read and reap!"
