        "This is the story of a young dragon's adventures as he discovers his hidden courage. Crimson the Dragon's special gift is the ability to shed precious rubies. When Princess Penelope wanders into his cave looking for love, Crimson gives her a magical necklace. But the necklace attracts the unwanted attention of a greedy local dragon and a conflict ensues that threatens the whole village. Crimson learns he has a fearsome power that he uses and regrets. Will Crimson accept that he caused harm to do good? Will the nasty dragons and their thieving ways force Crimson to stay confined to his cave or will he, despite his mother's warning, emerge from the cave to help save the Princess and restore harmony to the Kingdom? Will the lonely dragon and the Princess both achieve their heart's desires to restore peace? Will Crimson help her reach her true love? Will Love conquer evil in the end?"
