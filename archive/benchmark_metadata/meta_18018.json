        "Hawk Racing Derailleur Pulleys are one of the lowest friction pulleys in the industry. They have been designed to last longer and even replace your ceramic pulley set. Our derailleur pulleys are made from Alloy 7505 instead of plastic. This means that not only do our bearings (powered by Folmer TechnologyTM) spin smoother and keep going longer than other brands, but our pulleys are also more durable with very low friction, lighter than other brands, and service free.",
        "Our pulleys are used by Kenda Pro Cycling, Wonderful Pistachios Pro Cycling and Global Bikes to name a few teams.",
        "If you use a Shimano/Campy set up, you will need to purchase the Shimano version derailleur pulley.",
        "If you use a SRAM set up, you will need to purchase the SRAM version derailleur pulley. This version comes with a bushing that allows you to compensate for the two different screw sizes of some SRAM set ups.",
        "NOTE: If you use a Shimano 11 speed Rear Derailleur, you must order the 11 speed pulleys. The 10 speed version should not be used for an 11 speed group set or vice versa.",
        "NOTE: Pulleys come as a pair (for one bicycle)"
