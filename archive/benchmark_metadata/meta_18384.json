        "TrendyLuz watch bands come in a variety of colors to fit any occasion and style. Each band is made of high quality nylon material, which is lightweight, soft, breathable, and durable. The 10\" length fits most people of all ages, with wrist circumference from 5 1/4\" to 8 1/4\". Choose your favorite color and band width (20 mm or 22 mm) based on your current band width or watch lug width. Each band comes with 4 spring bars for your timepiece. Buy more than 1 to quickly change your look.Sizing instructions: To select a band size, measure the lug width of the watch or band width at the connection point to the watch face. The width closest to your measurement should be used (20 or 22mm).Installation instruction with spring bars installed and no strap on the watch: Pull the long part of the band out of the floating metal keeper, so the two layers of the band are separated. Then insert the watch band from the top side (12 o'clock) between spring bar and watch case, pull through behind watch case, and up through the other spring bar. Pull the long part of the watch strap back through the floating keeper. Pull it all the way through, and tighten so the floating section of the strap is snug up against the watch case. Adjust so the watch face is centered on the band.To remove spring bar and non-NATO style strap: From the back side of your watch case, insert the pronged (forked) end of your spring bar tool in between the strap and the watch lug. The spring bar has a ridge on the end that the tool will grab, allowing it to compress. Gently apply pressure inward and out (away from the watch) to depress the spring bar and pop it out.If you are unsure about installation/removal, recommend taking to a jeweler for best results."
