        "What food did the ancient Israelites eat, and how much of it did they consume? That's a seemingly simple question, but it's actually a complex topic. In this fascinating book Nathan MacDonald carefully sifts through all the relevant evidence -- biblical, archaeological, anthropological, environmental -- to uncover what the people of biblical times really ate and how healthy (or unhealthy) it was. Engagingly written for general readers, What Did the Ancient Israelites Eat? is nonetheless the fruit of extensive scholarly research; the book's substantial bibliography and endnotes point interested readers to a host of original sources. Including an archaeological timeline and three detailed maps, the book concludes by analyzing a number of contemporary books that advocate a return to “biblical” eating. Anyone who reads MacDonald's responsible study will never read a “biblical diet” book in the same way again."

        "Review",
        "I heartily recommend it for three big reasons: a very readable book, careful in method and approach, and judicious in conclusion. There is nothing simplistic and grandiose about this book. --Prof. Scot McKnight, North Park University, ChicagoThis book offers a veritable cornucopia of information to its readers. It is well researched, broadly synthetic, and distills a vast array of data...It is a pleasure to read, and a joy to recommend. --Jeremy Hutton, Princeton SeminaryMacDonald's book is a joy to read...It is a useful book, handy for students, scholars, and anyone interested in life in ancient periods, including the lives of the Israelites.'  --Raz Kletter, Helsinki UniversityIt's not my intention to sound overly enthusiastic lest you think me to be exaggerating.  But it isn't hyperbole to say that this is one of the most enjoyable and interesting books I've read in a good while. --Jim West, Quartz School of TheologyThe book would be an excellent catalyst for discussion of contemporary ethical concerns about food, such as its radically uneven availability, food safety and cost, and ecological problems of production. --Kathlyn O'Conner, Columbia TS",

        "What Did the Ancient Israelites Eat?",
        "is a fascinating and eye-opening glimpse into the eating patterns and problems of the ancient Israelites. Judiciously using a variety of sources, MacDonald examines the culinary past, with results that challenge many scholarly and popular notions of the diet in biblical days. Complex scientific analyses are presented in a highly readable form, making this book an engaging and rewarding page-turner.\" Carol Meyers, Duke University",
