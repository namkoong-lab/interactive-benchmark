        "Product Description",
        "This Academy Award-winning film tells the unforgettable story of Gerda Weissmann Klein and her six-year ordeal as a victim of Nazi cruelty. Rendered in a deceptively simple yet extraordinarily powerful manner, the film explores the effects Weissmans experience had on the rest of her life. By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. A journey of survival through one of the most devastating events in the history of mankind.",
