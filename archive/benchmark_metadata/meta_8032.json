Rossetti began writing when she was seven, but was thirty-one before she saw her first publication. During the 1860s and '70s she worked in a refuge for former prostitutes. She was widely regarded as one of the most important women poets of the Victorian era. She died in 1894 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery.
