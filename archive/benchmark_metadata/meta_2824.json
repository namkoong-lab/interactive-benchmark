        "\"Postcards Left Behind\" is a compelling collection of poetry that shares an underlying theme of regret while balancing the transformation taking place over a period of several years and across many miles. The author takes us on a breathtaking journey of self-discovery in a search for fulfillment and purpose. Regret connects every one of us. Don't we all have someone we considered reaching out to, only to acknowledge they were no longer in our lives? Everyone has felt some form of regret, although it certainly manifests in different ways. But fundamentally, the feeling is there. We've all missed out on something, and we have something that we wish went differently. Oftentimes, we're left wondering why things turned out the way that they did. \"Postcards Left Behind\" describes missed opportunities, leaving the reader wondering why they were never sent."
