        "Ginger has a long history of use for stimulating healthy digestion, promoting healthy inflammation, supporting heart health, and alleviating occasional nausea. Gaia Herbs Ginger Supreme is traditionally used for supporting healthy digestion.* This blend of herbs helps support overall healthy digestion and relieves occasional nausea.* It contains a comforting blend of ginger and turmeric, and is a great aid for those times when you occasionally overindulge.* From seed to shelf, Gaia is deeply committed to the purity, integrity, and potency of each product. Since Gaia Herbs was just a seedling in 1987, we have focused on connecting people, plants, and the planet to create healing. We use only organic methods to cultivate more than 6.5 million plants each year. That same organic approach continues throughout our manufacturing. We use patented technology to achieve the highest efficacy of each herb. We are a company devoted to transparency. We have created Gaia’s MeetYourHerbs platform, one of the world’s first and only herb traceability programs, allowing consumers to learn about and engage with their organic herbs. We are able to source premium ingredients so you always know what's in your supplement.  As a Certified B Corporation, we are actively working toward building a more inclusive and sustainable world. We nurture healthy connections between plants and people by encouraging strong relationships and championing environmental sustainability within the communities that we work with around the world."
