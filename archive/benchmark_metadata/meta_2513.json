        "A gratitude journal can transform your life! During a season of transition in my life, I found myself overwhelmed with negative emotions like self-pity and a complaining spirit. It was as if a dark cloud had descended over me. I prayed and asked God for wisdom on how to overcome these negative emotions. And I sensed Him leading me to do a 21 day gratitude challenge. Over the course of the 21 days, God began to change me as I spent intentional time being grateful for all I have been given. I did this through writing in my journal each day and also sending a hand-written thank you note to someone different each day. And now I want to share what I learned with you.What to Expect On Each Day of the Challenge:- Read my personal stories, struggles and reflections. - Read one scripture and one quote about gratitude. - Apply one personal application step. - Get accountability and encouragementAlong with the 21 day challenge, I also started a private Facebook group to provide accountability and encouragement not only for myself but also for others who join me in this challenge. You will get access to this group as well when you buy the book. It has been amazing to see God at work in each of our lives.Will you join us? Scroll up and click \"buy\" to embark on this 21 day gratitude challenge with us and start your own life-changing gratitude journal!"
