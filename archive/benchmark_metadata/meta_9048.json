        "DARWIN'S ATHLETES focuses on society's fixation with black athletic achievement. Hoberman argues that this obsession has come to play a troubling role in African American life and our country's race relations. Rich, flamboyant superstars lend credence to age-old prejudices, recycled \"scientific\" theories denigrating black intelligence, and stereotypes of black violence. This portrayal of black identity encourages a disdain for academic achievement already too widespread among black males. Darwin's Athletes is a powerful indictment of modern sport's racial spectacle."

        "From Library Journal",
        "Hoberman (Germanic languages, Univ. of Texas at Austin) has studied the cultural complexities of race in sport for 25 years. Arguing that our obsession with black athletes ultimately perpetuates the myth of race, he examines society's fixation on black athletic achievement, which he feels fosters a delusion of integration. Hoberman challenges established beliefs in a thought-provoking, albeit disturbing manner, offering arguments that are convincing, controversial, and guaranteed to spark debate. Although well researched and featuring an exhaustive bibliography and notes, this work is not for everyone. Recommended for large public and academic libraries, or where demand warrants.?Larry Robert Little, Penticton P.L., British Columbia,Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "Darwin's Athletes zeroes in on our society's fixation on black athletic achievement. John Hoberman compellingly argues that this obsession - one shared by both blacks and whites in the media, in corporate America, and even by athletes themselves - has come to play a disastrous role in African-American life and a troubling role in our country's race relations. The sports fixation originates in the painful century-long exclusion of blacks from every other path to high achievement. The scarcity of other kinds of \"race heroes\" has conferred messianic status on the most popular black athletes, fostering a delusion of integration while contributing to deep social divisions. Ironically, Hoberman argues, the decline of European empires and the rise of the black athlete helped to preserve rather than undermine the inferior status of nonwhites.",
