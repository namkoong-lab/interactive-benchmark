        "Johnnie Wise was just fifteen years old when her mother sold her virginity to an unscrupulous white insurance man named Earl Shamus. Stunningly beautiful, with long naturally wavy black hair, she possessed the voluptuous body of a thirty-year-old woman. Her skin was the color of brown sugar. Johnnie had heard about Earl Shamus and his escapades among the poor black women in New Orleans. But what she didn’t know was that Shamus had quietly made several of the girls in their neighborhood his reluctant concubines when their youthful bodies ripened—she was next. Enter 1950’s New Orleans, a world of betrayal, envy, lust and murder, where everyone has ulterior motives. Take a peek at Johnnie Wise, a 15-year-old girl, being pursued by ruthless crime boss, Napoleon Bentley, who will stop at nothing to have this young beauty. Little Girl Lost will shock you right up to the very end with its revealing truths."

He served his country in Texas, Mississippi, Nevada, California, Turkey, and various other places in his four years of active service. He has written in several genres, including suspense/thrillers, drama, historical fiction, and contemporary fiction. His most successful novels are the Little Black Girl Lost stories, seven to date. The journey to publication was an arduous one and began at Robert S. Rogers High School during the Fall semester when his composition teacher ridiculed him in front of his peers for a poorly written paper. Humiliated, he dropped the class, and no longer pursued education. Two decades later, he entered Owens Community College, as it was more cost effective. Upon graduation, he planned to attend a fully accredited local university to get a degree in psychology, as he never intended to be an author. That, too, was interrupted by a literature professor who challenged his ability to write a credible story early in the Fall semester. Unlike his high school experience, he accepted the challenge, picked up a pen that very day, and has been writing ever since. His failed past turned into fierce determination. He worked full-time and was a full-time student. He graduated with honors and became the commencement speaker for the December graduating class. He lives in Toledo, Ohio.
