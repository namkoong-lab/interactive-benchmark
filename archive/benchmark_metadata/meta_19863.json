        "Featuring no hum, but all the growl, depth and sparkle that a P 90 is famous for. This radical departure from electric guitar pickup design is aluminum based, rather than copper. Result: less resistance, higher output coupled to a \"current driven design\" as opposed to conventional voltage based guitar pickups. The aluminum water jet cut exoskeleton is then matted to a micro winding using 90% less fine copper wire, a low impedance/high impedance pickup is then created. Broadband response like our single coil version, but voiced for the classic mid range response, humbucker tone. Installing two of these Alumitones on your guitar will save you 1/3lb of weigh and increase your guitars resonance!"
