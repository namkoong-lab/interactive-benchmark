        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "This admiring, undiscriminating biography by a freelance writer breathlessly follows the career of the American beauty who invented the brassiere to wear at her New York society debut in 1910. Divorced from an alcohol-prone husband by whom she had two children, Mary Phelps Jacob (1892-1970) married Harry Crosby, who gave her the name Caresse and with whom she lived profligately in Paris, wrote poetry and published Joyce, Eliot and Pound in her Black Sun Press. After Harry killed himself and his girlfriend in 1929, Caresse, \"always partial to titles,\" never ceased her quest for adventure and numerous lovers. She ran a gallery of modern art in wartime Washington, published a cultural magazine, espoused the cause of world citizenship, and later, as \"principessa\" of Roccasinibalda, a 72-room ruined castle outside Rome, entertained young literati for whom, with limited funds, she \"could make a Renaissance meal out of a package of soup and a poetry reading.\" Photos not seen by PW.

        "From Library Journal",
        "Called by Anais Nin \"a pollen carrier, who mixed, stirred, brewed, and concocted friendships,\" Crosby is best known as an expatriate in 1920s Paris who, with her husband Harry, founded Black Sun Press. Their life in Paris has already been chronicled in Geoffrey Wolfe's Black Sun (1976), which stops with Harry's suicide in 1929. Conover provides no new insights into those hedonistic years, instead concentrating on the following 41 years of Crosby's life as poet, publisher, and social activist. Indeed, though parts of Conover's book closely parallel Crosby's own autobiography ( The Passionate Years , 1968), it provides even more detail of her later years. Still, Crosby remains somewhat of an enigma. Recommended for academic and larger public libraries as a chronicle of a free spirit whose contributions range from the invention of the bra to publishing Pound and Joyce.",

        "Review",
        "Caresse Crosby is probably one of the least recognizable of all the names remembered from the literary and artistic circles of 1920s Paris, yet her life touched the most promising and gifted artists of a generation. Idealist, poet, friend, lover, and muse to figures such as Hemingway, Henry Miller, Anais Nin, and Dali~ Caresse Crosby deserves to be remembered. Anne Conover has unearthed a gem with her account of this free-spirited and flamboyant woman. --",
