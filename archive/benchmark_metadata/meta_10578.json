        "Macca To Mecca! Begins as a 12-song tribute to The Beatles that kicks off with a performance of \"I Saw Her Standing There\" recorded in London with a special appearance by Paul McCartney. It is followed by an extraordinary surprise set at the Cavern Club recorded during the band's sold out European tour. The intimate gig is filled with renditions of \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" \"Got To Get You Into My Life,\" and \"All You Need Is Love,\" alongside iconic songs famously performed by the nascent Fab Four."
