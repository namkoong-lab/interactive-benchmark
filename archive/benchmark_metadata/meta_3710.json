        "This listing is for 6 pieces of red & black two tone turkey quill wing feathers and are approximately 10-12 inches in length and 1-1/2 to 2 inches wide. The width of these feathers make them an artist favorite for painting or drawing on. The stiffness of the quill makes it a perfect feather for quill pens. This style of turkey wing feather is a two dip dye colors on each feather resulting in 2 vivid colors on a single feather. This is a very unique feather, so similar to eagle feathers we must repeat ourselves that these are an imitation that is definitely a must have for Native American crafts such as dream catchers and headdresses.
