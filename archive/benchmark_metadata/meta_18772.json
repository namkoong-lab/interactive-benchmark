        "How To Apply :",
        "1.Open the clips that are sewed on the weft.  2. Separate your hair. Starting at the lower back section of your head, use a tail comb to divide(horizontally part)your hair, at the lower back of the head i.e. just below one ear to the second ear. Also, you can start parting even lower, as low as you want to place the first weft. 3.Release the hair you held and then repeat the process above until you apply all hair extensions.",
        "Care Tips:",
        "1. Remove the extensions at the end of the day before going to bed. Try not to wash your hair extensions.  2. Put the hair into a sealed poly-bag when you are not using it. Avoid letting the hair contact acid, alkaline or corrosive chemicals. 3.Avoid ironing the hair. Inappropriate high temperatures will harm the hair."
