        "This essential, authoritative handbook provides clear, accurate coverage of zoonoses ― diseases that can spread from animals to humans. The consistent format helps you quickly locate key information, such as how each disease affects the host, how it is spread, how it is treated, and necessary safety precautions. It also discusses the importance of educating animal owners about the public health implications of zoonoses and how to prevent them from spreading.",

        "The handbook has a simple and easy-to-follow style. The format for the sections on each of the zoonoses is readable and helpful, covering the basics of disease in animals (where relevant) and people, routes of transmission, diagnosis, treatment and prevention.With the ever-increasing recognition that animals are major reservoirs of human diseases and that most emerging infections in people are zoonotic in nature, this handbook is a welcome tool.",
