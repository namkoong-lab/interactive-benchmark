Use it in the bread machine or in the pan. You just never know when the need to bake may arise! Fleischmann's, a company started by brothers, revolutionized baking by creating a compressed yeast cake in 1868 as an alternative to inconsistent starter and leavener agents. Their Instant Dry Yeast has a finer texture than more granular active dry yeast, so there's no need to mix it with water. Add to other dry ingredients, mix with wet ingredients and follow your recipe. Fleischmann's Instant Dry Yeast will help make bread that is light, fluffy and fully-raised every time. This simple and consistent Instant Dry Yeast can be enjoyed in so many ways. Here are some of our favorite uses for it: -For making airy, chewy pizza dough. -Crafting large soft pretzels, perfect with mustard for a savory snack or a dusting of cinnamon and sugar for a sweet treat. -It can be used in conjunction with gluten-free flours to make breads that are safe for those who avoid gluten. -For baking fluffy Bundt cakes, decadent pull-apart breads and streusel-topped coffee cake."
