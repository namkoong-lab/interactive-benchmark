    "description": [
        "Liquid Harvest Trio controls unwanted woody plants, vines, and perennial broadleaf weeds around homes, cabins, fences, and walkways. Application Methods: For best results, apply as a full coverage foliar spray when brush and weeds are fully leafed out and actively growing. Wilting or other symptoms will occur in 1 to 6 weeks. Apply only when the air is calm to prevent drift to desirable vegetation. Rainfall within 24 hours may reduce effectiveness. Foliage Spray: Using a hose-end or tank sprayer, mix 8 to 16 tablespoons (4 to 8 fl oz) in enough water to make one gallon mixed spray. For mature or hard-to-control plants (such as ash, blackgum, choke cherry, elm, maple, oak, pine, or winged elm), or during drought conditions, use the highest application rate indicated. Resprouting may occur in the year following treatment when lower rates are used. The addition of a surfactant (spreader/sticker) enhances herbicidal action and improves distribution of the spray on hard-to-wet plant surfaces. Lazer Blue is a concentrated colorant designed to be used with herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Lazer indicates where application spray has been made for the most accurate coverage. The colorant will fade in time with sun and moisture. Lazer is not permanent and will not stain once diluted. Avoid contact with fabric. Lazer can be removed from skin and equipment with several washes. Directions: Add 1/2 oz.of Lazer Blue to every gallon of spray mixture. The more Lazer you use, the darker your spray pattern. POURING ADVICE- To get the smoothest pour with no mess have the FRONT label pointing towards the sky. You need to pour slowly and closely to your container in a controlled manner. Have both hands on the bottle and allow air flow to enter the spout as your pouring, DO NOT attempt to quickly dump this product in your sprayer or spraying equipment. Slow and steady while pouring this, allow airflow to enter the spout as if you were pouring gasoline. Follow"
