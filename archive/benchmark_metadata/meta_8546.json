        "*Starred Review* This work contains essays previously published in volume 1 of The Oxford Companion to the Book (2010) with three additional essays: one on intellectual property and copyright, one on censorship, and one covering the Caribbean and Bermuda. The volume is divided into two parts. The first part consists of 21 thematic essays covering familiar topics, such as sacred books, various print technologies, and bookbinding, as well as the less familiar, such as missionary printing. In the second part, 49 essays explore the history of books in various parts of the world. Just as in the original work, the essays are of a scholarly nature and are geared toward specialist academicians, but they are extremely well written. The notion of “book” is very broad, as is the coverage here. A wide variety of topics are explored: the physical book from the beginning of writing systems to digital texts (including pre-Gutenberg forms such as tablets, hides, shells, and leaves); the production of books (covering areas such as printing, bookbinding, and bookselling); legal topics (such as intellectual property and censorship); and specialized forms (such as children’s books and religious texts). Curiously, there isn’t a thematic essay on libraries—which seems especially erroneous since some of the essays cover esoteric or less common aspects of books. The geographic essays occupy about two-thirds of the text. The coverage here is extensive, but it is biased toward Western countries—possibly because mass printing was invented in Europe. Readers looking for Central Asia have to reference the chapter on the Muslim world as well as the chapter covering China. Unfortunately, geographic regions are very sparingly referenced in the index. There are short bibliographies at the end of each essay. For readers interested in an academic treatment of the history of books, bookmaking, and the business of books, this collection of essays is a good place to start. More affordable than the original two-volume set, this dissemination of The Oxford Companion to the Book is highly recommended for academic libraries and for public libraries where there is an interest in a scholarly treatment of books. --Muhammed Hassanali",
