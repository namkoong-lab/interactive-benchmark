        "Have you ever wondered if Satan is real?Does the God of the Universe allow an evil creature to roam the cosmos and harm humanity? How can God allow Satan to exist when He could just destroy him with a thought? What about being burned in Hell forever. Is there really a prison of pain and suffering where dead souls languish in everlasting torture...FOREVER?If you’ve been taught Satan is real and you truly believe in this mythical creature; if you have ever had questions about a fallen angel who became Lord of the Underworld, then starting here is one of the best things you can do.In this volume of the Satan Christianity's Other God series, you get answers to questions about Satan and Hell that many have asked since they were children. Canadian author and researcher, James Brayshaw, puts an end to Satan and Hell forever.Readers of this work see how religion has been clinging to an error about Satan. The clear logic and reason, the masterful exploration of ancient thought about Satan, and the in depth examination about what the New Testament is, helps you understand Satan is not real. Within just a few pages, you'll discover how Satan became Christianity's second god. We find out where the dead go, if psychics use satanic power to talk to dead spirits, how Satan became part of Christianity, and why we can't use the New Testament to build a doctrine of Satan.‘Imagine There's No Satan’ shows that Satan is a construct of human culture, not a doctrine from the Bible. You are about to get more than just answers, you get the tools to make sense of words like 'Satan,' 'devils,' 'demons' and 'unclean spirits.'…Maybe Satan isn't real....and maybe it's okay to question contemporary thought on Satan and Hell to get some answers that make sense."

        "About the Author",
        "James R. Brayshaw spent years studying, teaching, and writing about the religion he was raised in. His research about the origin of Satan has brought him to become an authority on the subject. He lives in Western Canada with his wife and two sons. James has worked to extinguish the fire of hell and Satan with the tenacity needed to fight a three alarm blaze. His passion for research and pursuit to understand why we believe what we believe, has led to this revealing and informed work on the non-existence of a cosmic Satan. Brayshaw finds answers that make sense to questions about religious beliefs. James R. Brayshaw has journeyed through Pentecostal Christianity where, after serving as a leader for 11 years, he was eventually asked to leave for questioning the status quo of traditional teaching. This once charismatic Christian has found freedom from Christianity's most notorious demon by taking the traditional teachings of religion to the grindstone of sound research. James presents the concept that Satan is not a creation of God but is a fabrication of man. His work shows how history and the Bible support this view. This engaging author and teacher will move you to find answers to the difficult questions of religion. Or at the very least, encourage you to begin asking questions of your own. Brayshaw's belief is that everyone can find the truth about Satan and Hell if they honestly investigate their beliefs and search for answers. There are few authors who take the time to unravel the most convoluted teachings of religion with the clarity and commitment Brayshaw does. James can be heard on the Imagine There's No Satan - radio show at http: //www.blogtalkradio.com/jrbrayshaw.",
