        "WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU A new way to achieve deep hydration in a professional moisture mask. Get an immediately radiant complexion and long-lasting hydration after just one use. Think dewy, radiant skin in as quickly as 5 minutes. Dry, dehydrated, aging skin is plumped to show off your gorgeous, inner glow.",
        "Powered by marine algae and hyaluronic acid, this hydrating mask molds to your skin, morphing from a soft gel to a rubbery cushion texture. As the mask transforms, the alginate gel locks in water and drives the essential moisturizing benefits directly into skin. Simply lift it off and see the difference",
        "HOW TO USE IT Once a week – mix Hyaluronic Cushion Gel (Step 1) with Activating Powder (Step 2) in a bowl. With the supplied spatula, immediately spread the formula in a thick, even layer on clean, dry skin – starting from the bottom of your face and working in upward strokes. Avoid the eye area. The thicker and more uniform the application, the easier it will be to remove the mask in one piece.",
        "The mask will set within 5-7 minutes but may be left on for up to 15 minutes for maximum hydration. To remove, lift off the mask and wipe away any excess with a damp cotton ball. No rinsing needed! Follow with a Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare serum and/or moisturizer of your choice.",
        "CONSUMER STUDY AFTER 1 USE 97% of participants agreed their skin was more hydrated 97% of participants agreed their skin looked and felt hydrated the next morning 90% of participants agreed their skin appeared healthier, smoother, and felt softer 87% of participants agreed their skin looked and felt more plump",
        "WHAT’S NEW? ✓ 33% more product for same price ✓ New natural scent ✓ Removed bowls for a more sustainable approach",
