        "Toba Khedoori’s exquisitely crafted and tantalizingly ambiguous drawings and paintings are the subject of this exciting monograph, which accompanies Khedoori’s first retrospective in 15 years. This book documents the artistic development of Toba Khedoori, a MacArthur \"Genius\" Award recipient who skillfully combines precise draftsmanship with a meditative quality, and who manages to invite viewers inside her works, despite their two-dimensionality. Whether drawing on sheets of paper primed with wax and stapled directly onto the wall or using canvas as physical support, Khedoori creates delicate compositions that are at once intimate and expansive. Over the past decade, she has shifted toward smaller-scale works while continuing to engage elements of drawing, painting, and installation."
