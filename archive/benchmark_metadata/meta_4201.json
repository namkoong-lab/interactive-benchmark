        "Product Description",
        "The product is a new saving-energy switch; it adopts microwave sensor mould with high-frequency electro-magnetic wave (5.8GHz), integrated circuit. It gathers automatism, convenience, safety, saving-energy and practicality functions. The wide detection field is consisting of detectors. It works by receiving human motion. When one enters the detection field, it can start the load at once and identify automatically day and night. Its installation is very convenient and its using is very wide. Detection is possible through doors, panes of glass or thin walls.",
        "Specifications:",
        "Model No. : BS029A  Power Sourcing: 110V/AC  Detection Range: 360 degree  Detection Distance: 1-8m (radius) adjustable  Frequency:: 5.8GHz  Ambient Light: 3-2000LUX (Adjustable)  Time-Delay: Min.: about 10sec Max.:12min  Transmission Power :< 10mW  Installing Sit: indoor, ceiling mounting  Power Consumption: approx 0.9W  Detection motion speed:0.6~1.5m/s  Rated Load:600W  Power frequency: 50/60Hz.",
        "Attention:",
        "The high-frequency output of this sensor is <10Mw- that is just one 100th of the transmission power of a mobile phone or the output of a microwave oven."
