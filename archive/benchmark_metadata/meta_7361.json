        "Traveled by mammoth-hunters and motorcyclists alike, the Minnesota River Valley shows the traces of a unique legacy: where else are you going to find a political party with ideals based on honest conversation and gymnastics? Not all of it is as lovely as the natural scenery it accompanies--Mankato was the site of the largest mass execution in United States history--but its heritage demands contemplation. Discover the valley's most enterprising characters, from Fort Snelling bootleggers like Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant to the Granite Falls lawyer behind Prohibition, Andrew Volstead. With a guide like Johanneck, you might meet some familiar figures in surprising circumstances as she steals up behind Dr. Mayo at the grave he was robbing for medical research or catches FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in a moment of unguarded correspondence."

        "About the Author",
        "Beth Johanneck was born a Minnesota farmer's daughter, with seven brothers and a fabulous sister, and raised on a farm near the tiny community of Wabasso. During her childhood, she was inspired by her mother's creativity and her father's gift for storytelling. She received a bachelor's degree in business from Southwest State University in Marshall, Minnesota, and grabbed an opportunity to work for a tourism office within the central part of the Minnesota River Valley.",
        "She currently resides in the Twin Cities but hasn't forgotten her rural roots, publishing a blog called the Minnesota Country Mouse Folk Blog, where the \"hayseed\" in her writing betrays her \"city-slicker\" aspirations. She subscribes to the early to bed, early to rise philosophy, celebrating the wee hours of the morning in her big chair with a stout cup of coffee and her computer."
