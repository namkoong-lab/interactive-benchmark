        "The Cooper-Atkins 50306-K Type K thermocouple air probe measures temperature from -100 to +600 degrees F (-73 to +316 degrees C). This probe is for monitoring ambient air temperatures in food service applications with a broad range of temperatures, including ovens, refrigeration units, and freezers. A stainless-steel shield protects the sensor from touching surfaces that would give a false air temperature. It has a response time of 10 seconds in a 5m/second air stream for fast readings. The stainless-steel cable measures 43\" and includes a metal mounting clip to hold the probe in place. It can withstand closure in an oven door.",
        "Cooper-Atkins manufactures time, temperature, and humidity instruments for industrial, HVAC/R, health care, and food safety applications. The company, founded in 1884, is headquartered in Middlefield, CT."
