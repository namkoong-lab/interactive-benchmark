        "Convertible Strap Bra - For a bra that offers the sort of all-day comfort women crave, especially dancers who are constantly moving, there might not be a better choice than the Motionwear convertible strap bra. This is a bra that utilizes the brand's UnderWears fabric, a proprietary blend of soft, sturdy fabrics. It also uses Tactel spandex, which supports and offers ample coverage.",
        "This is a very versatile bra, hence the name convertible. this means that you can actually remove the back from the bra for more comfort, and even adjust the shoulder straps for a more nuanced, comfortable fit.",
        "Known as your one-stop shop for any sort of dancing apparel you need, Motionwear got its start in the late 1980s, with items being sewn in Emily Wilson's attic. Since then, this company has definitely branched out, and whether a dance recital or a cheer comptetition, the participants are likely wearing something Motionwear created."
