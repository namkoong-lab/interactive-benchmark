        "About the Author",
        "Andrew Pommier is a quiet lad. He is not one to boast or brag about what he has done or what he is doing. It is like pulling teeth to get him to talk about up coming projects. Most of the time he just says \"he's working on stuff.\"",
        "In 2004 alone he has already exhibited at the Modart group show in Munich, Germany and another group show at antisocial in Vancouver, Canada entitled \"The Maligned Collection,\" which he also organized. The month after that he was in the south of France with his girlfriend enjoying the sights and sounds of that culturally rich region. In fact, Andrew likes to travel almost as much as he likes to draw and paint!",
        "His artistic time is split between his computer at home and his painting studio, which is a quick ten-minute bicycle ride away. As well as exhibiting in cities such as Toronto, New York, San Diego and San Francisco he has created commissions for Toy Machine skateboards, Manik skateboards, Element skateboards, C1RCA footwear and Momentum Wheel Co.",
        "Andrew has been profiled in magazines such as Transworld skateboarding, Thrasher, Lodown and Monster Children. He lives in Toronto with his girlfriend Tiffany and her dog and two cats. This is his first book."
