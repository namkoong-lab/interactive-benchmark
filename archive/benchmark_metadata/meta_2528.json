        "I never meant to end up in the middle of a vampire rebellion. But when vampire’s are running amuck in London and the Baron is refusing to do anything about it, I can’t exactly ignore the problem.It was bad enough when the Baron wouldn’t help, but now he’s blackmailing me into doing all the dirty work for him. If I don’t do as he says, he’ll tell the Order I’ve been working hand in hand with the vampires. It’s do or die. If I can’t get this rebellion under control, the city won’t survive the aftermath.",

I read just about everything--fantasy, science fiction, dystopian, historical fiction, and much more. I'm also an avid LARPer. Don't know what that is? Shoot me a message and I'll gab your ear off about it. I love to talk with fans, so don't be shy--be forewarned, though, I can rant a good bit.\", \"Join my Facebook group, Izzy's Wizard Nation, to get to know me better! https://www.facebook.com/groups/izzyswizardnation/\", \"I grew up in Wilson, North Carolina. It's a small town about an hour east of Raleigh, and I spent most of my time finding adventure, filling up notebooks with every story that came to my head, and being reprimanded by teachers for reading in class. My first fiction novel came out in January of 2017, and I release about every month; so sign up for the newsletter to stay on top of things!\"]}"
