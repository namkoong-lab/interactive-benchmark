        "Ever watch Top Chef, Iron Chef or any number of competition shows? When these Chefs run around a kitchen creating these incredible meals from next to nothing and wonder…what does this guy cook at home? Does his family eat that good?It’s been said that the crappiest running car in town belongs to the mechanics wife. Granted, Chef Johns family does eat their share of delivered pizzas and Chinese takeout. He does try to cook a great meal at home at least once a week, more often depending on work schedules. Never having made Duck Confit or Fois Gras for the family (they probably wouldn’t eat it anyway), but they do eat pretty well. Here are Chef Johns original recipes and family favorites. This is How the Chef at Home cooks."
