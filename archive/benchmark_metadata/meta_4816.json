        "The MAMBA X EXTREME ESC paired with our sensored 1406-3800kv motor is ideal for LOW SPEED CRAWLING OR TRAIL RUNNING in vehicles weighing up to 9lbs on 2s; it can also be used in more aggressive setups like rock racing and extended hill climbing on vehicles up to 5lbs. It can also be used in 2WD BUGGIES, STADIUM TRUCKS AND 4WD TOURING CARS; equivalent in RPM output to approximately a 10.5 turn. Your Mamba X ESC will come with our newest firmware that has been enhanced for rock crawling and sensored operation. Our 4-pole 12-slot sensored motor designs boast exceptional efficiency, and the oversized NMB bearings and vibration dampening system ensure the longest bearing life possible. High-strength, high-temperature grade neodymium sintered magnets combined with a high-strength Kevlar wrap ensures the integrity of the rotor is not compromised during harsh running conditions. You will reap the benefits of longer run times on one battery and a cooler running motor that can be pushed harder while enjoying the precise throttle control and buttery smooth starts that our sensored motors offer. The high-performance Mamba X also includes an integrated and powerful 8A adjustable BEC and is approved for all-weather use as it is housed in a rugged CNC-machined aluminum case and then potted in waterproof epoxy."
