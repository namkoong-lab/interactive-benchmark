        "''Enjoying and attuning myself to the many wonders of life is my creative process in composing my music. I try to clear my mind and emotions of thought and feeling so that I can be in the wondrous present moment. I want my music to lightly and simply touch the listener's heart, like a leaf falling gently onto soft grass. Like experiencing the quiet beauty of a sunset. I would like for my music to offer listeners an opportunity to sense the freedom within and discover their own unique paths to happiness and inner peace.'' -Kenio FukeWith acoustic piano, keyboards and a light layering of orchestral instruments, Fuke masterfully connects to the many wonders of life, lightly touching the listener's heart like a leaf falling gently onto soft grass."
