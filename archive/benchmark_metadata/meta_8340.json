        "Review",
        "“The novel's three sisters...ache on the page with honesty. In her debut novel, Kain writes bravely and beautifully, respecting the reader's capacity to respond with openness and a raw understanding of the turns life may take and to hold judgment as nuanced characters discover the many facets of their own complex beings.” ―",
        "Booklist (starred review)",
        "“A haunting, dark and at times harshly beautiful exploration of the scars left by hurt and loss.” ―",
        "Kirkus",
        "“While having Sarah speak from beyond the grave gives this novel a touch of the supernatural, Kain keeps her story and everyone in it grounded in reality. The author offers profound reflections on life, death, and the bonds of family, and as the suspense surrounding Sarah's death intensifies, readers will find it hard to put this novel down.” ―",
