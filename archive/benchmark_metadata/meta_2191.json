        "“The Kate Stanton Hollywood Mystery Series serves up the perfect mystery reader Cosmo – one part ‘I-didn’t-see-that-coming’ whodunit with a double shot of Hollywood glam.”",
        "Thanks to the huge success of the year’s blockbuster civil war epic, The Crossing at Blaisdell Park, there’s been a resurgence of interest in the former sixties musical duo, the Paisleys, and its only surviving member, Kate Stanton, who had recorded an interactive version of the duo’s first hit single for the movie. With an initial worldwide gross of just under a billion dollars and a sequel already in production, it looks like the The Crossing – as it’s been dubbed by the press – is going to go down in history as one of Hollywood’s most successful film franchises – until tragedy strikes, that is. Just as Kate is about to unveil the Paisleys’ long-awaited star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a stolen cargo van jumps the curb a few feet from where everyone is gathered, killing a woman dressed as Charlotte Valcour, the heroine in The Crossing. The tragedy follows a series of disastrous events which have overshadowed shooting of the sequel, fueling rumors that the shoot is being haunted by the ghost of the movie’s dead heroine. Things become even more complicated when the director of the movie suddenly disappears during shooting of a pivotal battle scene. Kate soon realizes that Charlotte’s ghost may not be the only thing they need to contend with as she finds herself dodging a killer intent on exposing the truth behind The Crossing at Blaisdell Park."

        "About the Author",
        "Marta Tandori had always been an avid reader but it wasn't until she began studying acting in her early twenties at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York that she realized acting wasn't really her passion - writing fiction was. Thanks to an overly zealous addiction in her youth to all things Nancy Drew and Trixie Belden, Marta fell in love with mysteries and it's hardly a surprise that she chose to write in the same genre! Marta's books feature strong female protagonists who have closets full of nasty skeletons and the odd murder or two to complicate their already complex lives. She's the author of the Kate Stanton Hollywood Mystery series as well as several other standalone mysteries.
