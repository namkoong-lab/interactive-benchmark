        "Review",
        "\"In an era where we spend more time expanding the list of reasons and factors contributing to why students cannot learn, Hierck quiets the noise, and in a practical and actionable way, reminds us of the factors we control that serve to ensure learning for all. Part of the power in this book lies in its tried and true universal truths, with updated applications for current leaders and educators.The other powerful part of Hierck's work is that he doesn't run from all the 'factors' that make the work of educators a challenging and complex process. Instead he meets them head-on with examples, case studies, research, and suggested strategies that tip the scale of influence away from factors outside our control and returns primary influence back to the educator. Tom's easy writing style will make you believe this a quick read. But, it's not. You're going to read, be reminded of an idea or strategy, and put the book down so you can incorporate it into your teaching and leading practices.\" --Kenneth Williams, Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, Unfold The Soul\"Teacher-student, teacher-parent, and teacher team relationships are some of the most misunderstood components of having a school live out its mission. Tom Hierck helps clarify these critical relationships and provides educators with the tools and resources to help us live our mission of ensuring high levels of learning for both students and adults in schools. Put this book in every teacher s hands and give them the immediate road map of where to begin! The honesty from Tom Hierck in this book is both refreshing and heartwarming. Hierck shares how his behavior as a teacher when dealing with student behavior was not always a best version of himself. It seems to have compelled him to write a detailed and turnkey guide for all educators to use in their classrooms and schoolwide. At the end of each chapter his Points to Remember and Strategies to Consider are enough to make one want to buy the book. This is a marvelous addition to our professional literature.\" --Brian K. Butler, Principal, Mason Crest Elementary School, Fairfax County, Virginia\"This concise, power-packed book weaves together research and real-life experiences that remind us of the importance of positive relationships and culture in our classrooms. Whether you are a new teacher struggling to establish routines or a veteran teacher struggling not to become jaded or cynical, this book is for you! Tom Hierck provides the reader with an easy-to-implement framework that is supported with helpful how-to strategies, case study examples, and succinct points worth remembering in each chapter. Hierck encourages all teachers to get to know each student's STORY. By combining the power of relationship-building with hands-on structures and strategies, Hierck provides every educator with a tool kit 'to be intentionally and explicitly positive, to ensure quality relationships for all students, and to be the difference makers' in the lives of kids. Isn't that what we all want in our classrooms and schools?\" --Charlie Coleman, Principal (Dual Campus), Cowichan Secondary School, Duncan, B.C., Canada",
