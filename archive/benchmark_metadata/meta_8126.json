        "Review",
        "\"In an age when the word 'Taoist' is thrown in front of everything from sex manuals to cookbooks, this volume is unique: a factual, straightforward account of how to get started being a Taoist.\"  --Ian Johnson, The Wall Street Journal    \"There is definitely room and necessity for a volume such as this, as it introdcues the practical, religious aspects of Daoism to a broader American audience.  I think it will make an important contribution to the better understanding of Daoism in the U.S. and help both scholars and practitioners alike.\"--Livia Kohn, Boston University    \"Brock Silvers has produced a 'tour de force,' a first-time attempt to make the practice of religious Taoism available to readers of the English language.\"--Michael Saso, University of Hawaii - Manoa",

        "Thanks to everyone for supporting",
        "The Taoist Manual",
        ", and especially to those people who have kindly posted their reviews, comments, & suggestions.  I hope the book succeeded in imparting additional insight into Taoist practice & culture.  Over time Independent Resellers began to unreasonably gouge interested readers, and it shouldn't cost a fortune to learn about Taoism. Thus we've now released a very low-cost kindle version, and I hope that everyone will continue to enjoy the book and to keep it handy on their favorite e-reader!",
