        "This super nice t-shirt is made of 100% cotton (except for heathered colors like Sport Gray or Ash Gray, which may have up to 10% poly) and features double needle sleeves and hems, a seamless double needle 7/8 inch collar, and is PRESHRUNK. It has taped neck and shoulders, and the lay of the fabric has been quarter turned to eliminate the center crease. Certain styles also feature tearaway labels. This item is available in sizes SMALL through 3XL. It is a standard ADULT UNISEX CUT, which means it is not fitted. This is a very comfortable shirt and it should last you for years and years to come."
