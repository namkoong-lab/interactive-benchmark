        "Linear Algebra",
        "provides a valuable introduction to the basic theory of matrices and vector spaces. The book covers: matrices, vector spaces, bases, and dimension; inner products, bilinear and sesquilinear forms over vector spaces; linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, and Jordan normal form; and fields and polynomials over fields. Abstract methods are illustrated with concrete examples, and more detailed examples highlight applications of linear algebra to analysis, geometry, differential equations, relativity and quantum mechanics. Rigorous without being unnecessarily abstract, this useful and concise guide to the subject will be important reading for all students in mathematics and related fields."

        "Review",
        "\"Kaye offers this work as a second course in linear algebra. As such, it deals with the specific subject matter of linear algebra in a way that could also be viewed as an introduction to abstract algebra or axiomatic mathematics in general. Knowledge of elementary matrix arithmetic and matrix methods--including the general solution to systems of linear equations and computation of inverses and determinants--is assumed, though these topics are briefly reviewed. Some exposure to abstract vector spaces and the notions of basis and dimension would also be helpful to one wishing to peruse this book. For those with a suitable background, this book provides a very rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of linear algebra, including inner product spaces, bilinear and quadratic forms, orthogonal bases, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the Jordan canonical form. Certainly appropriate for upper-division undergraduates entertaining thoughts of graduate work in mathematics.\"--",
