        "When sad-sack loser Frank (Rainn Wilson, THE OFFICE), a short-order cook, sees his ex-addict wife (Liv Tyler, THE LORD OF THE RINGS) willingly snatched away by a seductive drug dealer (Kevin Bacon), he finds himself bereft and unable to cope. But he decides to fight back under the guise of a do-it-yourself superhero called Crimson Bolt. With a red hand-made suit, a wrench, a crazed sidekick named Boltie (Ellen Page, JUNO) and absolutely nothing in the way of superpowers, Crimson Bolt beats his way through the mean streets of crime in hopes of saving his wife."
