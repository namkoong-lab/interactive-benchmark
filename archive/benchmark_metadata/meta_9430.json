        "No one likes to be bored. Two leading psychologists explain what causes boredom and how to listen to what it is telling you, so you can live a more engaged life.",
        "We avoid boredom at all costs. It makes us feel restless and agitated. Desperate for something to do, we play games on our phones, retie our shoes, or even count ceiling tiles. And if we escape it this time, eventually it will strike again. But what if we listened to boredom instead of banishing it?Psychologists James Danckert and John Eastwood contend that boredom isn’t bad for us. It’s just that we do a bad job of heeding its guidance. When we’re bored, our minds are telling us that whatever we are doing isn’t working―we’re failing to satisfy our basic psychological need to be engaged and effective. Too many of us respond poorly. We become prone to accidents, risky activities, loneliness, and ennui, and we waste ever more time on technological distractions. But, Danckert and Eastwood argue, we can let boredom have the opposite effect, motivating the change we need. The latest research suggests that an adaptive approach to boredom will help us avoid its troubling effects and, through its reminder to become aware and involved, might lead us to live fuller lives.",
        "Out of My Skull",
        "combines scientific findings with everyday observations to explain an experience we’d like to ignore, but from which we have a lot to learn. Boredom evolved to help us. It’s time we gave it a chance."

Eastwood', 'about': ['John D Eastwood is a Clinical Psychologist and an Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Toronto.', 'John studies how feeling and thinking influence each other. He is fascinated by boredom and has been exploring the unengaged mind for the last 20 years. His approach to boredom is broadly informed by the humanities, but focused on understanding boredom from cognitive and clinical psychology perspectives. His influential research into boredom has been funded by several national and provincial grants. At York University he directs the Boredom Lab – a team of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral psychology researchers who study boredom. You can learn about the Labs intriguing research findings @BoredomLab on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.', 'In addition to researching the psychology of boredom, John also works as a Clinical Psychologist; providing psychological assessment and treatment himself, but mostly supervising Psychologists in training. At York University he teaches psychotherapy to students in the Clinical Psychology graduate program with a focus on clinical formulation and what he and his colleagues at York refer to as “process guided interventions”. John is also involved in the undergraduate curriculum where he has taught abnormal psychology and designed courses in professionalism, writing and communication.', 'John has a passion for Chinese Tea and proudly displays his ‘Tea Foundations’ and ‘Advanced Tea’ certificates from George Brown College in his private practice. Students and clients often share a cup of aged Lincang Pu’erh with him during meetings. He and his family spend late summer days canoeing Rain Lake and other beautiful spots in Ontario’s Algonquin Park.', 'John has devoted himself to the study of boredom because he is convinced we can learn important things about the human condition by listening to it. The book ‘Out of my skull,’ coauthored with James Danckert, shares those intriguing and valuable scientific insights with a general audience.']}"
