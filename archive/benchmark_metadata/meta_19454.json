        "Tom Knapp has been shooting since he was just 9 years old. Now, over 40 years have passed and he has refined his skills to a level that can be described in one word; extraordinary! Toms abilities with his Benelli shotgun are surpassed only by his quick wit and good old-fashioned humor. Watch as he delights the crowd with fast an accurate shooting."
