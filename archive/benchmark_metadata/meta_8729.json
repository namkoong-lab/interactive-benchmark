        "The Mill is fast-paced and reads like a paranormal crime thriller. Each scene has its own self-contained arc while also pushing the plot forward. Switching between multiple perspectives throughout the novel also builds tension and urgency up to the conclusion. Lloyd does an excellent job of differentiating the motivations and perspectives of her characters. With Chase, she's particularly successful. It's upsetting to read the sections from Chase's perspective precisely because Lloyd forces the reader to inhabit his mind so successfully. He's an arrogant, cold-blooded killer who believes in his own infallibility -",
