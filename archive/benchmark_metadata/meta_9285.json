        "Just as in the European Renaissance where the burst of new information was accompanied by denial, resistance, and regression, reengineering presents individuals and organizations with a dilemma. Participating in the creative process of reinventing the way work gets done inevitably destroys the existing order and creates a sense of loss and an uncertainty about where one belongs in the new order.Corporate Renaissance addresses both sides of this dilemma by providing the tools and methods to successfully reengineer processes and by showing how to tap the creative talents of the workforce in setting the renewal agenda for the corporation."

        "Many view the concept of reengineering-the rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in performance-as the model necessary to improve the productivity and competitiveness of American industry in today's global economy. This latest offering on reengineering by Cross, John J. Feather, and Richard Lynch (coauthor, with Cross, of Measure Up! Yardsticks for Continuous Improvement, Blackwell, 1991) focuses on the design and planning processes. Topics covered include customer analysis, self-study, identifying and designing new processes, and implementing the changes. Included are models and templates for use in the redesign process and short case studies to illustrate the changes. This work should be purchased in conjuction with Michael Hammer and James Champy's Reengineering the Corporation (HarperBusiness, 1993). Recommended for all business collections.",
