        "About the Author",
        "Ian Piper runs a small information management consultancy business in the U.K., advising government and commercial clients on strategies for development of information management systems. His company also builds bespoke Mac-based software and CMS-based websites for a wide range of clients. In previous lives, Piper headed up technology and knowledge management departments in public and private sector organisations. He laid hands on his first Mac in 1986, and aside from a couple of falls from grace in the dark days of the mid-1990s, has been an Apple technology stalwart ever since. Piper lives, and whenever possible, works, in a small market town in Warwickshire, U.K. When not working, his time is spent climbing and photographing mountains and raising two young children."
