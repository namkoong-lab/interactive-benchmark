        "The Contraband Pink Label Design Series gloves are designed as a perfect lightweight glove for women with palm protection, extra grip, and breathable synthetic materials to minimize sweat.",

        "Materials",
        "Vegan microfiber amara leather palm with silicone rubber, lightweight breathable lycra top, soft interior polyester with foam padding.",
        "Padding",
