She’s focusing on managing her PTSD and healing her heartbroken by an abusive boyfriend.She gets entangled in a second murder, that of her mentor and father figure. An idol of the Hindu Goddess Durga is the murder weapon left on the body. Detective Al Newton asks her to look into the relationship, if any, between the meaning of the statue and the motive for the murder. Rekha is attracted to Al but steers clear of him because of her distaste for cops and fear of a new relationship, sticking to her job. The two constantly clash, starting a love-hate relationship. Meanwhile, her family sets her up to meet a suitor, an Indian attorney, who turns out to be a very likable man.When police arrest one of her students, and accuse her mentor of idol theft, Rekha’s dharma, her sense of duty, rears its head, and propels her into looking for the killer on her own. Despite admonitions from Al and bodily harm caused by an intruder who broke into her home, Rekha finds the killer, and in the process, emerges from the cocoon of a protected upbringing, to taste the prospect of a romance, and discover her true identity."

        "\"A murder mystery set against an intriguing backdrop of Indian mysticism and archaeology make this a very good pick.Recommended.\" - Chanticleer Reviews",
        "Rekha Rao lives her multiple identities well. Her Indian heritage is evident in her food tastes, decorations, and family values. Still, she is clearly a modern American woman to whom her Indian culture is only one of the multiple facets of this character. She sets out to solve the mystery despite the realistic fear that someone is stalking her even as she is stalking them.",
        "Dharma, A Rekha Rao Mystery may also provide some readers with a glimpse into the rich religious history of India's gods, rich mythology at least as rich to American readers as the more familiar Greco-Roman gods and goddesses. It's one of the hidden treats that makes this novel an enjoyable read for mystery lovers everywhere.",

        "features Rekha Rao, a thirty-something Indian American professor of art history who faces many conundrums. Her father has been murdered, her family is fixated on getting her a beau to marry, and she's struggling with PTSD while recovering from an abusive relationship. Any of these situations would be cause enough for angst. The last thing Rekha needs is to become involved in another murder and its investigation, but her background in art history may reveal the clues needed to find the real perp in both cases.And so Rekha embarks on a journey that places her squarely on an investigative hot seat. From a cross-dresser whose lies could hide either a hidden impulse or a murder to a suspect list that continues to grow, Rekha's skills and psyche are assaulted by moves that place her in danger and threaten her carefully built recovery from PTSD. As she probes the murder and its connection to an art relic, the idol of the Hindu Goddess Durga, Rekha struggles with her own attraction to the fiery detective on the case, her family's attempts to choose an appropriate Indian suitor as her next beau, and a sense of duty that keeps her questioning apparent truths about the real murderer's identity.",

        "An amateur sleuth investigates the murders of her father and her university mentor.The star of this debut mystery is Rekha Rao, an Indian American art history professor caught in the middle of a violent nightmare. The Southern California-based story opens with Rao being unceremoniously notified by police about the heinous murder of her mentor, archaeology professor Joseph Faust. He was bludgeoned to death with a Hindu goddess statue possibly absconded from his excavation site in India. Rao is asked to assist in supplying information on a possible motive for Faust's murder, but she's still reeling from the devastatingly traumatic effects of the senseless killing of her own father, a physician bludgeoned to death in his clinic just three years earlier. That homicide became even more complex after a janitor was arrested for the crime.But when Rao insisted the accused was innocent and that police reopen the case,they refused. When one of her students is brought in for questioning and then arrested in connection with Faust's murder, Rao knows she needs to work fast to find answers as various suspicions, accusations, and suspects (including Faust's wife and his cross-dressing son) begin orbiting the criminal inquiry. Rao also becomes increasingly frustrated with the general pace of the police-led investigation and, against Pasadena Police Detective Al Newton's advice, begins her own amateur sleuthing, which puts her directly in harm'sway.Rao is an instantly likable character whose respect for her family and her Indian heritage makes her a courageous, determined, reliable, believable, and humanitarian heroine for readers to cheer as she perilously attempts to piece together both crimes. \"My goal to take care of all my dharmas was not a facetious one,\" the protagonist reflects. Her undeniable attraction to the confident, handsome senior homicide detective creates some added romantic tension and another layer of intrigue to the narrative. Playing out over the course of just a few months, the story demonstrates Kumari's uncanny knack for putting all of her characters and crimes in place and tying up loose ends in an economy of pages. Combining Hinduism, Hindu mythology, old jealousies and grudges, family melodrama, hidden secrets, and another death, the novel presents a winning recipe for an absorbing read. While the tale has many plot elements continuously spinning, the academic-turned-actress-and-author keeps a firm grip on the main plot line, which she skillfully and quite suspensefully brings to a boil once the perpetrator of Faust's death is established and the race for justice moves into full swing. Though a newcomer to the mystery genre, Kumari establishes herself here as a writer with ingenuity. She presents a satisfying crime tale with appealing characters who embody vivid and unique cultural perspectives. Delivering a smoothly written, impressive series opener,the author is a new mystery writer to watch.",
        "A polished, confident whodunit brimming with personality and the right amount of intrigue and mayhem.",

        "A professor of art history is reluctantly drawn into the investigation of her mentor's murder, while navigating mental health challenges and possible romantic feelings, in Kumari's strong debut. Rekha Rao, an Indian-American professor of art history at Occidental College, is called in by the Pasadena, Calif., police to identify a statue found on the body of Joseph Faust, Rekha's father figure and an archaeology professor.

Her father was murdered a few years prior, investigating his case cost her tenure, and the PTSD brought on by her father's murder was exacerbated by her ex-boyfriend's abuse. Rekha's recovery complicates her investigation into Faust's early life, as do her mother's attempt to matchmake and her growing attraction to Al Newton, a detective working on Faust's case.Kumari's experience as both a professor and a first-generation Indian-American imbues Rekha with a layered realism. Kumari weaves in Rekha's cultural roots, discussing the art, myths, and traditions of the Indian diaspora, and considers the difficulties Rekha could face in a relationship with Al, who is an outsider to her culture. These considerations add richness to the story, drawing the reader into Rekha's complex interior world as she navigates the academy, her family, and the law.The novel's swift pacing continues unabated through its final scenes. With plenty of twists and turns, Kumari's plot will keep the reader guessing until the conclusion.
