        "A rarity in American letters, \"Holy Week Sonnets\" offers a cycle of sacred verse. Further, this new collection of 24 sonnets by Philip Rosenbaum evokes the last worldly experiences of Jesus Christ and those who knew him, as described in the New Testament. It is sublime reading for Lent, Holy Week and Easter.",
        "The foreword, by the noted evangelist Joni Eareckson Tada, highlights the importance of this book for active Christians. She writes, \"Poetry may demand our intellect, but these poems command our undivided heart. 'Holy Week Sonnets' speak to our innermost being, revealing the beauty and brilliance of our Savior in the most unexpected way.\"",
        "\"Holy Week Sonnets\" describe such moments as Christs entry into Jerusalem, Marthas devotion to Jesus, His Passion itself, and Thomas the doubters conviction. The book, deftly designed by the distinguished graphic designer Kathleen Sims, displays each poem on a right-hand page, with relevant Bible citations printed in red on the facing page. Complete Bible passages appear in an appendix. Hardbound in red and smaller than standard size, the lovely volume sits lightly in the hand and has a ribbon bookmark."

        "About the Author",
        "Working in the tradition of 17th century poets John Donne and Andrew Marvell, Rosenbaum admits his sonnets have been more than 20 years in the writing. Born in Washington, D.C. and raised by secular parents, he attended St. Albans School, and sang in the choir at the Washington National Cathedral. After graduating from Harvard with a B. A. in English, he became a dedicated Christian in his middle twenties. Rosenbaum was a counselor and director of a wilderness school for delinquent boys before he began writing for publication. After an evangelical ministry in California, he returned to the east and now works as a fine art consultant. His previous books, both nonfiction works, are \"How to Enjoy the Boring Parts of the Bible\" and \"The Promise.\" He lives in rural Virginia with his wife Jeanne. They have five grown children and three grandchildren."
