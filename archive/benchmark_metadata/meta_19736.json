        "Jon Terrell Carson loves to worship God, but his way of showing it is a bit unconventional which creates conflict in his church to the point where the members of the congregation petition and have him removed from the church. Jon's Bishop sends him to a new church that better fits his style of worship and the new congregation loves Jon, but there are some unresolved issues at his new church home that cause new problems for Jon.A Man Called Jon is an endearing, light-hearted dramedy, with a fun, yet powerful message of unconditional love and acceptance that will have you reexamining how you look at others and what is truly considered normal."
