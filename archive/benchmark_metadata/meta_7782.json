        "When her carriage first crossed over from her native Austria into France, fourteen-year-old Marie Antoinette was taken out, stripped naked before an entourage, and dressed in French attire to please the court of her new king. For a short while, the young girl played the part.But by the time she took the throne, everything had changed. In",

        "Caroline Weber tells of the radical restyling that transformed the young queen into an icon and shaped the future of the nation. With her riding gear, her white furs, her pouf hairstyles, and her intricate ballroom disguises, Marie Antoinette came to embody--gloriously and tragically--all the extravagance of the monarchy."

My newest book, PROUST'S DUCHESS (Knopf, 2018), explores the fizzy intersection of aristocracy, celebrity, &amp; artistic genius in fin-de-siecle Paris. The book involved 7 years' worth of detective work in the unpublished private papers of its three heroines, the real-life society doyennes upon whom Marcel Proust modeled his fictional Duchesse de Guermantes, the reigning goddess of the Parisian nobility in IN SEARCH OF LAST TIME. My previous books are QUEEN OF FASHION: WHAT MARIE ANTOINETTE WORE TO THE REVOLUTION (2006) &amp; TERROR &amp; ITS DISCONTENTS (2003). I have written extensively for the mainstream press &amp; for fashion magazines as well as for scholarly publications; my aim in all my work is to make my material accessible &amp; engaging to the reader. The image that appears above as my main author photo is actually a portrait of me painted by my amazingly talented friend Brad Livingstone Black.\"]}"
