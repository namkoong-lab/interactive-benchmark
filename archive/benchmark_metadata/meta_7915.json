        "Review",
        "\"There are many books about digital banking but very few from the perspective of the banks themselves. Talk of the collapse of banks due to digital innovation is massively overhyped as banks (unlike many fintechs) have the customers and funding to shape suitable strategic responses. Every bank across the world is taking up the digital challenge and this book is essential to those struggling to understand the subject as well as those in the position to shape strategic responses.\" ―",
        "Brian Brodie, Chief Executive Officer, Freedom Finance...",
        "\"Retail and Digital Banking is a well written and comprehensive reflection on the history and evolution of an ever changing and agile industry that is and always has been faced with challenge and a constant need to adapt. It provides a perspective which helps to position what has led to some of the more recent drivers to changes we are seeing now and sets expectations that once we have successfully navigated the current set of curves in the road, as surely we will, then there will likely be more to follow.\" ―",
        "David Bowerman, Former Vice-Chairman, Citizens Bank…",
        "\"This book takes you on a journey which is both thought provoking and challenges many of the misconceptions about change in banking. It is a must read for practitioners and highly recommended for everyone wishing an understanding of the retail banking sector and its role in the economy.\"\" ―",
