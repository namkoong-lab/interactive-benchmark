        "Delicious speaks for itself. From the moment the Rao family began creatingauthentic Italian pasta sauces served in Rao’s legendary New York restaurant, andlater at Rao’s Las Vegas and Rao’s Los Angeles, creating a delicious sauce madefrom only the finest ingredients has been an obsession. Frank Pellegrino Sr. decidedto take those magical sauces and put them into jars and launch the Rao’sHomemade® premium pasta sauce brand.Rao’s Homemade® quickly became the world’s leading brand of premium pastasauce and for good reason: Rao’s sauces are simmered slowly and made in smallbatches with only the best ingredients, like pure Italian olive oil and hand-picked,naturally ripened tomatoes from southern Italy. Our sauces have no tomato blends,no paste, no water, no starch, no filler, no colors, no added sugar."
