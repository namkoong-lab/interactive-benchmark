        "Here at Aloha, we believe everyone has the right to high-quality, affordable eyewear. Which is why we are very proud to introduce you to Mauna Kea, from our 2014 Pinnacle series of optical-quality, prescription-ready frames designed and crafted exclusively by Aloha Eyewear. Life should be an adventure, an those that are looking for something a little out of the ordinary will find a lot to like in our Mauna Kea frames. These thick-framed glasses eschew the standard wayfarer design for something a bit more exciting, and then further kick it up a notch with their triple-layered color scheme. WeÕve found nothing else quite like them, especially when viewed from the side. Spring-hinge temples and a lightweight form factor ensure you can wear them all day in comfort. Gone are the days when you had to spend hundreds of dollars to get a handsome pair of comfortable glasses. By cutting out the middle man, Aloha Eyewear is able to offer you well-made, custom-designed frames at a fraction of the normal asking price. Simply take your new frames and your prescription to your local optician and have the lenses fitted into your new Mauna Kea frames. If you do not know who to go to, several large retail chains such as Wal-Mart and Sams Club also have optical departments that make filling your prescription fast and easy. Includes a one year defect-free guarantee. On sale exclusively online from Aloha Eyewear, not sold in stores."
