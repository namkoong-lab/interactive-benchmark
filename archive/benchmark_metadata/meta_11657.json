        "The Star Filterfrom Tiffencreates multiple points of light, or \"stars,\" streaking outward from a central light source. This filter comes in a rotating mount for critical placement of the star effect. Wedding photographers will especially appreciate the value of this filter. When it comes to special effects shots, why not offer your client a table shot of the menu or invitation next to a glowing, star-filled candle? Shooting at night? Make that street lamp take on a different, more dramatic appearance by using the star filter. Any point light source will achieve the effect. Tiffen's ColorCore glass is produced through a process that entails permanently laminating the filter material in between two pieces of optical glass that are ground flat to tolerances of a ten-thousandth of an inch, then mounting them in precision aluminum rings. Note:With an 8 point filter, the many star lines may tend to overpower the rest of the image, so use it carefully. Generally, mid-range apertures or larger are sufficient to achieve a good star effect. Always test before critical situations.",
