        "REESE Towpower adapters allow for quick conversion of different trailer wiring connectors. This particular adapter is designed to convert a 7-way blade connector to 6-pin trailer connector with brakes on the center pin. It's the fastest and easiest way to make electrical connections when pulling a trailer that has a different wiring configuration than the vehicle. The rugged construction will offer years of trouble-free service and the compact design allows for convenient storage when not in being used to pull a trailer."
