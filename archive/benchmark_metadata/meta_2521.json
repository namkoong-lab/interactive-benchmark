        "Destiny calls. Soulmates draw closer. One woman stands in the way.",
        "Beth trusts her psychic senses. So when her birthday visit to a daytime TV talk show takes a weird turn, she knows something is wrong. Amelia, the celebrity on stage, is oddly fixated on Beth and the man with the microphone is hauntingly familiar. Things become even stranger when she buys a tarot deck, and they are all pictured in the cards.",
        "Jonan has waited an eternity to be with the woman who haunts his dreams. When he finally sees her at the TV studio, he hopes life with his soulmate is within reach. But as Amelia refuses to let go of their past together, his hopes fade.",
        "Amelia stands between Beth and Jonan. Spinning tales of supernatural threats to her adoring fan base, she builds a personality cult through fear of the paranormal. As her power grows, she does her best to scare Beth away from Jonan and plans to reclaim him for herself.",
        "United by a destiny that spans lifetimes, Beth and Jonan are determined to stop Amelia’s fear-mongering. But Amelia has more than one card to play. Even though they are fated to be together, Amelia’s destructive nature may once again tear them apart."

        "'I forgot for a second that they weren't real and were actually figments of my imagination. I always thought I could suss out a plot line pretty well but Martha's writing kept me hooked. It opened up a new paranormal world for me and new characters to love.'",

        "About the Author",
        "Martha is a dreamer and lover of stories who likes nothing better than spending her days exploring the paranormal and intuitive senses, and getting to know the characters in her head. She is a tarot card reader and Reiki Master, and loves to chat reading, writing and all things mystical on social media, as well as posting pictures of her fellow pack-member, Bertie the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Martha is a fiddle player who fell in love with all kinds of traditional music, but particularly Irish, and is also teaching herself to play the Irish Bouzouki. She played her way through her English degree at York and remembers that time as much for the music as the books. Martha started her working life in PR because she wanted to write and in the end she left PR because she wanted to write more. But along the way she had the opportunity to work with journalists, hone her writing and editing skills and adapt to the many voices she was asked to use.
