        "Kensight DAS 1911 Defense Adjustable Rear Sight with Serrated Blade",
        "DAS - Serrated Blade is simply a fully serrated blade version of the original recessed blade. The serrated blade option was added to satisfy many shooters' need for more defined sight picture. Fits certain model Springfield Armory, Colt, Wilson Combat, STI International, Les Baer Custom, Rock River Arms, Dan Wesson 1911s and many others. This rear sight fits the popular Novak LoMount rear sight dovetail cut, often found on many factory-produced and custom 1911 pistols.",
        "Important Installation Notes:",
        "Please be sure you are purchasing the correct sight for your existing slide dovetail. If you are unsure of your factory dovetail dimensions, call the manufacture or do some research to be sure this is the sight you will need. There are a lot of Forums around the internet that will be able to help with this information as well.",
        "THE SIGHT WILL NOT JUST “SLIDE IN” TO EXISTING DOVETAILS. DO NOT FILE ON YOUR SLIDE! Our sight dovetails are slightly oversized to provide a factory fit, and assure you sight will not hit the ground when taking your shot. The actual sight dovetails are larger than your existing slide cut, and this is intentional. Each manufacture has slightly different tolerances on the slide dovetail dimensions. The Kensight sight oversized dovetail will need to be filed and fitted to your particular slide dovetail size. We recommend installation from a competent Gunsmith."
