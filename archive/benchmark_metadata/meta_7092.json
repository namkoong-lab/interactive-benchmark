His minimalist, linear style and witty titles have drawn over 1.2 million followers worldwide. For this, his first book, he asked his followers to write in with their favorite amorous memories. From thousands of entries, he has selected the 50 most inspiring stories, and portrays these sensual, poetic, and often amusing anecdotes with illustrations in his refined signature style."
