        "Many, many years ago, all things came to be.The stars, rocks, plants, rivers, animals.Mountains, sun, moon, birds, all things.And the People were born.",
        "Told in the rhythms of traditional oral narrative, this powerful telling of the history of the Native/Indigenous peoples of North America recounts their story from Creation to the invasion and usurpation of Native lands. As more and more people arrived, The People saw that the new men did not respect the land. The People witnessed the destruction of their Nations and the enslavement of their people. The People fought hard, but eventually agreed to stop fighting and signed treaties.",
        "Many things changed and became more difficult, but The People continued to farm and create crafts. They remembered and told their children, \"You are Shawnee. You are Lakota. You are Pima. You are Acoma... You are all these Nations of the People.\" The People held onto their beliefs and customs and found solidarity with other oppressed people. And despite struggles against greed, destruction of their lands, and oppression, The People persisted."
