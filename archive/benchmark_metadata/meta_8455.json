        "Literary Nonfiction. California Interest. CALIFORNIA CONTINUUM, VOLUME 1: MIGRATIONS AND AMALGAMATIONS is a nonlinear look at little discussed aspects of the history of California. Hier and Brantingham look as far back as California's geologic past, fast forwarding to the age of the mastodons, then to the time when only Native Americans inhabited this land and finally to the present age. Rather than following a direct narrative, they explore themes that have run through California. One theme is the violence endemic to the state. For example, they write about the brick that struck Reginald Denny. In another, they discuss the California Water War, and a number of riots and civil uprisings. Another theme is migration and how the state's history has been shaped by people following sometimes unrealistic dreams. In another theme, they look at the way that the natural world has affected the people who have lived in the state. Grant Hier and John Brantingham come to no hard conclusions about the history of California. They believe that conclusions negate the complexity of the state and exclude some of the more important aspects of any culture or period of time. Of course, they are not able to capture all of the history of the state either; no one will ever be able to do so, which is why this is the first volume in what they hope will be a long series of books with many writers that extends beyond them. There is no way to completely capture California, but they hope a diversity of voices will be able to give a richer sense of the place."
