    "features": [
        "Anger is a universal human experience. For many of us, it is the single greatest challenge in every area of our lives. We have been taught that anger itself is a sin and should be avoided at all costs. However, anger is also understood to be 'nature's way' of preparing man to respond in times of danger. How then do we go about bringing this volatile emotion under the Lordship of Jesus Christ? Gary Chapman gives us the perfect tool to answer this and many other questions in The Other Side of Love. In this book, he takes a fresh look at the origin and purpose of anger. Asserting that anger is rooted in the holy nature of God, he reverently explains that anger flows from God's holiness and love. Gary Chapman draws on his extensive counseling experience to instruct us how to positively process our anger. This will help us to create and further cultivate healthy relationships. Helpful study questions for group or personal use conclude each chapter. Don't let anger get the best of you. Victory begins with understanding. Now is the time to make this critical investment in your walk with Christ."

        "What's So Loving About Anger?",
        "Many of us believe anger is a sinful emotion of which we should be ashamed. We want to be loving, and we perceive our potentially volatile feelings to be the opposite of love. But as best-selling author Gary Chapman explains, this much-misunderstood emotion necessarily goes hand-in-hand with love. Its fundamental purpose is not to tear down, but to motivate us to positive, loving action that will leave things better than we found them.",

        "SOURCE1: Moody Magazine, September/October 1999 REVIEW1: \"...Chapman wrestles with biblical content in a way that is sound and valuable, illu strated with counseling scenarios and dialogues. Readable chapters are devoted to anger as it relates to forgiveness, marriage, children, God, and us. Especially helpful are the interspersed 'summaries' and the chapter on encountering and responding to an angry person.\" SOURCE2: Today's Librarian, September 1999 REVIEW2: \"Christian patrons and study groups will definitely appreciate this practical how-to guide.\"",
