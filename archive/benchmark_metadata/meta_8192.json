        "Introduction",
        "AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 PM on Thursday, February 18, 1993, I",
        "was sitting in my Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, office at a large",
        "international consulting firm. My new boss came into my office and",
        "said, “Bruce, we are going to have to lay you off.” I was devastated.",
        "Immediately, my mind started racing. How was I going to support my",
        "family? How much severance would I receive? How soon would I have",
        "to leave? Should I look for work at another consulting firm, or a corporate",
        "job, or go back to teaching college?",
        "I was anxious, scared, and angry. I felt powerless. What happened",
        "next changed my life. A lightbulb went on in my mind. “I am not",
        "going to let this ever happen to me again,” I said to myself. “Nobody",
        "is ever going to have total control over my financial fate again. I am",
        "going into business for myself so that I can control my own destiny.”",
        "The experience reminded me of that famous scene from the classic",
        "movie, Gone with the Wind, when Scarlett O’Hara returns at the",
        "end of the Civil War to Tara, the magnificent Southern plantation",
        "where she was raised. She finds that her home had been used as a",
        "military headquarters. All of the artwork and furniture are gone. The",
        "slaves, of course, have left. Her father has gone mad. She is devastat-",
        "ed. She doesn’t know what to do. She’s hungry, but there’s no food in",
        "the house. She goes out into the field in search of food, but it has",
        "been totally picked over. She manages to find a root in the ground,",
        "grabs it, holds it up to the sky, and declares, “As God is my witness,",
        "they’re not going to lick me. I’m going to live through this, and when",
        "it’s all over I’ll never be hungry again. No, nor any of my folk.… As",
        "God is my witness, I’ll never be hungry again.”",
        "That’s how I felt. At that moment, I made up my mind that I was",
        "going to make it on my own. I knew that if I put all of my energy into",
        "building an independent consulting practice, I would be financially",
        "independent and never have to worry about losing a job again.",
        "More than seventeen years have passed since that day, and I have",
        "never looked back. I am not the world’s most brilliant marketer,",
        "salesperson, or consultant. But I have learned over the years what it",
        "takes to make it as an independent consultant. Through a combination",
        "of continuous learning from my fellow consulting colleagues,",
        "trial and error, and perspiration, I have made myself into a successful,",
        "valuable consultant. And you can too.",
        "It’s not rocket science. All you need is the willingness to expand",
        "your comfort zone, learn, work hard, and meet the needs of clients.",
        "You may ask, “To get started, do I need to incorporate, have a",
        "website, a separate checking account, or disability insurance?” You",
        "will most likely need to consider them all eventually, but the truth is",
        "you don’t need any of these things to get started. You need only two",
        "things: a client and a method for finding more clients. This book will",
        "provide you with everything else you need to know to get started.",
        "If you are already an independent consultant, this book will help",

        "to downsize, or your boss didn’t like you, or your employer was",

        "- Those Desiring More Income: A career in consulting can be much",
        "more lucrative than working for a corporation. Think about it. Your",
        "employer is making a profit from your work. It stands to reason that",
        "if you can satisfy the needs of customers without an employer, you",

        "return to the corporate world, but you are not ready to give up on",
        "your dream of making your consulting business viable. You want to",
        "increase your income and make certain you are doing everything possible",
