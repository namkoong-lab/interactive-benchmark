        "This is the CHARTBUSTER CAVS Super CD+G Disk #6 with 450 Country, Pop, Rock and Oldies songs. This DVD is playable ONLY on the CAVS DVD Karaoke system OR on a PC or Laptop that is equipped with a DVD drive. I tested one of these disks in both my Windows XP and Vista systems and the included software program enabled me to play all of the 450 tracks as well as see the graphics on a screen on my monitor. This is a fantastic way to have a great collection of VERY GOOD Quality tracks for a fraction of the price of standard CDG disks. I am listing all 6 Disks in this series so take a look at my other listings and build up a nice big collection for your Digital Karaoke Show. I believe an S-Video cable from your laptop will enable you to hook up to just about any home entertainment system and share these Fantastic Tracks with your friends! I will begin listing some of the tracks from this HUGE collection and I will then attempt to add more of the listing into a review below. You can most likely find the entire track list on eBay or if you google the set.",
