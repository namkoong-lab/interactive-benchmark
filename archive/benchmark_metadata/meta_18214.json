        "New Tac Tic Elbow Golf Swing Tempo Trainer Tactic. THE ELBOW TAC-TIC Educates the Elbow Works fast. You feel and hear it instantly. Fits all. Left or right arm, large or small. Increases swing arc width for more POWER, ACCURACY and DISTANCE. Corrects LEAD ARM BREAK, the most common problem with your swing arm. Keeps lead arm fully EXTENDED increasing the width of your swing arc. On trailing arm, it creates an inside path to the ball formore consistency. The elbow Tac-Tic was designed to give the same type of feedback to a player who breaks down at the elbow. When you watch the more powerful and consistent players on tour, it is evident that they keep their lead arm fully extended during the backswing and throughout the impact position. Simply put, the wider the arc of the arm swing, the more power generated through the clubhead. Many players have tried to keep their lead arm extended during their swing, but fail because they cannot feel the arc, unaware of a break down at the elbow. When a player swings with the ELBOW Tac-Tic on the lead arm, they are made aware of a break down in the elbow by the sound of a \"click\". By practicing with the ELBOW Tac-Tic, a player is given the feedback necessary to help them keep their lead arm extended. At impact, their lead wrist is flat, allowing them to deliver the clubhead squarely and powerfully with a great deal of consistency. Impact is where better players and less accomplished players can look very different from each other. Often less accomplished players break down at impact, cupping their lead wrist, losing power early and decreasing their accuracy. When a player releases the club properly through impact while wearing the WRIST Tac-Tic, there is no \"click\". The Tac-Tic \"clicks\" when a player breaks down, by cupping their lead wrist at impact."
