        "Woodsbridge, New York, is the sort of upscale community where the American Dream is alive and thriving—beautiful homes, safe neighborhood, tree-shaded streets, soccer moms, and happy families. But for Kathleen Carmody, Woodsbridge is something more—a haven to escape memories of her rough childhood and a shattering secret that still haunts her; a place where her thirteen-year-old daughter, Jen, will have everything Kathleen didn’t.   But suddenly, the sleepy, affluent suburb is gripped by fear. One by one, teenage girls are disappearing from Woodbridge’s “safe” streets. Somebody wants what these charmed people have, and is ready to take what they love most. Someone who is targeting girls with long, blond hair and brown eyes . . . girls who look a lot like Jen. Someone who is watching and waiting for the moment Kathleen drops her guard and kisses her daughter goodbye . . .   “If you like Mary Higgins Clark, you’ll love Wendy Corsi Straub.” —Lisa Jackson"

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Overburdened by a full cast of characters and an unnecessary amount of detail, this new suspense novel from Corsi Staub (after",
        "She Loves Me Not",
        ") starts out agonizingly slow, but it manages to keep readers in the dark about the killer's identity until the final pages. The idyllic community of Woodsbridge, N.Y., represents everything Kathleen Carmody didn't have growing up: love, stability and normalcy. But when a young teen disappears and a mysterious figure begins lurking around the field where Kathleen's 13-year-old daughter, Jen, plays soccer, Kathleen fears that her past may have come back to haunt her—and her daughter. Kathleen's big secret remains hidden for much of the book, which is a cause for some confusion. The constant narrative shifts—from Kathleen, to Jen, to their neighbor, to one of Jen's school acquaintances and then to some possibly shady characters the reader knows nothing about—only compound the problem. Still, Corsi Staub throws in several credible red herrings, and though she doesn't deliver nail-gnashing suspense, this competent mystery offers a challenging puzzle and some eerie chills.
