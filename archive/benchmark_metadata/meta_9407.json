        "Review",
        "Azalea Bluff is sci-fi thriller par excellence, packed with the kind of cover-ups and conspiracies that have come to define the genre's accessible side. Dennis Hetzel's seminal effort conjures Nazis, aliens, lost secrets and found heroes in stitching the tapestry of a tale over a doomsday landscape. Reminiscent of Ray Bradbury at his best and reading like a great episode of The X-Files, this is science fiction writing of the highest order for fans both old and new. --Jon Land, USA Today bestselling author of The RisingAzalea Bluff is the rare kind of yarn that transcends genres―part science fiction, part action adventure, and all fun. Dennis Hetzel keeps you guessing until the last, breathtaking page! --Don Bentley, author of the bestselling Matt Drake novels and Tom Clancy Jack Ryan Jr series",

        "Ed Galloway pursued his love of radio after serving in the U.S. Navy and earning a certification from the Carolina School of Broadcasting. He was a respected, popular broadcaster in his native Charlotte area and across the country, known as “the man with a thousand voices” for his impersonations and command of his voice. In 1990, he opened Ed Galloway Productions with a focus on media marketing and advertising. He narrated projects for the Discovery Channel, Bojangles, and NASCAR, among others. Ed’s audio story, “Incident in Mint Hill,” saluted the radio dramas created during the early decades of broadcasting and served as the foundation for Azalea Bluff. He also created a comic 1970s-throwback radio show, “And Then There Was That,” airing on multiple radio stations at the time of his unexpected death from a heart attack in January 2019 at age 68."
