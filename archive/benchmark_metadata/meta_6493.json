        "This product consists of four (4) rolls of fifty (50) Abraham Lincoln Wheat pennies totalling 200 pennies. The ever popular Lincoln Wheat Penny was first produced by the U.S. Mint in 1909. This one-cent piece continued to be minted until 1958 until the adopted the Lincoln Memorial, Lincoln Bicentennial, and Lincoln Union Shield Pennies. The Lincoln Wheat Penny initial appearance was groundbreaking because it marked a departure from the traditional style of United States coinage. This was the first regular United States coin to bear a portrait and not the mythical Liberty which can be seen on most coins pre-1909. These coins would be perfect for a coin collector or history enthusiast."
