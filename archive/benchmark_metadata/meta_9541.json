        "Firefly meets Lord of the Rings in an epic fantasy adventure setting. It's been more than 200 years since the Myst Wars devastated the world. The dragons that once ruled the skies have vanished. Pirates and slavers roam the high seas, and an army of undead thralls and black armored mercenaries, led by a powerful Deathknight General, marches across the lands of the Flaness; killing all who will not swear fealty to the Arch-Lich, Kyshon. Skadi, a golden eyed barbarian woman, Tenji - a spear wielding witch warrior, and Leon D'Rouge - a rogue archer; awaken in the holding cells of a burning slave galleon adrift in the tropical waters of the Azure Sea; with no memories of their previous lives, or how they got captured. After freeing the ship from its cursed, undead crew, the three newfound friends rescue a rag-tag cadre of imprisoned pirates on a nearby island, and set off in search of their memories. On the journey that unfolds, the adventurers find themselves hunted by monsters and haunted by demons they cannot remember, and fighting to fulfill a prophesy they cannot escape. This is family friendly, \"Flinch Free Fiction.\" Written to engage readers of all ages; young adults, RPG Gamers, science fiction fans, epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and heroic fantasy fans. Readers who enjoy fast paced action, detailed martial sequences, subtle humor, strong female leads, complex characters, and rich visual imagery will find this series to be time well spent."
