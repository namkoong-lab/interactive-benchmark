    "description": [
        "Low pressure return lines are manufactured using nitrile tube and oil-resistant synthetic rubber covers and factory-installed, pre-bent end fittings. For late model vehicles, Edelmann offers a special chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) tube with a temperature capacity of up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Mounting brackets are included where applicable to ensure a perfectly aligned, stable installation. If the OE utilizes a non-reusable feature, Edelmann duplicates that feature on its aftermarket product. Heat shields and convoluted sheathing designed to protect the hose are additional examples of Edelmann commitment to quality."
