        "Jesus used food and mealtimes to build community and to teach about the Father, Son and Kingdom. (Some of the numerous examples include the wedding at Cana, the call to Levi and to Zaccheus, the banquet parables, eating with Pharisees and also with persons of ill repute, the miraculous feedings with fish and bread.) Table Fellowship will deal with the concepts of miracle meals, eucharist, hospitality, etiquette, clean and unclean, and others. This volume will help participants to experience and appreciate the eucharistic quality of daily life through meals with family, church and other communities and to invite people to God’s table. This study is part of the Jesus Collection and has 8 sessions."
