        "Designed for Heavy Duty action, this kit is for the Do It Yourself techs. Can be used with High Steer adapter arms at the knuckles. Stronger than stock design to be used with GM 1-ton tie rod ends, this can be used on any vehicle as either a y-link style or crossover steering. The pitman arm does not have flat locating keys, so it can be installed at any spot on the sector shaft in relation to the center steering position."
