        "Double vinyl LP pressing. Death: Non Analog - On Stage Series - Montreal 06-22-1995 captures the band during the Symbolic tour. The On Stage Series collection unearths various Death performances across the United States, Germany, Canada, Mexico, and more. Whether it's an underground, old-school rager upon the release of Scream Bloody Gore in '87, or a tour-de-force in California circa '95 on the Symbolic tour, we hope you revisit Death with us and keep the spirit of Metal alive at this time!"
