        "Review",
        "A Wonderful Autobiographical Fantasy By Books of Our Time on 5 December 2017 A breath of fresh air in the literary world. Honest, striking and beautiful. It has a melancholy feel with a romantic style. The story is woven with original poetry. The author takes you to the many wonderful places Charlie has been and the sometimes complex situations he has managed to get himself into and out of. One has to remind oneself all the stories are true. The journey unfolds in an autobiographical fantasy with Charlie's two parallel lives flowing through the pages.\"I laughed, I cried... I rang my lawyer\" Jack De Juice Flow Productions",
        "From the Author",
        "Goodbye Charlie was 7 years in the making.",
        "I went through a difficult and complex time in my life and thought I would write about it.",
        "Once I started however, I realised I had to start from the beginning, that is, from my childhood.",
        "I also realised I need to stand back from myself, and so I wrote it in third person from the point of view of someone that doesn't really like me.",
        "It was a lot of fun, as I was able to make fun of myself and criticize some of my decisions in life.",
        "It was a therapeutic experience.",
        "It turned out to be an autobiographical novel, with a couple of fictional characters and a plot with a few twists.",
        "You will find there is a lot of humour in this book despite the dark premise of Charlie about to be executed. John, a close friend who is characterised as Jack in the novel, said after reading it:",
        "\"I laughed, I cried, I rang my lawyer!\"",
