        "About the Author",
        "Evan J. Roberts is an author, educator, professional speaker, and mentor. For over a decade, he has coached children, teens, and adults on a range of topics, including: success, achievement, parenting, literacy, public speaking, goal-setting, and much more. He knows from personal experience that many people desire success, but desire alone is not enough. Mr. Roberts is passionate about teaching youth the importance of self education, literacy, developing clarity of purpose, and pursuing excellence in their endeavors. Mr. Roberts' personal mission statement, \"Empowering Youth Now and For the Rest of Their Lives,\" serves as the foundation for the literary works that he creates. His book, How to Become Influential and Highly Successful: The Young Adult Success Manual, has taught countless teens to stop going through the motions in life and the transformation that happens when they challenge themselves to self-mastery. The principles in the book have provided teens with the keys to living with a sense of urgency and producing high-level achievement. Khahari Discovers the Joy of Family is Mr. Roberts' new children's series inspired by his son. This book celebrates family, love, and triumph over fear. It is also Mr. Roberts' way of encouraging early literacy, especially among boys, and contributing to the positive portrayal of African American families in literature. As a mentor, Mr. Roberts works directly with teens and has a reputation for influencing positive change. His mentoring program, Youth Empowerment Group, exposes teens to in-depth success principles, community service, charitable fundraising, and introduces them to influential community members.

He has taught and mentored youth throughout the metropolitan Chicagoland area."
