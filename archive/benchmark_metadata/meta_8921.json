        "First Time in Paperback.Alternate History Adventure with a Twist: Elizabethan England Menaced by a Spain Armed with Alien Weapons.In our universe, Ponce de León is remembered for his fruitless search for the mythical fountain of youth. But, in an alternate universe, his quest found something very different—and very dangerous. After his return to Spain, bizarre rumors flew about what he had found there, and what had come back with him.             Eighty-five years later, Spain sent a fleet of ships against England. The English were confident that they could repel the threat—but England’s fleet was annihilated by weapons shooting beams of fiery light, weapons which seemed to employ the blackest of sorcery, even if they were wielded by odd-looking beings in monk’s garb.             The Queen herself was forced to flee to the New World on Captain Thomas Winslow’s ship,",
        "Heron",
        ", accompanied by her advisor Dr. Dee, whom some called a sorcerer, and an odd fellow named Shakespeare, hoping there to find the source of Spain’s powerful weapons. But they would find far stranger matters there than they had expected, such as a grown woman who had been only an infant a year before, and eerie tales of a gate to another world populated with beings who were not human . . ."

He is a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School and an associate member of the Virginia Bar. In addition to the best-selling “Starfire” military science fiction series with David Weber, he has written several popular science fiction adventure novels for Baen. They include the trilogy comprising The Disinherited, Legacy and Debt of Ages, which combine fast-paced space opera with Arthurian mythology. He has also written the galaxy-spanning adventure Prince of Sunset, and its sequel Emperor of Dawn, the secret-history science fiction novel The Prometheus Project, the high fantasy novel Demon’s Gate, and the time travel adventure Blood of the Heroes. His most recent solo novels are Saint Antony’s Fire, an alternate-history fantasy set in Elizabethan times, and Wolf Among the Stars, a sequel to his earlier science fiction novel Eagle Against the Stars. Extremis, a new novel in the “Starfire” series, this time in collaboration with Chuck Gannon, was released in May 2011. Ghosts of Time, the fourth novel in the “Jason Thanou” series of time travel novels that began with Blood of the Heroes, is due for release this month, and a fifth novel, Soldiers Out of Time, is now in the pipeline. Steve lives in Charlottesville, Virginia. He is married and has three daughters, the youngest of whom he and his wife found and adopted in Russia… but that’s another story.']}"
