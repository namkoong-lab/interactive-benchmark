        "Traditional books on preaching a book of the Bible often look at broad themes of the text while Lectionary resources often offer exegetical and homiletical insights about preaching individual passages. In this book Wes Allen draws together the strengths of these two approaches into a new genre of homiletical and teaching resource with a focus on the Gospel according to Matthew.",
        "Matthew",
        "will not only be an essential classroom resource to help students learn to link text and sermon, it will also help congregational leaders develop exegetically informed cumulative preaching and educational experiences focused on but not limited to the lections in Matthew.",
        "With liturgical sensitivity and exegetical skill, Allen provides a unique preaching resource that will build biblical literacy by assisting both preachers and listeners in understanding Matthew's Gospel as a whole, not just as a collection of vaguely related stories."
