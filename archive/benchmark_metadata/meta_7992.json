        "Myra Moody is acutely aware that there is a flimsy little author man trying to animate her life and her small quiet city in peculiar and disagreeable ways. She tries to fight this mechanism and embrace autonomy, but the author just keeps throwing up endless obstacles at her with his green greasy heart full of malice. Sad Amp at Potter's Field explores the tension within the Moody family and the subtle but distressing criminal undercurrent that seems to be permeating this peaceful landscape. In this experimental piece, RR Hoover examines the value of rhythm in structuralism, ponders the dirt, fondles the sensory glands and lends out a gleaming key to the dreamworld."

        "About the Author",
        "RR Hoover was born in 1977 in decrepit Winona, Minnesota. He gambled and gouged his way through his worthless education and found himself almost entirely disinterested in the world at large. He found some solace in music, began performing and recording with various bands. He has produced over 25 albums, without a single shred of commercial success to show for it. Today he lives and struggles in Saint Paul, Minnesota with his wife Samantha and their daughter Stella."
