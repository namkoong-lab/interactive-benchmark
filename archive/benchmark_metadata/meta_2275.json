        "Review",
        "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
        "Good for everyone",
        "I was never at the top of my class and never had a great desire to study. That's why the driving test scared me...I was afraid I would never be able to pass it. Instead, I made it and decided to write this review because the credit is also due to Oliver King! I appreciated this guide so much because, besides explaining the topics in a language that everyone can understand, it also tells you how to face the exam and it really helps you because it reveals those tricks that are important when facing such an exam. It is not only skills and theory that are important, but it takes a \"good teacher\" who teaches you how to face the whole way through. Thanks again!",
        "(Jeff Sanchez)",
        "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
        "Filled With Great Information!",
        "If you are looking for a book that will help you out with CDL exam scores, this is the book for you. Filled with tons of great information, it includes everything you need to know when preparing for your CDL exam. Laid out in a simple way, it is easy and intuitive to follow along, and is perfectly condensed so you don't waste time learning unnecessary things. Highly recommend it!",
        "(Ash Lynwood)",
        "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
        "Exam passed!",
        "Detailed, comprehensive and above all clear guide. I had already bought other books, but they did not satisfy me at all because they were lacking in the practical exercises part. Oliver King's book, on the other hand, is realistic and accurate in testing because the technique of question construction is akin to the questions that are asked in the exam. This certainly saved me! The theoretical part I enjoyed the most was the part on risk management and prevention.",
        "(Mark Bennett)",
        "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
        "A detailed guide",
        "In this book I have found all the key information that you absolutely must know to pass the exam and obtain your CDL licence with flying colours. I learnt the legal and technical details specific to driving a commercial vehicle, each section goes into detail to cover all the content that might appear in the CDL test, and the questions are followed by detailed explanations of the answers so that you can understand everything. I found it well structured and organised.",
        "(Paola Garcia)",
        "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
        "Very useful and comprehensive guide",
        "For those taking the truck driving test, this guide can truly be a lifesaver! It is written by a professional truck driver, so truthful throughout. In this book we also find the test questions to pass the answers and all the various explanations. There are also lots of suggestions of things to know, such as what to do when driving in a thunderstorm, in fog, in too hot ... and so many other things. Very useful indeed for passing the exam!",
        "(Anna Johnson)",
        "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
        "All the info you need in one location",
        "If you are thinking of taking the CDL class, then you know that it is not an easy exam to pass successfully without adequate preparation. This book aims to help you be prepared for the exam. The beginning of the book looks at the different parts of the exam and what they entail. Then, we get into the info that will be on the test. It is so helpful to have all that information all in one place. For example, if you need to brush up on your tanker truck knowledge, there is a chapter devoted to just that. There are of course the expected sample questions to work through on your own. These may not be actual questions on the test, but they get you mentally processing the information you learned and a check on whether you retained the information. I think this book is well done and will be helpful.",
