        "Since the beginning of the Christian era, the cross symbol has been an emblem of faith. This beautiful cross is a wonderful remembrance of God's promise to us. Along with the Greek cross, this is the most common form of cross. It represents the cross of Jesus' crucifixion. This beautiful cross is also known as the Latin Cross, Christian Cross, Roman Cross, Western Cross, Church Cross, Chapel Cross and the Protestant Cross. Whether you treat yourself or gift this to someone for a special occasion, it will be a keepsake.",
        "According to legend, French goldsmith, Henri LeBeau got lost in the Black Hills of South Dakota in the 1870s gold rush. He fell asleep thinking he was dying of thirst and starvation. He dreamed he saw a mountain stream with grapevines growing on its banks. He woke and walked over a rise to see the stream and grapevines in his dream. In gratitude, he dedicated his life and talents to creating jewelry in the shapes of grape clusters and leaves fashioned in rose, green and yellow gold. These leaves are made from gold mined in South Dakota.",
