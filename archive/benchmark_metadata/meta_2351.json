        "About the Author",
        "Melbournian boy turned Indian writer, Manny Gordon lives in Chennai with his French wife and two young boys. During the day, Manny clocks time in a cubicle, pretending to code software for an IT firm. But in the twilight hours, while the world is fast asleep (or thinking about waking up), Manny entertains himself in the joyous universe of make believe. Larger than life characters. Crazier than impossible situations. King size dreams. Desperately dangerous risks. All are grist to Manny's imagination mill. His novels are about unconventional characters who lead zany lifestyles, becoming in a sense, a reflection of his own refusal to conform and fit in. Manny would love to hear from you, especially if you enjoy reading \"The Double Crosser\" and want to share your thoughts about this book.
