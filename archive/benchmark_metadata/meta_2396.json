        "On her Millennium birthday, Vampire Queen Raina Zharov combats her aching loneliness by purchasing two fallen modern-day warriors from the auction block. Irresistible, green-eyed charmer Zane Ramsey embraces his role as the Queen’s thrall, eager to fulfill her every desire. But the dark-haired, golden-eyed warrior… Exiled Warrior of Exodus Johan Stone suffers a fate worse than death when he’s forced to sell his body in order to save his best friend’s life, but he vows that no one will ever own his soul. In spite of his resistance, he’s seduced into surrendering to the beautiful Vampire Queen Raina Zharov, and the explosive passion they experience together shakes him to his very foundation. Forces him to question everything he believed to be true about himself, and what will surely be a torturous hell of an eternity seeing to her pleasure. But Johan is soon falling in love with his mistress, conflicted between duty and awakened dark desires.When Johan and Zane battle the demon responsible for a series of brutal killings, the imprisonment of an innocent vampire, and their own fall from grace, they’re in for the fight of their lives. Souls will be destroyed, hearts shattered. And Johan will face the toughest battle of his existence—whether he can survive long enough to reconcile himself to immortality…before tragedy parts him from Raina forever. Author's Note: This book has been previously published. The title and author have changed. However, this book is the launch for a new series, and subsequent books have never been published.**Warriors of Exodus is steamy paranormal romance series and contains m/f, m/f/m, and m/m sexual situations. If hotter-than-hell action and dark, dangerous heroes bother you, read elsewhere."
