        "In the desert, water means life. In the Valley of Two Rivers, the canals have allowed countless generations to farm this harsh land. Too much water, however, can mean death.",
        "After winter floods destroy the canals, the farming clans of Serpentgate fear that their last days have come-the time of desperation and division spoken of in the Prophecy of the Rainbow Knife. Mysterious deaths, accusations of witchcraft, and a clash between rain priests and the priestesses of the mother goddess have set parents against children, men against women, clan against clan.",
        "But not everyone believes the promises of the rain priests, and fewer still are willing to submit to their demands. In an act of rebellion, a clan-son sends for one of the Watermasters who once managed the canals but have since been exiled. This Watermaster and his allies must survive a web of intrigue to restore the vast canal system and preserve these desert farmers' way of life.",

        "Dramatic action and memorable characters drive an epic story of an ancient civilization. In these captivating novels set in the prehistoric Southwest, the People of Two Rivers are shown at the height of their glory as they face a catastrophe that threatens to destroy them utterly.",
        "Before written history began in what we now know as Arizona, a vibrant culture of builders, dreamers, and artists flourished there for a thousand years. And then they vanished.",
        "What happened to these people, known as the Hohokam, meaning \"those who are gone\"? To find out, read the Tales of the Watermasters series, a vivid re-creation of the Paleolithic Southwest."

        "Sally Bennett Boyington fell in love with the Southwest during a childhood visit to a relative in Flagstaff, Arizona. Later visits to ruins and a memorable kachina coloring book spurred a lifelong fascination with the history and people of the Southwest.During the twenty years that she lived in one Arizona city or another as an adult, she witnessed devastatingly beautiful sunrises and sunsets, experienced spine-tingling moments of awe, and came to understand the fragility of human existence.Brought up in a family of readers, at four years old she demanded that her mother teach her to read. Three years later, she had a Halloween poem published in the newspaper: creative writing had sunk its teeth into her and never quite let go.For a long time (300 books' worth), making a living with copy editing took priority over writing, but personal changes and recent developments in the publishing industry convinced Sally to share her imagined worlds with readers. She hopes they stimulate thoughts, conversations, and a new perspective on the real world in which we live."
