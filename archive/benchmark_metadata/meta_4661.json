        "Tru-Flate's 13-907 'HI FLO' Aluminum Coupler and Plug Set is designed to increase air flow to ensure your tools will provide maximum torque and optimal performance. Convenient 'push-to-connect' design couplers are made of light-weight T6 aluminum. Kit includes the following 1/4\" body components: one (1) Male Coupler, two (2) Female Couplers, three (3) Female Plugs, and four (4) Male Plugs. Ideal for HVLP (high volume, low pressure) tools like spray guns, abrasive blast cabinets, and other high CFM requirement tools. Tru-Flate is part of the Plews & Edelman group. Plews Manufacturing and Sales Corporation was originally founded by R.G. Plews in 1927. At that time, the railroad industry was the primary focus for the company's extensive line of oil cans. As the transportation industry went from trains to passenger cars and trucks, Plews shifted their focus to developing the tools necessary to service this new mode of transportation. Fast forward 90 years and Plews has become part of Plews & Edelman. Today, Plews & Edelman is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of a broad range of automotive parts and tools sold to the vast majority of mass merchant, retail auto parts stores and wholesale automotive parts and industrial distribution outlets, worldwide."
