        "The battle for Ayda heats up in the second book of The Five Stones Trilogy.",
        "Chase, determined to fulfill his promise to find the unifying Fifth Stone, finds the elusive Captain Nate and brings him back to the island of Ayda, where one of the realms is burning and two more are under siege from Dankar’s dark forces of Exor. Meanwhile, Knox and Evelyn must trust a mysterious guide to help them find a way back, though each has their own personal struggle to overcome. All three children must decide if they can put their own needs―and fears―aside to save their friends and family.",
        "G.A. Morgan, who \"excels at world-building,\" (School Library Journal), introduced us to Ayda in \"The Fog of Forgetting.\" Now, she raises the stakes with a deeper examination of the evil power at work in Dankar, the conflict between love and loyalty, and the pain of sacrifice."

        "Review",
        "Morgan's ambitious plot ties up loose ends from Book 1 while creating additional tangles as it delves deeper into the power struggle on Ayda… This is a strong-boned story that is full of adventure and worldbuilding, and it neatly avoids middle-book syndrome. An adventure suffused with philosophical offerings that will appeal to readers who enjoy rich fantasy. --Kirkus ReviewsThis is a fast moving fantasy novel which will be enjoyed by readers of varying skill levels. A great deal of backstory is conveyed through the story element of the \"fog of forgetting\" which causes the children to forget what has happened in Ayda upon leaving, allowing readers new to the series to begin at the second book and still leap fully into the story. Much of the world-building occurs in the first book in the series, but readers of the first book will particularly appreciate the character growth afforded the young protagonists in this second volume. This vivid fantasy is particularly recommended for middle grade readers who enjoyed Suzanne Collins's Gregor the Overlander (Scholastic, 2004/VOYA October 2003). --VOYA Magazine",

        "PUNISHMENT",
        "The sun radiated sharp, naked heat onto the rust-colored plains of Exor, and the rock spires that dotted the horizon.",
        "Louis hung at the center of one of these spires, like a small insect on a wall. He was shackled at the wrists, his bare feet scrabbling along a narrow jut of ledge to keep his shoulders from dislocating and his arms from tearing out of their sockets. He wore only a rag of dirty linen, tied at his waist. The remaining exposed skin was burnt and blistered from the sun's unwavering attention; his eyes were swollen with sand.",
        "Since the events at the canyon's edge that had branded him a traitor, he had spent the height of each day like this: hung like a sack of meat for the vultures or any",
        "tehuantl",
        "that could climb. The rest of the time he lay in the blessed dark of a cell, deep in Dankar's sunken dungeons, writhing and burning with fever and pain.",
        "Louis cracked an eyelid, looking for any signs of movement or life on the arid plateau below.",
        "The scribes will be here soon to take me down",
        ", he thought.",
        "The desert rose up behind him in striated plateaus of sandstone that hid the maze of valleys, bowls, mesas, and dry canyons that made up the Dwellings. To the north, the shallow depression of a wadi — a river dried up now — was just visible. Louis traced its contours west, imagining Exor as it must have been long before the Great Battle, in the days when the Fifth Stone was harbored safely on Ayda and trouble had not yet reached her shores.",
        "His throat contracted painfully at the thought of water, of the river — how it must have flowed easily toward the sea until it hit the plateau wall and had to yield. He knew that somewhere north of the plateau the wadi ended in a deep bowl — a former watering hole — unable to progress any farther. It struck him that he and the river were very similar: once full and bursting with life, now dried up and almost blasted out of existence. Dankar was to thank for that.",
        "At the thought of his warden, Louis's swollen gaze passed to the Palace, which lay at the westernmost point of the plateau, overlooking the pit-houses to the east and the scribes' quarters to the north. Somewhere between them lay the warriors' barracks, and connecting them all were labyrinthine tunnels and the underground cells where both he and the Keeper of the stone of Metria were now imprisoned.",
        "He had not seen Rysta since his punishment began, but he guessed she was responsible for the generous treatment he received from the scribes. One could not be in Rysta's presence long without being moved to sympathy. They had been coming a little earlier each day to release him from the cliff. Today, they had carried him out.",
        "Even the scribes pity me, and they have nothing to live for but bending and scraping to Dankar",
        ".",
        "He felt a spasm of anger and screwed up his eyes to shut out the sun. It did no good. He saw it anyway: a hot disc of light burning through his eyelids.",
        "Thoughts of Frankie drifted across his mind, and of her sister, Evelyn, and the boys: Chase, Knox, and Teddy. He recited each of their names to himself, and tried to recall little details about their faces. It helped him pass the time. He did not regret helping them, even though it had led to this. His one comfort in all of this was the fact that they were safe from Dankar, hidden by Rothermel deep in the well-protected forest of Melor.",
        "But for how long?",
        "He knew Melor was burning. He could taste ash on the wind with his swollen tongue — and, his head bucked up, something else. Something sweet. He opened his eyes again and saw a sight that made him think he was dreaming: storm clouds were rolling in from the east, casting dark shadows on the plain. He could see a purple mist falling in sheets across the plain — rain that was evaporating before it hit the ground.",
        "Louis was no stranger to hallucinations, but these clouds and the rain were real. He was sure of it.",
        "This",
        "was Rysta's doing. The water was seeking her.",
        "The clouds soon reached him and opened, showering him with a warm, gentle rain. He lifted his burnt face to it and felt the drops course down his skin, making rivulets between the encrusted blood and sand. For a moment he saw once again the white house on a ledge of granite that fell into the sea, and felt the showers of sea spray foaming the rocks. He pictured the little gap-toothed girl in the yellow T-shirt and the snapping sail of the wooden sailboat he used to love. Ghosts from another life, one he had lived a long time ago, in another land, when his name was Edward.",
        "The cliff grew slippery from the rain, and his feet lost their grip on the ledge. He hung freely for a moment, shoulders screaming. The vision disappeared and in its wake crashed a huge wave of despair. He stopped struggling to reposition himself on the ledge, and instead struck the back of his head into the rock, hoping to knock himself out.",
        "Better to die now, roasted on this spit of sandstone, then go on and on alone.",
        "He had lost everyone.",
        "Not everyone",
        ", a small voice whispered at the back of his mind. He remembered the clutch of Frankie's hands at his neck when he'd carried her on his back.",
        "Frankie is out there somewhere.",
        "Louis scrambled backwards on the cliff. His feet found the little ledge again, and took the weight off his arms. The sun rolled slowly to the west behind the rain. Across the desert, mounds of rocks glowed red and beige and orange, and despite his torment, his heart swelled suddenly at the sight of it.",
        "Exor.",
        "He had once come to this island as an outlier, a boy from another world, but he had become a man of Exor. His daylights — his essence, forged from the",
        "atar",
        ", the binding energy in all living things — were tuned to it. He was, he told himself, as strong and uncompromising as this land before him. He had proved this much. And he was no longer exiled here alone, cut off from all he once was and all those he cared about.",
        "Meeting Frankie and the other outliers had changed everything.",
        "Louis shifted on the ledge to ease the pain in his shoulders. He said each of their names again, filling his parched mouth with the sounds. He was not dead yet.",
        "He would see this day through, and every day to come, until he had served his punishment. He would not leave Frankie and her sister and those boys to the mercy of Dankar and the Exorian army. He would not abandon them as he had been abandoned. He would stay alive today and every other day until he found them again.",
        "CHAPTER 2",
        "STORMY WEATHER",
        "Chase is flying.",
        "Below him is the pitched roof of his grandparents' house: Summerledge, with the pink humps of granite dropping into the sea. Then, the arc of Secret Beach, the Dellemere cottage, Fells harbor, and Captain Nate's dock. Out beyond, his keen eyes make out small outcroppings of islands, a house here and there, and then nothing but a shimmering, undulating carpet of blue sea. He flies on, into a cloud bank, thick and cottony. It grows darker and harder to breathe. He swoops up to find clearer air, but the dense air presses down, sending him somewhere he knows he doesn't want to go, toward something dark and menacing. He can't see anything.",
        "And then he is falling, plummeting into that endless sea. He lands hard and sinks into the cold, black water, comes up sputtering, just as a wave smacks into him. Wind is whipping the sea's surface into froth. The water is dark. The air is dark. He strains to see — and there it is: a flash of orange. Someone's life vest. He thrashes through the water toward it. The person wearing it is floating facedown in the ocean, bobbing up and down with every rise and fall of the waves.",
        "Chase swims beside it and rolls the person over. He sees Knox's face, his hair streaming out around it like a halo, his life jacket bubbling up behind him — useless.",
        "\"",
        "Nooo!!",
        "\" he screams. The waves carry the sound away. He grabs Knox by the loop on his life jacket, then sees another orange blob floating nearby, then another, and another. Evelyn, Teddy, and then Frankie. All facedown, not moving. Another cry rises at the back of his throat.",
        "There's a tug at the back of his shoulder. He's being pulled up and out of the water, away from them. He doesn't want to leave them.",
        "\"No — stop!\" he cries.",
        "Then he hears a voice from far away at first, growing louder.",
        "\"Chase. Chase, it's okay.\"",
        "he opened his eyes. Evelyn was standing over him, shaking his shoulder.",
        "\"Was it the same dream?\"",
        "Chase nodded slowly.",
        "He had been dreaming of flying ever since the rescue that followed Knox's disastrous picnic. They",
        "had",
        "all been rescued — pulled out of the freezing water one by one and transported by helicopter to shore — and they were all fine, except for Frankie. But secretly, he wondered if maybe they had died out there in the water for a minute, and that was why they couldn't remember what had happened.",
        "Chase shook himself and sat up on the sofa in the living room at Summerledge, trying to lose the dark thoughts and the strange, empty feeling in his head that just wouldn't go away, no matter how much he slept.",
        "He got to his feet, and with the movement felt a familiar rush of urgency — a panic, sort of. Ever since they'd come home, more than two weeks ago, he'd had this same feeling upon waking — a feeling that he was forgetting something. Something important. It sat there at the edge of his blank mind, like a word on the tip of his tongue that he could not recall.",
        "\"Where's Knox?\" he asked Evelyn, looking around the room, the dream not completely expunged.",
        "Different-size pots and pans were scattered across the floor of the living room. It had been raining off and on continuously since they'd been back, and the ceiling was leaking.",
        "\"Where do you think?\" said Evelyn.",
        "Since they'd been back, Knox had taken to sleeping in his tree fort, spending most of his time in the woods, rain and all.",
        "\"I found one of your mom's knives stuck in the tree out there. He's been throwing it. Plus, he has a bunch of food from the house up there, and some weird mushroomy things. I don't think he should eat them until we know what they —\"",
        "Evelyn was interrupted by a thundering",
        "swoosh",
        "of water rushing through the pipes overhead. Drops of water pinged into the pans on the floor like a timpani.",
        "\"Is he",
        "still",
        "at it?\" Chase groaned.",
        "Evelyn rolled her eyes in response.",
        "Knox wasn't the only one behaving strangely; Teddy was inconsolable unless he was in water or could hear it running. He'd been taking a lot of baths, and when he wasn't doing that, he was running the faucets or flushing the toilets or going down to the beach. Between the old pipes and the rain outside, the ceiling was finally caving in, and Captain Nate, their trusted handyman, was nowhere to be found to handle the repairs. They'd only seen him once — at the hospital, where they'd all been taken after the rescue — and then he had disappeared.",
        "\"We'll need an ark soon,\" their mother had joked, trying to lighten things up. But it hadn't worked. Nothing worked. The mood around the house was tense, and it was getting worse.",
        "Both Chase and Knox had apologized for taking their parents' Whaler out without permission, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was that they'd taken Teddy with them, who was only six, and had ended up getting lost in the fog, which was the thing their mother was",
        "most",
        "afraid of.",
        "Grace Thompson had lost her only brother, Edward, to the fog off the Summerledge coast when she was eight years old. It was the Golden Rule in their house that no one — not even adults — could take a boat out unless it was a bluebird, sparkling day, and never, ever alone. Chase and Knox",
        "knew",
        "this. They had been coming to Summerledge as long as they had been alive. It didn't matter that it had started out as that kind of a day. Or that no one — not even the locals, who were used to a sudden roll-in of fog — could have predicted what would happen. Chase and Knox had disobeyed the one rule their mother cared most deeply about, and they had put their little brother and Evelyn and Frankie in danger.",
        "Their mother was nervous and irritable now, jumping at every little thing. She couldn't relax unless she knew exactly where they all were, at every moment. And she cried.",
        "A lot.",
        "Their dad had told them to just give her time. Chase knew his mother was relieved and grateful they were home, but the interim between when they were lost and when they had been found had changed her. She was very unhappy — and it was their fault.",
        "Chase sighed, wondering again what had happened in that interim. None of them could remember anything about the accident, and now Frankie was really sick.",
        "Supposedly the boat had been smashed to pieces, and the best anyone could guess was that it had sheltered them for most of the time, and they'd only gone in the water at the very end. Everyone but Frankie had recovered quickly and left the hospital, but Frankie just kept getting worse. Evelyn had stayed with her at the hospital for the first week, but then had opted to go home with the Thompsons. She said it was because she wanted her grandmother, Fanny Dellemere, to be able to focus on Frankie, but Chase knew it was too hard on Evelyn to watch her sister suffer.",
        "And Frankie was suffering. She was feverish and wouldn't eat; she had strange lesions around her neck and arm that were spreading to other parts of her body; and she threw up constantly. In fact, the doctors kept her barely conscious most of the time, to keep her more comfortable. According to the daily phone reports from Mrs. Dellemere, Frankie was also hallucinating. She muttered strange names to herself in her sleep, and had asked once or twice about her camel.",
        "Jim Thompson was pulling double duty, between being at Summerledge and traveling the two hours to the hospital to oversee Frankie's treatment. All talk of his new job at the lab had stopped. As far as Chase could tell, his dad was not leaving Summerledge again without them.",
        "Once, when his parents thought he was asleep on the sofa, Chase heard his mother say, \"What",
        "happened",
        "to them, Jim? They all seem so ... so",
        "lost",
        "— and what is wrong with Frankie?\"",
        "\"I don't know, Grace. It's not outside the realm of possibility that the kids might have encountered a barrel out there with some sort of toxic waste in it. I've told you before, the ocean has become a dumping ground. At first we thought it might have been radiation poisoning —\"",
        "An anguished gurgle emitted by his mother stopped his father mid-sentence. Chase did not dare move a muscle, but he heard his father change tack.",
        "\"I don't think that's it, though, honey; otherwise all of the kids would have more physical symptoms. I think it's something else. Some type of virus ... although it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. Some of Frankie's cells are mutating at a very rapid rate.\"",
        "Chase heard a chair scrape across the floor in alarm.",
        "\"Are you saying that she — that little girl — has some kind of cancer?\" cried Grace.",
        "\"No. No, I don't think so. I was suspicious of that at first, but that's not it. What's happening is closer to an infection. A form of bacteria is invading her cells and changing the DNA and the mitochondria. Then those mutated cells replicate with a speed I've never encountered before —\"",
        "\"I don't understand. Speak English.\"",
        "\"Inside every one of our cells is a power center called mitochondria. Mitochondria use the nutrients and energy in food to provide everything our cells need. If a cell were a universe, its mitochondrion would be like its sun. Whatever Frankie has is attacking her mitochondria and — I don't know how else to put it —",
        "supercharging",
        "them.\"",
        "\"That doesn't sound so bad,\" argued Grace. \"Why would that make her so sick?\"",
        "\"It",
        "is",
        "bad. Cells can't survive that kind of activity for long. At some point this mitochondrial overdrive will kill the cells. And if enough of Frankie's healthy cells have been overtaken ... well —\"",
        "\"What?\" Grace demanded.",
        "Silence.",
        "\"She'll",
        "die",
        "?\"",
        "His dad must have nodded, because all Chase heard was his mother saying \"Oh my God\" in a dreadful voice.",
        "\"I'm doing everything I can to help her, Grace. Everything I can. And she's not defenseless; her body",
        "is",
        "fighting back, attacking and killing the mutant cells. There's a battle being waged inside that little girl's body right now, and if we can help her cells get the advantage, she'll make it.\"",
        "\"Does Fanny know all this?\"",
        "\"Yes, but she doesn't want Evelyn — or our kids — to know how serious it is. They've been through enough, and it won't help Frankie to have Evelyn at the hospital all the time. Frankie is getting the best treatment available. I've had my lab see to that.\"",
        "\"Jim.\" Grace's voice had grown deadly calm. \"how do we know our kids aren't infected? Maybe it's ...",
        "incubating",
        ". The boys don't seem like themselves at all. They're so ... I don't know, shell-shocked or something.",
        "Look at Chase. He's exhausted. He's barely been off that couch. And Knox has gone crazy. He's like the guy on TV who eats bugs and drinks his own urine —\"",
