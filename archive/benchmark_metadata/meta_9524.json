        "About the Author",
        "Guy Biederman teaches low fat fiction and is the author of three collections of short prose: Soundings and Fathoms: Stories (Finishing Line Press, 2018), House Samurai (Iota Press, 2006), and Parts & Labor (Thumbprint Press, 1992). His stories have appeared in dozens of venues including Carve, daCunha, Flashback Fiction, KYSO Flash, Sea Letter, Third Wednesday, and Exposition Review, where he was twice a Flash 405 winner. In 2018, his flash was nominated for the Best of the Net anthology. Born in the Chihuahua desert near the Mexican border, Guy grew up on a stingray in Ventura, learned to write in the Peace Corps during a civil war in Guatemala, honed his craft pulling weeds and planting flowers as a gardener in San Francisco, and later received his M.A. from San Francisco State University, where his teaching career began. He's been a creative-writing instructor since 1991, and he's also worked as a bookstore clerk, gardener, ad sales rep, sports writer, and publisher. For 12 years he published the literary magazine Bust Out Stories and a handful of books by Bay Area writers. Guy hosts The Floating Word on Radio Sausalito, lives on a houseboat with his wife and two salty cats, and walks the planks daily."
