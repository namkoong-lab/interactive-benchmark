        "The classic twentieth-century science fiction novel by the screenwriter of the Fritz Lang film, the famed director’s wife and collaborator.",
        "A divided twenty-first-century city sets the stage for this novel of a future dystopia. While the wealthy live in a decadent playground of sex and drugs, workers toil underground operating the machines that keep the city running.   When Freder, the son of the leader of Metropolis, sees the horrific conditions the workers are exposed to, he becomes disillusioned with his father’s vision and captivated by a woman named Maria who is fighting for unity among the classes. Desperate to maintain the status quo, Freder’s father unleashes a robot that looks like Maria to wreak suspicion and doubt and crush the rebellion, a move that puts Freder and the real Maria’s love—and lives—at risk.   “The language of the novel is sometimes as thesauric as Shiel, as kaleidoscopic as Merritt, as bone-spare as Ray Bradbury, as poetic as Poe, as macabre as Machen. . . . You will have an experience in reading that will last you all the rest of your life.” —Forrest J. Ackerman, editor of",

Thea von Harbou’s novel deserves to be recognized as an important work of science fiction in its own right. It’s also a relatively rare and therefore interesting example of German science fiction.” —",

        "Thea von Harbou (1888 to 1954) was a prolific German author and screenwriter. She published over forty books, including novels, childrens' books, and collections of short stories, poems, and essays. She also wrote or collaborated on the screenplays for somewhere around seventy full-length motion pictures in the silent and sound era. Her best known film is the science-fiction epic \"Metropolis\" (1927), for which she wrote the screenplay. Ironically, her novel based on that screenplay is also her best-known book. Only now are some of her other works, such as \"The Indian Tomb\" beginning to become available in English, Although von Harbou was at home in many different forms and genres, the typical von Harbou heroine is a strong-willed, independent woman often called upon to rescue and redeem the men in her life. She was married three times: actor Rudolph Klein-Rogge (who played leading roles in many of her films), director Fritz Lang (whose celebrated silent films were all written by her), and journalist and Indian patriot Ayi Tendulkar. Not exactly a feminist, she nevertheless achieved great success in the male-dominated German film industry, and at one point, she is reputed to have been the highest-paid screenwriter in Germany.",

        "This science fiction classic needs a \"big screen,\" even on audio. The dazzling music, sound and special effects bring the listener to the pulsing, eerie center of the machine-dominated year 2027. With earphones the listener wants more space to hear and experience the fanatsy and eerie reality. Metropolis, a Hugo Award-winner, is best known as the 1930's film prophesying the decay of humanism and self-control. Ziggurat has gone back to the original novel and adapted it to a spectacular radio play. A cast of at least a dozen actors contributes voices of varying ages and styles. The program rivets the listener. This program belongs with Welles's War of the Worlds and other well-loved futurist classics. R.F.W.
