        "BRAND NEW 2K MASTERS! Screen icon William Holden (The Devil’s Brigade, The Revengers) delivers the performance of a lifetime in this poignant action-adventure with stunning scenery from Australia’s New South Wales. Patrick Foley (Holden) is a hard-hearted, no-nonsense loner who spent his life exploring the world and avoiding his feelings. When he returns to his remote Australian birthplace, he is met with more than the average outback wildlife… fate throws him together with young Shawn Daley (Ricky Schroder, The Champ, TV’s Silver Spoons), a recently orphaned, city-bred boy with little hope and even less self-reliance. How can he take a pampered little child into perilous, wild country without risking both their lives? The Earthling is a spectacular, thought-provoking drama, beautifully shot by Donald McAlpine (Moulin Rouge!) and co-starring Jack Thompson (Breaker Morant). The final film in the glorious career of director Peter Collinson (The Italian Job, The Sell-Out), who died at age 44 from cancer a few months after the release of this film, and second-to-last film of the legendary William Holden.",
