        "Award-winning civil rights historian Ray Arsenault describes the dramatic story behind Marian Anderson's concert at the Lincoln Memorial―an early milestone in civil rights history―on the seventieth anniversary of her performance.",
        "On Easter Sunday 1939, the brilliant vocalist Marian Anderson sang before a throng of seventy-five thousand at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington―an electrifying moment and an underappreciated milestone in civil rights history. Though she was at the peak of a dazzling career, Anderson had been barred from performing at the Daughters of the American Revolution's Constitution Hall because she was black. When Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from the DAR over the incident and took up Anderson's cause, however, it became a national issue. Like a female Jackie Robinson―but several years before his breakthrough―Anderson rose to a pressure-filled and politically charged occasion with dignity and courage, and struck a vital blow for civil rights. In the 1963 March on Washington, Martin Luther King would follow, literally, in Anderson's footsteps. T his tightly focused, richly textured narrative by acclaimed historian Raymond Arsenault captures the struggle for racial equality in 1930s America, the quiet heroism of Marian Anderson, and a moment that inspired blacks and whites alike."

        "In 1964, the same year the Civil Rights Act was passed, renowned classical and spiritual singer Marian Anderson, at age 67, sang her last concert at Constitution Hall, the same venue that had been denied her in 1939 by the Daughters of the American Revolution. Historian Arsenault examines Anderson’s life from the perspective of her phenomenal musical talent and her iconic image during a time of struggle for racial equality. He traces her humble beginnings in Philadelphia just 35 years after the start of the Civil War. Her amazing contralto voice catapulted her from singing in local church choirs to a circuit of concerts at colleges and music halls. But her rising stature didn’t exempt her in the 1920s and 1930s from the formalized Jim Crow laws of the South and the informal segregation of the North. After travels to Europe, Anderson was hailed by Arturo Toscanini and managed by Sol Hurok. Not an activist by nature, her preeminence in the vaunted world of classical music eventually led to her emergence as a figure in the civil rights struggle. --Vanessa Bush",

        "“In this moment of change and hope, Raymond Arsenault has gifted us with the perfect book for contemplation and activism. Deeply researched, vividly written, sparkling and dramatic,",
        "The Sound of Freedom",
        "is more than a biography of Marian Anderson, her struggles and triumphs over time. It is a call to reconsider the enduring legacies of our segregated heritage, our culture of disrespect. From Marian Anderson's Lincoln Memorial concert that 'awakened' the country to the cruelties and deprivations of apartheid America, every stunning detail of this bold and heartening book calls upon us to continue the still incomplete fight for liberty and justice for all.” ―",
        "Blanche Wiesen Cook, author of Eleanor Roosevelt, vols I & II",
        "“[Arsenault] excels at contextualizing the concert, probing the ways in which Jim Crow laws and racial prejudices permeated all aspects of African-American life.” ―",
        "Kirkus",
        "“A tightly focused look at the political and cultural events that led up to and came after her famous 1939 concert. It's a story that's well worth retelling.” ―",
        "Dwight Garner, New York Times",
        "“A notable addition to the historical record…Arsenault's book is a timely reminder of the worm of history turning once more. We have only just witnessed another triumphant procession on the Washington Mall, where another exemplary African-American, himself the product of another David and Delia, was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States - something Anderson would likely have been hard-pressed to imagine taking place.” ―",

        "From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by jabari Asim In 1983, a rising young comic superstar named Eddie Murphy appeared before a capacity crowd at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., a venue that had once been the focal point of our nation's continuing struggle to provide equal rights for all. For most of his performance, Murphy declined to mention the hall's historical import -- not unreasonable considering the ribald nature of his material. But just before curtain, he offered a brief nod to history. He told his audience, \"I think maybe like 30 years ago there was a woman who wanted to sing in here, a black lady that sang opera, what was her name? Mary Anderson? This place was segregated. And they couldn't sing here. She couldn't even sing in this place. Here we are, not even 50 years later. . . \" Murphy went on to cite his freedom to fondle his genitalia onstage as evidence of social progress. One could imagine Marian Anderson, the singer whom Murphy struggled to recall, rolling over in her grave -- except that, of course, she was still alive at the time. Nearly forgotten in 1983, Anderson once was one of the best-known women in the country, if not the world. In 1939, her promoters tried to parlay her European triumphs by booking a concert for her at Constitution Hall. She was turned away by the building's owners, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). The DAR's refusal ultimately led to Anderson's outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, the event that history professor Raymond Arsenault makes the centerpiece of his new book, \"The Sound of Freedom.\" Before an estimated 75,000 people, Anderson performed arias, spirituals and a stirring rendition of \"America.\" The program was broadcast over NBC radio, and, Arsenault reports, millions more subsequently \"read about it in newspapers and magazines or watched the newsreel footage in movie houses.\" The concert lasted less than an hour, but its consequences resonated for decades. Mary McLeod Bethune, a friend of Anderson's and perhaps the most influential black woman in the country at that time, noted, \"Something happened in all our hearts. . . . Through the Marian Anderson protest concert we made our triumphant entry into the democratic spirit of American life.\" While Anderson lived until 1993, the concert eventually became a historical footnote. In recent years, however, artists, scholars and writers have turned their attention to that fateful Easter Sunday. Allan Keiler's comprehensive 2000 biography offered a fine, carefully detailed rendering of Anderson's musicianship. \"When Marion Sang,\" a beautiful 2002 children's book by Pam Muñoz Ryan and Brian Selznick, introduced Anderson's accomplishments to a new generation of young readers. \"The Time of Our Singing\" (2003), Richard Powers's sweeping novel of social change, pivots around the concert. Now, in \"The Sound of Freedom,\" Arsenault attempts to revive our interest in Anderson's feat by examining it in the context of a complex and often turbulent racial landscape. And he succeeds handily. By 1939, Anderson was the toast of European musical circles. Four years earlier, the great conductor Arturo Toscanini had told her, \"Yours is a voice such as one hears once in a hundred years.\" She was, Arsenault reminds us, \"a curious mixture of cultural and class traditions -- a black woman from South Philadelphia who not only sang songs in German, Italian, and Swedish but who also spent much of her life in Europe surrounded by members of the continental elite, who vacationed in the south of France, and who wore high fashion and expensive jewelry. In 1938 alone she grossed nearly a quarter of a million dollars from concert fees, making her one of the wealthiest black women in America.\" Her life not only differed dramatically from her impoverished origins in Philadelphia, where she was born in 1897, but also contrasted sharply with those of most other black Americans. \"A dearth of black celebrities and a disregard for black achievement extended to virtually every aspect of American public life,\" Arsenault points out. Only a handful of African American standouts were known beyond their own communities -- Jesse Owens and Joe Louis, for example -- but Anderson was nearly alone in her ability to affect the course of national events by way of a single, dramatic performance. In the battle for racial equality, Arsenault argues, \"the seminal event, when it finally materialized in 1939, occurred not in the ring or on the playing field but rather at the Lincoln Memorial, where a single voice became a clarion call for freedom.\" Post-concert, Anderson went on to devote much of her long life to various causes and organizations, including the NAACP and the National Urban Leagues. In 1954, when she was 57 and \"well past her prime,\" she became the first black performer in history to sing with the Metropolitan Opera. In 1958, she served as an alternate delegate to the United Nations, becoming \"only the third black\" to serve in such a capacity. In 1963, President Lyndon Johnson presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Today she is still revered in her field as the Jackie Robinson of the classical musical world who paved the way for every black star who has followed in her wake, from Leontyne Price to Denyce Graves. But the Lincoln Memorial concert remains the high point of her trailblazing career. Arsenault pays appropriate attention to all of the principal actors involved in the event, including Anderson's manager Sol Hurok; the brilliant black activists Charles Hamilton Houston and Walter White; Harold L. Ickes, the brave secretary of the interior; and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, whose timely resignation from the DAR brought national attention to Anderson's cause. They and others made it possible for Anderson to concentrate on what she did better than nearly anyone else on Earth: sing. But, Arsenault argues, none of it could have happened without Anderson, \"the one indispensable element -- the proverbial right person at the right place at the right time.\" Arsenault, also the author of a well-received history of the Freedom Riders, persuasively compares Anderson's place in civil rights history with that of Rosa Parks, another important figure who also has occasionally been reduced to a punch line in a comic's routine. Neither Parks nor Anderson was an accidental catalyst, in his view. \"They did not just appear on the scene offering weary feet or a transcendent voice,\" he writes. \"They were historical agents in their own right.\" As Arsenault makes clear, Anderson played her part with sustained and admirable grace.
