        "Born Again",
        "includes the most important cases providing evidence of reincarnation, including cases researched by Ian Stevenson MD at the University of Virginia. Dr. Semkiw methodically presents crucial reincarnation cases in easy-to-read synopses, such as the James Huston/James Leininger case, which demonstrate principles of reincarnation. These principles include the observations that facial features, personality traits, talents, and passions can remain consistent from lifetime to lifetime. Dr. Semkiw also reviews the very significant Ian Stevenson twin study case, which shows that souls can plan lifetimes, so that loved ones can be reunited in families through reincarnation. Xenoglossy cases researched by Ian Stevenson, MD, where individuals can speak and understand a foreign language that was not learned by normal means, are also presented. These cases show that past life personalities are retained intact within the soul.",
        "Born Again",
        "is a reincarnation primer that sets the stage for additional cases presented on the www.IISIS.net website, a nonprofit organization dedicated to reincarnation research."

        "Review",
        "Book Review from The Hindu Newspaper: The work has been put together after considerable research and interviews of people believed to be the reincarnations of famous personalities and mediums said to be capable of psychic feats. It is naturally upsetting, agrees Semkiw, for people to see a theory they never had to bother with till now, suddenly backed up by empirical evidence. As for believers, to have one's spiritual belief system exposed so glaringly to the spotlight, dissected, documented and cross-referenced, is not such a comfortable feeling either. The aim really is to start a revolution in the realm of thought. If we all realize that we may return to this world as a person of the opposite sex, belonging to another religion, country, race, etc., we would realize that we are all one and not persecute each other. --The HinduThis is a really good book. I was amazed when I read the reviews, most of them good, but some of them biased by lack of scientific knowledge and religious dogma. You can tell the book was written by someone with an advanced degree (Walter Semkiw is an M.D.), but the book is not pedantic in any fashion. I appreciated the review of work by Ian Stevenson, M.D. who passed in 2007. The book involves case studies of reincarnation evidence and I appreciated how systematic it was in laying out case evidence. The topic is not something you can do a double blind controlled study on. The book does not ask that the reader have faith, but simply presents case evidence. Dr. Semkiw's summary of reincarnation acceptance in Christianity, Judaism and Islam was spot on and consistent with my studies of the topic. The concept of reincarnation has been around a long time in various cultures all over the world. It has been a part of our major religions for a long time. Why the concept scares some people is beyond me. One of the most important ramifications of reincarnation is that if a person realized they have lived other lives involved in other religions, or in another race or gender, they might also realize that to hate another race or a member of another religion or gender is tantamount to hating yourself. I know it looks like there are billions of us here, but really there is only one of us here. To paraphrase a really famous guy: Whatsoever you do unto the least of these you do also unto to Me. Not only is this book caring and intelligent, it took guts for a professional to take the risk of writing it, but there are an increasing number of people willing to do this sort of work. --Amazon.comI am happy with the information provided in this book.It showed a variety of reincarnation cases that I was interested in reading about. --Amazon.com",
