        "Uprising in the world of 1967; Upheaval in a Bronx home!A lively story set in the Bronx, in a time of conflicting emotions—light-hearted expressions of freedom, and angry displays of turbulence. In this Italian-American household, young mother, Maria, married to grumpy Luigi who is fifteen years older, searches for a way out of her stale life; while her daughter, Angelina, a typical teen, struggles to find herself during this turbulent era. Since the mother and daughter are often mistaken for sisters, problems develop, especially when Pasquale, the sultry Italian stallion enters the picture. Sparks fly and nothing in the Campisi family is ever the same again."
