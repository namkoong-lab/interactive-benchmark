        "Their sophomore full-length originates from home - the longing to get there and all that comes from being there. Each song is a maturation from the band's debut. The familiar catchy melodies are still there, as are the sublime harmonies and wry guitars, but \"Now Or Heaven\" is infused with a deeper, more serious perspective of the world."
