        "Review",
        "Besides being a comprehensive guide to the AT and its supporting services, what I really think it amazing about the new Guide is the way in which David collects and manages all of the information in it. There is an enormous amount of information in the Guide about the trail itself, hiker hostels, restaurants, resupply options, health care, vets, transportation, outfitters, gear manufacturers, water sources, shelters, and so on. This is a guy who is making a lot of phone calls to keep this information up to date, in addition to visiting trail towns, and handing out GPS devices to thru-hikers who send him back coordinates to include in the book. I know some map makers, and trust me, this kind of information management is an art form. On top of keeping all of this data organized, accurate and linked together (map and GPS coordinates, elevation data and town services), David is invested in making the Guide easy to use and read, applying the visual principals of Edward Tufte to the display and organization of the information on the page. It shows. --Sectionhiker.com",
