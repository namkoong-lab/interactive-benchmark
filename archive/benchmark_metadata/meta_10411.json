        "Before Tim Buckley got carried away with jazz rhythms in the '70s, he made profoundly moving folk-rock albums that showcased his stunning vocal range, thoughtful lyrics, and penchant for occasionally imbuing tracks with surprisingly soulful, non-blue-eyed grooves and infectious jangle-pop melodies.",
        "Goodbye and Hello",
        ", his second album (recorded in 1967 when he was only 20), runs the gamut. Here Buckley hints at the sensual howl that would blossom in the '70s (\"I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain,\" \"Pleasant Street,\" \"Hallucinations\"). While he goes into hippie-poet-deep-thinker mode on a few songs, the excellent folk-soul tracks win out.",
