        "From the Back Cover",
        "Living a life with no responsibilities and nowhere you have to be, might sound like a dream come true to many people, but not to Heather Moore. Sitting in a dark house, waiting to hear her deceased father's voice, was driving her crazy. But where do you go when you have nowhere you have to be? Daniel Bradshaw travels the country restoring historic buildings for a living. Daniel wants to inspire others to value the past instead of bulldozing it over. On the coast of California nestled between Los Angeles and San Francisco is the quaint village of Crescent Bay. Once it had been an active port for smugglers trying to avoid the high tariffs of legitimate ports of call. Now it serves as a tourist destination for those seeking cute shops, seaside relaxation and nautical history.Part of Crescent Bay's history sits on the outskirts of the village, an abandoned lighthouse overlooking the cliffs. It is said that on foggy nights you can see the wispy figure of a woman standing on the gallery of the lighthouse, searching the sea. Some even claim that they have seen her jump over the edge and plunge screaming to her death. Heather and Daniel land in Crescent Bay, Heather in search of direction and Daniel to bring the lighthouse's past back to life. But sometimes the past wants to be left alone.",
        "About the Author",
        "As a child, Robin Wainwright's Irish mother filled Robin's active imagination with stories of magic and the wee people.  Her days were filled with other worlds where magic and the paranormal were an accepted way of life. As soon as Robin learned how to write, she continued her mother's tradition of storytelling. She shared her stories with her mother, but no one else.",
        "In 2013, Robin decided to begin sharing her stories with a broader audience and so The Widow's Walk trilogy was born.  Robin lives in Southern California with her wonderful husband, two cats, and frequently embarrassed son.  She loves the rain, thunder and lightning (although she doesn't see much of it where she lives) as well as chocolate, coffee, and Halloween.  She continues to write (sometimes with the help of her cats) while sitting in her recliner, appearing to look out her window into her green yard, while in reality her vision is focused on other locales.",
