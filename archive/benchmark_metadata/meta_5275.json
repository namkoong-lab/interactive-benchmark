        "Whether you’re driving across the country or just parked at the office, damaging UV rays are attacking your dashboard and drying it out. The best line of defense against the inevitable cracking, fading and blistering is the Coverking Polycarpet Dash Cover. Tailored for a perfect fit, the Molded Coverking Dash Cover delivers complete coverage for maximum protection against the sun. Plus, Dash Covers help keep your cockpit cooler on warm summer days.",
        "As rugged as the sun is bright, your Coverking Molded Polycarpet Dash Cover is made from a polyester material that’s soft yet strong with a thermo-formed backing. It comes in a wide array of color options to match or accent your interior, and it installs fast with Velcro™.",
        "A Superior Fit",
        "Coverking's true Custom Molded Dash Covers are made-to-order specifically for your vehicle. Every pattern is designed specifically for your make, model, year, and options. We have no ‘one size fits all’ dash covers. Your dashboard has been analyzed by Coverking engineers using state-of-the-art 3D scanning equipment. The custom pattern is tested for precise fit and durability. You are guaranteed a great fit with Coverking's Dash Cover.",
        "Perfectly Engineered",
        "Modern vehicle dashboards are complex, with subtle curved shapes, trays, cupholders, sensors, airbag cutouts, and other considerations. It is common for dashcover manufacturers to take a short-sighted approach to the pattern design, and make a mediocre fitting pattern. Addressing the curves, sensors and cutouts results in a significant amount of time designing the pattern and later cutting and sewing the Custom Dash Cover in production. Because of this, many Custom Dash Cover manufacturers cut corners and produce a Custom Dash Cover which covers sensors, cupholders, and doesn't address some of the contours of the dashboard. At best, this produces a poor fit. At worst, it is a dangerous hazard which can prevent automatic headlights from functioning and airbags from deploying. With a full time staff of professional pattern makers and advanced computer aided design (which was pioneered in the custom auto accessory field be Coverking 25+ years ago), Coverking has the tools to assure a consistent, perfect fitting Custom Dash Cover. All Coverking Custom Dash Cover patterns are CAD designed from the original vehicle dashboard using sophisticated software. The process of making a Custom Dash Cover pattern takes upwards of 2 weeks but results in a perfect compliment to the original vehicle's dashboard. All cutouts, sensors, cupholders and airbag openings are studied and the Custom Dash Cover is designed not to interfere.",
        "Easy to Install",
        "Installation is simply aligning the cover on your dash and using the included Velcro™ attachments in valleys or wherever your cover needs to be secured. After a few days in the sun, your Custom Dash Cover will lay as designed and blend into your interior.",
        "Warranty & Satisfaction Guarantee",
        "Custom Dash Covers come with a standard 1-year warranty against any defects in workmanship and materials. If a product fails under normal use during the warranty period, Coverking will repair or replace the product."
