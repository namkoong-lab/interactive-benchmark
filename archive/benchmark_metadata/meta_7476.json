        "Once upon a time in Harlem there was a man named, John Williams that single-handedly conspired and plotted to eliminate all of his competition on the uptown streets. Through the use of brute force and calculated moves, he was able to control all illegal activity from numbers to the drug trade. John was an intelligent thinker, manipulative and cunning. And as those that crossed him would find out, he was a cold-blooded killer as well. But, John wasn t always that man. When he moved from South Carolina with his younger brother Sam, he had dreams of escaping the racism that was a prevalent in the south, in order to provide a better life for his family. But, what he quickly found out was that racism still existed in the north, and the opportunity well had also dried up. With his back against the wall and no money in his pockets, John concocted a scheme to rob a local hustler that went horribly wrong. Blood was now on his hands...and a price was on his head. The events that transpire from that moment on will have John and Sam pitted against some of Harlem s most notorious gangsters. With their lives on the line, sacrifices will have to be made. John has dreams of providing a better life for his family, but at what cost? Will he and Sam be lured in by the sex, drugs, money and other dangers of the uptown streets? Only time will tell.",
