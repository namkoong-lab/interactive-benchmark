        "In these wide-ranging tales from a life on the road, Vietnam vet and “adventure eater” Richard Sterling takes the reader deep into the heart of cultures, from Asia to Africa to North America. Whether breaking bread with a murderer in the Baja desert or enjoying a shipboard dalliance with a mysterious new acquaintance on the South China Sea, Sterling’s faith in humanity is continually renewed through the sharing of food, drink, and passion. Provocative and testosterone-edged, his writing is also poignant and hilarious."

        "From Library Journal",
        "Sterling, who has authored or edited numerous travel books, including Lonely Planet World Food: Spain, Vietnam, and Hong Kong, is a veteran of the Vietnam War and seven navy tours of duty. He also possesses itchy feet, strong sea legs, and an iron digestive tract. His tales of naval escapades and civilian adventures are abundantly laced with testosterone, well soaked with beer, and occasionally spiced with bordellos. In his latest writing endeavor, he shares some of his most memorable travel experiences, such as eating meals of potato bugs and fiery chilies, baiting pickpockets in Saigon, transferring nuclear weapons in the South China Sea (heroically ignoring wounds received in the process), and dancing with headhunters in Borneo. Locations shift erratically from Baja, CA, to Southeast Asia, Europe, India, and Africa, and the writing style swings wildly from the swaggering to the sophisticated, with many of the stories seemingly more fantasy than fact. Both scattered and scatty, this collection of tales will appeal to the Walter Mittys of the world. With a cover that recalls pulp fiction of the Thirties and a trade paper format, it is a questionable purchase for most libraries. Janet Ross, formerly with Washoe Cty. Lib.
