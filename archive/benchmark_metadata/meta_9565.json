Of his first novel, SINGER OF SOULS, SFWA Grandmaster Anne McCaffrey said, \"One of the best first novels I have ever read.\" Of his later works, Hugo Award winning author Naomi Kritzer said, \"No one writes bastard-son-of-a-bitch characters as brilliantly as Adam Stemple.\"', 'Like most authors, his life experience is broad and odd. He spent 20 years on the road with a variety of bands playing for crowds of between 2 and 20,000 people. He ran a poker training site. He worked in a warehouse. He picked corn. He traded options and demoed houses. He drove pizzas for nine months in 1986, which for 27 years was the longest he\\'d ever been employed. He has been sober for over 15 years. He published his first book at the age of 16, \"The Lullaby Songbook,\" which he arranged the music for. His mother is a famous children\\'s book author. His children are artistic. His wife is a better person than him in nearly all regards.']}"
