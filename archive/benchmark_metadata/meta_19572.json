        "It's double the excitement and twice the fun when identical twins kick their way to soccer superstardom in this feel-good family adventure co-starring Tom Arnold and featuring a hilarious cameo by Olympic champion Cobi Jones. When it comes to playing sports, the Martin boys (Dylan and Cole Sprouse, Big Daddy) are just plain lousy but that's never stopped them from trying! And this year, they've made a vow to themselves and the neighborhood bully to lead their fledgling soccer team to victory. But for this klutzy combo, talking big is the easy part. It's actually scoring big that's the problem. Now they're so far in over their heads, it'll take world-class strength, courage and a steady supply of miraculous intervention to save them!",

        "Twin boys Dylan and Cole (Dylan and Cole Sprouse) discover an amazingly talented soccer coach (Bill Dawes) in a most unlikely place when their father and coach (Tom Arnold) is called out of town on unexpected business. The once-pathetic Terrier team rises to greatness under Coach Rudy's tutelage and are soon in contention for the state finals, but their coach's secret past threatens their chance for victory and endangers the coach's life. While parents may find it hard to stomach the overwhelming barrage of pre-teen lingo and at-times weak acting, the overall message about the importance of teamwork and doing the right thing speaks to all ages. Alert viewers will also enjoy a very brief glimpse of Major League Soccer star Cobi Jones. (Ages 4 and older)",
