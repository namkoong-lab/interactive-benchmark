        "Reviewed By Emily-Jane Hills Orford for Readers' Favorite ★★★★★",
        "Have you ever wondered where mermaids live? Well, yes, we do know they live in the sea, but do they live in charming sandcastles at the bottom of the sea? And who are their friends? Who do they play with? Mermaids are fun-loving, mythical creatures (or, at least, we often think of them as mythical, but perhaps they do exist). They love to play games just like the rest of us. And they have their special places to visit to have fun and a safe home to live in. But, best of all, they care about each other. And I don't mean other mermaids - they care about all the sea creatures and the undersea world they live in.Kim Ann's picture book story Where Do Mermaids Go on Vacation? is a sweet and endearing story full of fun and laughter and lots of imaginative, thought-provoking activities. The story is told in rhyming verse that is both lyrical and whimsical. It is also told predominantly with questions to make the young reader think and use their imagination to create a perfect place for mermaids to go - not just on vacation, but any time. As each new question is posed, the young reader is challenged to share their ideas on what mermaids do for fun, where they live, and who they play with. It is even suggested, in question form, of course, that perhaps mermaids have so much fun in their sea world as it is that they really don't need to go on vacation. Or do they? The illustrations are delightful, and I loved the questioning approach to presenting the story. Beautiful!",
