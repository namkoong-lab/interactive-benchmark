        "Rose Lee Jefferson overhears the ladies of the garden club discussing the city’s plans to level Dillon’s black community, Freedomtown, to build a park for the city’s white residents. The plan is carried out, and nothing remains of Freedomtown but the memories of its former residents and a series of drawings that Rose Lee makes to celebrate the community. “Meyer’s moving account is as much a documentary as a novel, with a vividly realized setting and a good array of characters to dramatize issues.”--",

The main character of my most recent book, GIRL WITH A CAMERA: MARGARET BOURKE-WHITE, PHOTOGRAPHER (A Novel), is a far cry from the roundish, gray-haired lady with a needle in her hand and spectacles on her nose. Since the thrill of seeing that first book in print, I've written over sixty more books, non-fiction and novels (most recently, historical fiction). In the process I've learned more about writing and a lot about history, a subject that was not my favorite when I was a young student but has become my passion--a passion I love to share with readers.\"]}"
