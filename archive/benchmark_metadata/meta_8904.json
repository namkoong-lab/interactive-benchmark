        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Stewart's third mystery featuring attorney Tom McInnes (after 2000's Dog Island) again combines the suspense, richly textured plot, picturesque Alabama settings, double-crossing characters and sparkling writing that set his first two books apart from the pack. Here, Sheri Baneberry hires Tom to discover the truth behind the death of her mother, who was serving on a jury when she supposedly died of food poisoning. As Tom and his two investigators dig into the Baneberry case, they immediately run into nightmarish trouble. Tom's menaced by an elusive stranger, violent ex-con Zion \"Zybo\" Thibbodeaux, one of the most complex, frightening characters in recent mystery fiction. Sheri's father and his business partner try to stop the investigation. Influential politicians try to buy Tom off, wrongly accuse him of murdering another lawyer and threaten him with disbarment. The bright spot is Dr. Kai-Li Cantil, an Auburn University psychology professor, whose research contributes to Tom's case and whose friendship and physical allure boost his morale. Eventually, Tom identifies Mrs. Baneberry's murderer, but can he prove the killer did it? Then the enigmatic Thibbodeaux vanishes, perhaps to reappear in another book. A cast of devious characters, most of them hiding secrets that may or may not help Tom, populate this many-layered plot in which answers just lead to more questions. Stewart throws a curveball in the surprising conclusion that will leave mystery fans eagerly awaiting the fourth in the series. Agent, Sally McMillan. (Jan. 7)attorney to write full time.",

        "When Alabama lawyer Tom McInness (Sins of the Brother, Dog Island) looks into a woman's untimely death from food poisoning while she was on jury duty, he suddenly gains the close attention of some very unsavory types. Jeep sabotage, home intrusion, assault, and warnings not to mention the disappearance of his burly investigator and his highly competent ex-stripper assistant create daily problems. Apparently, a well-known legal firm is somehow engineering the removal of recalcitrant jurors from high-money cases. A tense, nerve-wracking narrative, nonstop action, and a tightly mortared plot keep the pages turning. A good choice.",

        "(2000), returns to solve another tricky mystery. Is it an accident or foul play when a woman dies of food poisoning while being treated in a hospital? After McGinnis is nearly killed in an automobile accident and his house is broken into, he begins to suspect the latter. Stewart keeps the reader in just the right state of confusion, eager to know more but never frustrated at the lack of concrete answers. Tom is a solid series lead, intelligent, outspoken, and somewhat witty, and Stewart surrounds him with an engaging assortment of supporting players. Readers expecting slam-bang action will be disappointed; Stewart prefers to tell a story through its characters, not through constant action, although there are some exciting moments here, and the plot is pleasantly unpredictable. For fans of character-driven legal thrillers--such as those written by Phillip Margolin, John Lescroart, and Scott Turow--this one's a definite keeper.",
