        "Just when you thought it was safe to go in the sewer… Deep in the sewers beneath the city of Regent Park, a baby alligator feeds on the experimental animals discarded by Future Chemicals Corporation. Nourished by the toxic growth hormones and other mutating chemicals, the gator grows immense in size…and voracious in appetite. Now, it must kill to survive! It's a classic confrontation between man and beast. This sequel to the classic thriller Alligator stars Joseph Bologna (Transylvania 6-5000), Steve Railsback (Lifeforce), Dee Wallace (The Howling), Richard Lynch (Bad Dreams) and Kane Hodder (Jason X).",
