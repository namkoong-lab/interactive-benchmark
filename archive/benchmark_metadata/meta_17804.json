This increased friction - heating causes faulty operations (jamming) and also reduces operational life (break-downs). Size: 11 ounce Gun lubricant & protectant Release agent lifts rust, dirt, grime, grease and even drives out moisture Lube does not attract dust, dirt, powder residue and it does not sling off moving parts Non-petroleum greaseless qualities retard gum-up or build-up Provides lubrication between closely positioned ultra fast moving parts Superior clean lubrication reduces heating and friction for longer durations Neutralizes finger acid and protects expensive metal s"
