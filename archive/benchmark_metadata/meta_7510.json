        "In this first book of poetry, Shelly Smith welcomes us into the magic of everyday life as seen through the eyes of the healer and mystic. Her poems reflect her intimate relationship with nature and the spiritual lessons to be found there. She invites us to relax into the beauty of our earthly home, allowing it to quench our spiritual thirst. With unselfconscious clarity, she writes about aging, self-worth, and living life as a highly sensitive person – often delivering insights that cut straight to the heart. How She Heals offers spiritual guidance for dealing with these and other life challenges, with Nature as our finest example and teacher."
