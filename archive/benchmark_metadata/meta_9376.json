        "Who hasn't dreamt of living in France? For Susie that dream comes true... ...but not in the way she had imagined.",
        "Yes, the countryside is spacious and peaceful.... ...on summer nights the stars skim the rooftops, the owls hoot and the nightingales sing. Sunflowers smile from their fields. Then there's the food and the wine... ...the wine is cheap and the baguettes are crusty. The French neighbours are generous and gentle.But then come the drug addicts, builders who cannot build, demanding compatriots, undercover cops and unwelcome guests.Susie begins to lose hope of attracting the fabled French philanderer and, far from appreciating their new home, the animals do everything they can to make life as difficult as possible.With her house literally crumbling around her, the number of odd characters Susie manages to attract are only matched by the assortment of creatures appearing from in and out of the woodwork.When her husband almost dies, Susie's resilience and good humour are tested to the limit.",
        "Sometimes it feels more like taking part in a musical comedy than starting a new life in France.",

        "About the Author",
        "Born a Londoner, Susie Kelly spent most of the first 25 years of her life in Kenya. She now lives in south-west France with her husband and assorted animals. She believes that her explosive temper is a legacy from her Irish-American grandfather, but has no idea who to blame for her incompetence as a housewife. Still, she's very kind to animals, small children and elderly people. Susie particularly enjoys exploring the road less travelled, discovering the lives and events of lesser-known places.Prior to publishing with Blackbird, Susie was with Transworld who sold over 50,000 of her titles in the UK. Some of those are rights-reverted and are now available to readers worldwide for the first time.",
