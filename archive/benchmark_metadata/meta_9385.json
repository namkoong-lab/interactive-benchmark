        "\"You have a message from......BEEEEEP\" Do you remember when the internet chatrooms were the place to be? The virtual world of internet dating chatrooms was where many went to get their freak on. Some chose the more direct route that was offered in the many by-the-minute phone chatlines that were advertised on BET after midnight, or on the back pages of the XXL magazine. If you can remember those days, then you can surely relate to this story. •Divine is new to Atlanta, and even though he doesn't know anyone, he knows from experience that the quickest way to meet women in any state is to jump in a chatroom or to dial into a chatline. Travel with Divine as jumps in and out of chatrooms & chatlines......and relationships. This story is hot. It is funny. It is serious.....and it is real."

        "This book is burning the ladies panties. It is a page-turner and is full of erotic fantasies and emotions. It's a story that can not be put down until the end and then you want to read it over. The romance and lust of the story are overpowering. Divine's ghetto swag rivets the pages and riddle the scenes match to perfection.... Definitely a good read if you like lusty, steamy romance.",

        "is a great read....you get more than expected from other urban erotica books.. Divine is definitely a young man living on the edge....he has no restrictions and just about anyone can get it. I'm surprised there weren't any visits to the std clinic..joke. in this book. I was able to take a walk on the wild side and see that some men really would sex anything but his experiences enhance the story. There were parts in the book that made me laugh until tears fell from my eyes and I awakened my family....this book is definitely recommended by CHARNESE THE BOOK CRITIC DC",
        "About the Author",
        "Divine Ortiz is a 49-year-old Puerto Rican originally from The Bronx, NY. He's spent most of his life as a member of the Five Percent Nation, and a third of his life in and out of various state and federal penitentiaries. It was during his last prison term in a Federal United States Penitentiary that he decided that it would indeed be his last. Recognizing that he had a gift for writing, he picked up a pen. Five and a half years and 17 novels later, Divine emerged from the federal prison system with a story to tell and a plan. After a couple of not so great experiences with shady publishers, Divine chose to take control of the direction his books and career would go. He, along with his wife, Nikki Ortiz created ZitrO Publications. With over 50 books published to their credit, an arsenal of top-notch authors signed to ZitrO and no end in sight, ZitrO Publications has forged its way into the literary world. Like it or not, Urban Fiction and the literary world have a new face. One that threatens to be around for a long time to come.
