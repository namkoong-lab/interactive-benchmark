        "Lucasi Custom LZC39 mystic black billiard cue with Cocobolo and Bocote long and short inlay points bordered by imitation bone, imitation bone skinny diamonds, stacked silver/Bocote/silver bands sandwiching thick rengas rings, solid black genuine leather wrap, Uni-loc quick-release joint with Implex collar and upgraded Lucasi Custom Solid Core Low Deflection Technology Shaft. This new 12.75mm shaft blends technology enhancements (the wildly popular Zero Flexpoint ferrule and new taper designed by two-time World Champion Thorsten Hohmann) with old-school solid Maple construction and your favorite premium Everest tip to give you a shaft that plays like new, but feels like an old friend. The Lucasi Custom Solid Core Low Deflection Technology Shaft comes standard only on Lucasi Custom models and is designed to give your game an extra kick by making each shot you take more true-to-path. This piece has a timeless traditional look with great modern technology features and would make a great playing cue for anyone looking to enhance their game - from an amateur player practicing on a home table to a battle-tested tournament warrior. Lucasi Custom Cues bring you beauty and distinction by combining fine craftsmanship and quality touches with the high performance features you need to take your game to a whole NEW level. It is our goal to make cues that will not only look beautiful, but will keep playing faithfully for years to come. We at Lucasi think quality cue construction starts with quality wood selection. That's why we only use hand-selected premium grade North American Hard Rock Maple for our cue shafts and do not bleach the wood. We want your cue to maintain its beauty and durability for years to come – bleaching may make the shaft appear higher quality, but it damages the wood, making it less durable and more susceptible to war page, yellowing and breakage. Lucasi Custom cues are made of premium grade North American Hard Rock Maple and feature 100 percent North American Hard Rock Maple shafts. Before production starts, the wood used to make each Lucasi Custom Cue is aged and dried for 18 to 24 months in specially-designed moisture-controlled rooms. While drying, each cue blank is turned and rested more than 11 times to ensure the proper amount of moisture. The blank is then treated with a patented wood stabilizer to protect the finished cue from additional moisture and help prevent warping for a lifetime. Each Lucasi Custom Cue features magnificent laser-cut precision inlays for a distinctive look. hand-selected premium exotic woods for a custom touch. Uni-Loc quick-release, radial or custom 3/8 x 10 pin joint for a precise fit. a 12.75mm Lucasi Custom Solid Core Low Deflection Technology Shaft that gives game changing results. a fine leather or Irish linen wrap (or a sleek wrap less handle) to give the grip you want. and a spectacular high grade finish that protects against scratching and fading from the sun's harmful rays. All in all, Lucasi produces remarkable and distinctive cues that not only look great, will also help you take your game to a whole new level. To top it off, each Lucasi Custom Cue comes with a Lifetime Guarantee that protects your investment--even against war page."
