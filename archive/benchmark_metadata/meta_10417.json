        "The Kills debut is a stark 21st Century blues album, the sort of thing that would have struggled to find an audience before the",
        "White Stripes",
        "broke into the mainstream. So its lucky for them--and us--that they had such respectable coattails to ride on. The duo--Alison Mosshart, a.k.a. VV, and Hotel--play a music thats blues influenced with a garage rock edge, and thats where the similarities end. Sure, the Kills use a drum machine instead of a live drummer, but the differences run much deeper than that: The Killss blues rock is dirtier and more sex-drenched version of blues rock, a result of the shared vocal duties of Hotel and VV. The sultry \"Hitched\" says it all (\"Ill get my name stitched on your lips so you wont get hitched\"). These are songs that sweat sexual menace, recalling Boss Hogg or early",
        "PJ Harvey",
        "(on \"Superstition\" and \"Wait,\" VVs voice is a dead ringer for young Polly Jeans). Best of all, these songs are stuffed with hooks. In a sea of pretenders, the Kills are capable of providing some genuine competition for the White Stripes.",
