        "Get Wally",
        "4:35 p.m. An odd time for one of the most lucrative bank heists of all time. Wally and his gang waited outside for the first move. 4:40 p.m. the guards take their smoke break just as Wally had planned. They make their move, masked and all wearing the same striped long-sleeve and hat. Upon entering, Wally handed the teller a book. He instructed her unlock the vault and to find his image on each page of the book if she wanted to live. They were fast and effective, wiping the vault clean of all cash and gold. It wasn't until they were leaving when they experienced trouble.",
        "The teller had radioed the guards. Not to eliminate Wally and his gang, but to help with finding his image in the book she had been given. Now Wally and the gang had to sneak around them. Fortunately, the guards and the teller were too focused on finding Waldo to notice that the real Wally and his gang sneaking out the front door. \"Why do you have this book and who'd you get it from?\" the guards asked. \"I got it from Wally himself, he and his gang are robbing the bank now\" the teller replied. It was too late, Wally and the gang had snuck by and were already 15 miles down Highway 12.",
        "Handle with Scare",
