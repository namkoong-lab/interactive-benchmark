        "Get an added angling advantage with LakeMaster Plus mapping, which adds high-quality aerial photography to its unrivaled accuracy and detail, easy-to-read contours, highlighted depth ranges, and scrollable lake lists. LakeMaster digital maps provide the most detailed, high-definition collection of freshwater mapping in the United States, with unmatched depth contours between 1-3 feet (in high definition) or 3-5 feet (standard definition). This LakeMaster Plus Great Plains Edition, Version 1 boasts more than 400 high-definition lakes and over 500 total lakes from NE, KS, MO, IA, and IL. It includes Banner Lake, Bull Shoals Lake, Cedar Lake, East Loon Lake, El Dorado Lake, Illinois River Pools, Keith Sebelius Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, McCanaughy, Mississippi River Pools, and more. LakeMaster Plus enables you to view an aerial image overlay on high-definition waters to see the entry and exits of creek channels, to see how far a reef or weed line extends, and to pick out shallow-water rock piles, steep drop-offs, and other features. Easy-to-see shading highlights shallow-water areas within an adjustable range up to 30 feet, and depth contours and shorelines can be synchronized with the actual water levels of lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. LakeMaster digital maps can be used with Minn Kota i-Pilot Link (sold separately), allowing you to follow a selected depth contour line to deliver precise, automatic boat control. Collected by Humminbird's own team of GIS analyst cartographers, LakeMaster high-definition maps are created from on-the-water surveys using hundreds of thousands of depth soundings, plus state-of-the-art GPS and sonar technologies. LakeMaster Plus digital maps come on a Micro SD card (with included SD card adapter) that's compatible with all GPS-equipped HELIX, SOLIX, ONIX, and ION Series models and select 600-1100 Series models. Strictly intended for use in your Humminbird GPS unit, LakeMaster mapping cards are not PC compatible and map files could be corrupted if accessed on a computer."
