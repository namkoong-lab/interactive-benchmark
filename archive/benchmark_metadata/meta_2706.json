        "\"I realized that I missed the existentialism that was so present in my younger years. Reading this was like a breath of fresh air for me.\"",
        "\"This is a really engaging story. It's not just about the march of technology into some doomed abyss or the degradation of humanity but also the inner workings of one man's mind as he finds himself wrenched from the fragmented and dysfunctional world he knew and thrust into a totally new fragmented and dysfunctional world. There's a potent psychological thread that runs through this tale and the reader simultaneously sympathizes with and despises the narrator\"",
        "\"A hard look at yourself is always difficult to take gracefully and this novella brings us to that brink and then holds us there while we contemplate our choices. A quick read that leaves you contemplating for many hours afterwards\"",
