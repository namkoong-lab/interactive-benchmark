        "Whether you need to repair your sunglasses or give your favorite frames a colorful upgrade, replacement lenses by Revant Optics offer original manufacturer quality at a great price. All of our lenses deliver both superior impact protection and incredibly crisp, clear views. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sets the bar for eyewear performance with the Z80.3 standard â€” we strive to not just pass their tests, but to crush them. Our lenses feature integrated UV protection that keeps your eyes safe from 100% of harmful rays. We use the best optical-grade polycarbonate lens material that has 2.5 times the clarity of other lower grade lens materials. Unlike competitors who bend their lenses to shape, Revant lenses are injection-molded and tapered to the correct optical curvature to reduce eye strain. Every lens shape is tested for fit at our headquarters in Portland, Oregon so we can be sure when you install them, theyâ€ll lock in tight and secure. Our how-to lens installation videos make replacing your lenses easy. Customize your sunglasses for your lifestyle. From dozens of colors to polarized options, Revant lenses come stacked with premium features to suit your needs, whether on the trail, driving, fishing, or for everyday wear. Contact our Eyewear Experts if you need recommendations for what lens would be best for you. Our industry-leading guarantee has your lenses covered by a 1-year warranty against defects, giving you peace of mind that if something goes wrong, we'll have your back and will make it right. With the option to easily fix your frames instead of throwing them away, you can keep the sunglasses like-new for half the cost of new frames, and reduce waste in the process."
