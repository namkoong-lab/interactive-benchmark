        "Until now, finding reliable information on U-boats lost during World War I required fluency in German and a great deal of time. Not only was little information available in English but also German sources were difficult to track down and provided the barest of facts. Long in the making, this new reference fills the needs both of researchers looking for details of lost submarines and readers who enjoy action and adventure. It provides a comprehensive examination of each of the 203 U-boats that the Germans lost in the war. Fluent in German and at home in war archives, Dwight Messimer offers for the first time individual narratives of the men who survived their boat's sinking. Several made difficult escapes from sunken wrecks, and one man bailed out just as his submarine plunged past the 100-foot mark. Others were on deck or atop the coning tower when their boat went under.",
        "In the case of boats listed as verschollen, or lost without a trace, the author includes explanations given for what might have happened or in the case of conflicting evidence, analyzes the explanations for accuracy. Each boat entry is a narrative that stands alone allowing readers to easily focus on a particular submarine. Researchers will appreciate the convenience of the book's format and the all-inclusive nature of the information listed. Because Messimer provides the approximate locations of many of the wrecks, amateur and professional salvage divers wanting to visit wreckage sights also will find the book useful."

I am a trained military historian, not a journalist or a history buff. I am fluent and literate in German. My subject area is largely WWI, POW escapes, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and German U-Boat operations. I have also written books on naval and Army aviation covering the period 1925-1942. My work has also appeared in The American Neptune (German Gunboats in China), The Quarterly Journal of Military History (German U-Boats), and Naval History (German Gunboats in China, 1898-1914), and in several anthologies. I also wrote the foreword to Gaylord Kelshall’s, The U-Boat War in the Caribbean. and the Naval Institute’s Classics of Naval Literature title, Voyage of the Deutschland. In January 2020 my latest book will be released by the University of Nebraska Press, An Incipient Mutiny:The story of the U.S. Army Signal Corps Pilot Revolt.']}"
