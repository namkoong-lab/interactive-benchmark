        "Highly-Detailed Mini-Crawler!: In 2019 the world's most popular mini RC series, known as the Kyosho MINI-Z, celebrated more than 20 years of unmatched performance and scale realism in the hobby-grade RC category. The continuous pursuit of performance and evolution has led to the creation of a completely-new ‘MINI-Z 4x4’ design that delivers an all-new driving experience for RC fans of all stripes, with superior overall design, driving performance and high-quality injection-molded scale body construction. A significant feature of the MINI-Z 4x4 series is the greater emphasis of body detail and quality of finish that even surpasses existing benchmarks set by the MINI-Z. The body is also molded with thicker material to better resist crash damage from operation in rough terrain. Incorporating the same ladder- style frame of real 4WD vehicles, the MINI-Z 4x4 boasts a 3-link rigid axle suspension combining what would normally be two upper links into a single upper A-arm to deliver maximum suspension movement. A specially designed high-torque steering servo enables this machine to throw its elbows around in the hard terrain for excellent performance in the toughest rock-crawler conditions. The high-torque 130-size motor brings out the beast in the MINI-Z 4x4, specially geared to run well in the low to medium speed ranges common in crawling. Designed to balance exquisite style, scale detail and superior driving performance, all the MINI-Z 4x4 needs is 8 x AAA alkaline batteries (sold separately). Enjoy driving under any conditions, from normal driving to rock crawling while appreciating the stunning visual appearance. The Kyosho Mini-Z 4x4 is the only mini crawler that delivers a full range of crawling performance in a smaller package"
