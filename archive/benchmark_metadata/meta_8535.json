        "Wayne Braudrick s engaging book takes you to the heart of what it really means to be a man: the practices that enable men to be reliable, focused, responsible, chivalrous, wise, loyal, and authentic servant lead-ers. In this lively and readable book, Braudrick is the superb mentor that makes a convincing case for genuine manhood. --Tom Siems, Ph.D., Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of DallasManhood is enlightening and hopeful for men everywhere! Despite living in a culture that minimizes masculinity, Dr. Braudrick shows us example after example of what the biblical definition is of a real man. Gripping, applicable and full of encouragement Manhood provides steps that every man can take to finally become who God has created him to be! --John McKinzie, Lead Pastor at Hope Fellowship ChurchesWayne Braudrick has done the body of Christ a great service in writ-ing this thoroughly biblical and highly engaging book about manhood. One would be challenged to find a more relevant book for our times. The best thing about it: One cannot read it without being transformed by its message. This book is highly recommended! --Ron Rhodes, Th.D., Author and Professor",
