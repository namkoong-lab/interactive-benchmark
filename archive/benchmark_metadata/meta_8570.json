His family moved to Montgomery when he was six years old. Steve’s childhood dream was to be an oceanographer. He always wanted to learn to scuba dive and a profession where he could scuba dive for a living sounded perfect. He graduated from Lanier High School in 1980 in Montgomery and worked at a bank for one year before joining the Montgomery Police Department in 1981 as a police cadet. He graduated the Montgomery Police Academy in June of 1983 and worked on the midnight shift.', 'Over the years, he would share his stories of police work with family and friends who suggested that he write a book about his career. He had kept daily notes and at the encouragement from his mother, wrote one story about a call he answered. She enjoyed the story, but also butchered it with what would be known later as “the red pen.” His only writing experience was writing police reports, so he had to learn how to write a story in novel form. After attending a writer’s conference, he learned that to be a good writer, you had to be constantly reading novels. He began reading fiction and nonfiction books written by and about police officers.', 'After 20 years working with the Montgomery Police Department and 5 years of writing, he self-published his first book, “It’s More than Shootouts and Car Chases,” Memoirs of a Montgomery Police Officer.', 'Steve has since published two more books. In 2019 he published “Secret of Winter Place,” a time travel novel based in Montgomery. In 2020, he published his third book and the first of a new police series entitled \"Seeking Revenge.” Steve uses his years of law enforcement experience to write this new action packed series about Corporal John Steele, a patrol officer answering calls with a new partner fresh out of the police academy.', 'Steve is married and has two daughters. He lives in Deatsville, Alabama and works for the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office as a Crime Scene Investigator. He did eventually learn to scuba dive.']}"
