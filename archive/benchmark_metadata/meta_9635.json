        "Help Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup kick some villain butt--but first they've got to figure out which monkey is the real Mojo Jojo. The very vile Mojo Jojo is at it again, and this time the maniacal monkey's cloned himself over and over. Now menacing minions of Mojo Jojo clones are wreaking havoc throughout Townsville. The Powerpuff Girls need your math, reading, and vocabulary smarts to take out that simpering simian, smash the clones, and save the day before it's too late for Townsville.",

Plus, special Powerpuff Girls printouts let kids take Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup with them wherever they go.",
        "Review",
        "This is a nice Powerpuff game with content focusing on 1st through 3rd grade skills. The girl heroes are fighting Mojo the monkey who's trying to take over Townsville (that poor town is always in jeopardy!). To make things worse, Mojo clones are sprinkled throughout town, making a big mess of things. The CD has lots of strengths. First of all, the activities are strong, and effectively integrate school skills. There's a clever, doable, mapping activity in which Buttercup catches Mojo using directional terms (north, south, east, west) and number of units in miles (1, 2, 3, 4). To get rid of scattered trash, kids combine letters to make words with clearly spoken letter sounds as clues. They answer math problems to trap Mojo clones, and drive through particular shapes to get to Mojo's castle. Rewards consist of chips that are inserted in a word changing machine, ultimately revealing Mojo's secrets (presented as word puzzles). Levels automatically adjust (or can be adjusted), detailed progress reports are kept, and there's an art center for the creation of pictures. The printing function can even be disengaged (very thoughtful). Our testers were reluctant to stop playing. --",
