        "The inebriating scent of iris will provide long-lasting freshness, thanks to this pleasant deodorant Cream. With its very delicate formula, it effectively eliminates the unpleasant effects of perspiration and inhibits microbial growth and thus the degradation of sweat, without altering your skin's natural flora. All this combined with the aqueous extracts of iris and marsh mallow, which ensure gentle protection for the delicate skin of the underarm area."
