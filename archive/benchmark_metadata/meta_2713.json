        "For the past 10 years, I have written a blog for real estate investors and published it on the Memphis Invest website.  During this time, I was writing hundreds of articles for the real estate in vesting forum site, Bigger Pockets.  Writing The Turnkey Revolution, became a natural progression of having spent so many hours working with and writing about my interactions with thousands of real estate investors.  Those blog articles and investing articles on Bigger Pockets were the springboard for this book!The stories you read and the investors mentioned are real with only their names changed.  Watching investors make both good and bad decisions and having a front-row seat to a company growing from one person into a $100M company managing over $600M in real estate assets gives me a unique perspective into how successful investors make decisions.Add to that the fact that I myself have both failed and succeeded as an investor and The Turnkey Revolution becomes a pretty good field guide to buying single-family homes passively and smartly!  I am proud of this book and the fact that is captures my families company, our dreams, our integrity and beliefs and the hard work of our team so perfectly.  I sincerely hope you enjoy the book and find the courage to take your own steps into The Turnkey Revolution.   Best, Chris",
