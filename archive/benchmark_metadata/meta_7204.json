        "Getting Started in Options",
        "an excellent first read on the subject. Beginning with the premise that it's not the complexity of the investment but that of its language that makes options difficult for new investors to understand, author Michael C. Thomsett has created a guided tour through the lexicon. The result is a nontechnical introduction to these specialized markets.",
        "The book carefully and completely defines the terminology, explains options investing step by step, and presents strategies so that it is easy to understand at each level of risk involved. Choosing the right stock, buying and selling options, and combining techniques are all covered in increasing complexity, but this is a book for beginners, and those with basic knowledge of the subject will want to seek out more advanced reading.",
        "The biggest drawback of this book is that, for some reason, the text is printed in green ink, making it somewhat more difficult to read and probably impossible for those who are green-colorblind. Publisher, take note!",
