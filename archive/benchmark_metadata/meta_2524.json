        "How long would you keep fighting for something that keeps tearing you apart?",
        "Emergency services worker Kylee Dunn has a life that looks perfect on the surface. A caring husband. A beautiful home. A large group of friends. And a job that feels more like a brotherhood than a workplace.",
        "But scratch a little deeper and the truth starts to spill out.",
        "Nightmares that never end. Responsibilities that seem reasonable but are anything but. And a heart and mind so abused by their experiences that Kylee can barely recognise the woman she’s become.",
        "And then hope appears in the form of a complete stranger, who starts to slowly put Kylee back together again."

        "\"This is quite different from what I expected from Nicola. I did enjoy the story. It is worth reading and gives an insight into the life of a first responder. They are like the rest of us; they live, love and bleed, in more ways than one.\"",

        "From the Author",
        "This fictional story is a brutally honest look at life as a paramedic, drawn from my own experiences working in Auckland City, New Zealand.   IN SHEETS OF RAIN is right from the heart, my loves. It's been 19 years since I donned the uniform and climbed up into an EMS truck. But it's still with me every single day.   A sometimes thankless job, but nevertheless an important one. This one is dedicated to all those who venture out and offer their aid to others in need. In the past, right now during this pandemic, and in the future.   You are legends.   Thank you!"
