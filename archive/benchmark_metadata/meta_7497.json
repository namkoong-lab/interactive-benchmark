        "When fifteen-year-old Esme Silver objects at her father's wedding, her protest is dismissed as the action of a stubborn, selfish teenager. Everyone else has accepted the loss of Esme's mother, Ariane - so why can't she?  But Esme is suspicious. She is sure that others are covering up the real reason for her mother's disappearance - that 'lost at sea' is code for something more terrible, something she has a right to know.  After Esme is accidentally swept into the enchanted world of Aeolia, the truth begins to unfold. With her newfound friends, Daniel and Lillian, Esme retraces her mother's steps in the glittering canal city of Esperance, untangling the threads of Ariane's double life. But the more Esme discovers about Ariane, the more she questions whether she really knew her at all.",
        "This inventive tale, the first in an MG-to-YA series, is an ideal read for 10-14 year olds.   Winner of best fantasy in the Purple Dragonfly Book Awards, which recognises excellence in children's literature."

        "This story has everything I love in a great fantasy:sumptuous world-building, fantastical creatures, an interesting magical system, engaging characters... I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next book in this series, Esme's Gift.",
        "Book Craic.",
        "Esme is a strong character, whose story is powerful... Although set in a magical world, she remains very much relatable and inspiring... this book is suitable for Middle Grade+ readers, who love themes of magic and discovery... well worth the read, especially for those who love Percy Jackson and the Chronicles of Narnia!",
        "The Book Reviewer.",
        "Esme's Wish is a gripping magical story. Esme is a fantastic main character. She's smart, gentle and caring. She's never given up on her mother and her loyalty knows no bounds. I was incredibly curious about each truth she unravels. She's a resilient and determined girl and she constantly conquers her fears, which is something I admired about her. Esme's Wish is filled with surprising twists and turns and I loved searching for clues together with the brave Esme. Esme's Wish is a terrific beginning of a series and I can't wait to read more about Esme and her friends. Elizabeth Foster completely enchanted me with her wonderful story and I look forward to the next one.",
        "With Love for Books.",
        "Esme's Wish is a fantasy woven with dragons, magical powers, enchanted objects, and a scenery that is breathtaking to read. Add a little Greek Mythology into the mix and a mother-daughter relationship for the most realistic vibe. It's basically a perfect recipe for a MG-to-YA to devour...The visual images were created beautifully and worked as a cherry on top to the reverie by the city of Esperance. The book had three things that made it a perfect fit for the targeted readers: friendship, willpower, and love.",
        "Fanna.",
        "Foster manages to pack a load of details into the pages, while also being economical with words. There are no long pages that make you lose interest or that deviate too much from the story line and plot. The characters are all well-formed and Esme is strong and determined, but also shows her vulnerability and emotions. Friendships are a strong theme throughout the book and Foster ensures they are realistic. Not everyone gets along, and that's okay. It was also refreshing to read about three teenagers, without a love triangle in sight.",

        "About the Author",
        "Elizabeth Foster lives in Sydney, where she loves swimming in the ocean, walking, and playing the piano (badly). As a child, she was called Dizzy Lizzy-which she regarded as an insult all her life, until she started writing. Now, daydreaming is a central part of what she does. Reading to her own kids reminded her of how much she missed getting lost in other worlds, and once she started writing stories, she couldn't stop. Esme's Wish is her first novel."
