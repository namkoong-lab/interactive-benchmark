        "“If you’ve ever felt despair about the state of the world or wondered, ‘What can I do?’ I recommend reading Renewable. Eileen Flanagan’s insightful memoir shows a deep understanding of complex global problems, while showing us how one person can change their life while working to change the world we all share.” ―Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director Greenpeace International “Simple, beautiful and nourishing, this book is a necessary reminder that the renewable energy we need most is people power!” ―Bill McKibben, founder 350.org “In a book laced with humorous anecdotes, Eileen Flanagan writes of her quest for simplicity while beset by the contradictions of modern life.
