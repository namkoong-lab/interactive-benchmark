        "Finally something is happening in our living room since the big bang!",
        "Space travel has become obsolete since you can now simply bring 60,000 stars to your room by pushing a single button.Imagine watching the stars while sitting comfortably on the couch or lying in bed. With the Homestar Original Planetarium, this dream becomes reality. The lenses project an amazingly accurate sky with 60,000 stars onto the ceiling or wall. Rotational movement is possible. Two interchangeable projection discs with the stars of the northern hemisphere allow you to observe the night sky as it is visible to us. With the \"shooting star\" function you can even dream beyond! Projection angle and focus are adjustable and a convenient timer is used to automatically turn it off.The Homestar series was designed by the Japanese inventor Takayuki Ohira, a recognized expert for professional planetariums. His work includes the Cosmos Model no. 3 or the Megastar II Cosmos, the world's most advanced planetarium in the Guinness Book of Records. His expertise will be part of your Sega Toys Homestar Original too.(We offer fast",
