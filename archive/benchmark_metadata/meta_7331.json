        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 5 Up—Informative and inspiring, this collection of 72 stories from American history demonstrate the impact that teenagers have been able to make when they believe in a cause. Barrett exposes readers to the defiance and activism of adolescents who are often overlooked in history books, from 16-year-old Sybil Ludington's midnight ride warning the countryside of a British attack in 1777 to the 2014 counterdemonstration organized by Wilson High School students (in Washington, DC) in response to a hate group's presence outside their school. The author makes it clear that young people have played an integral role in many American social movements. For the most part, he briefly and effectively describes each example from its roots to its conclusion. However, there are many case studies, such as \"The March for Principal Baker,\" where the resolution is either ambiguous or not included, leaving readers to wonder about the outcome. Other entries don't mention any teenage rebels and instead function as opportunities for the author to grandstand about issues that he considers troublesome, such as \"'Abstinence-Only' Education\" and \"No Child Left Behind.\" Perhaps the biggest drawback is the lack of photographs. Instead, illustrations in shades of black and gray accompany the text and seem to trivialize the courageous acts. VERDICT Though a bit flawed, this title will attract budding activists and young history buffs.—Audrey Sumser, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Mayfield, OH",
        "Review",
        "Cuts through the strange separateness, superficiality, and social disconnectedness commonly ascribed to teenagers to the underlying core truth that teens are people who are connected to their world. Every single astonishing story that Dawson relates, from 16 year-old Sybil Ludington's 1777 ride to alert the militia of a British attack, to the 21st century high school students fighting for gay and transgender rights and the rights of immigrants, illustrate the deep concern of young people about their society, and their willingness to act on that. --Mark Rudd, The Weather Underground",
        "\"It's nothing new that high school students are left out of the political process. They've even been left out of most histories of student movements, which focus on colleges--although they led many brave battles in the face of fire hoses in Birmingham and rifles in Johannesberg. In this lucid book, Dawson Barrett corrects that omission. Hopefully these stories will inspire a new generation to fight for their future and not settle for the present. Climate change, unemployment, inequality, all these injustices are stealing from the future.\" -- Tom Hayden, activist and author",
        "\"As someone who became active in high school--protesting the Vietnam War, fighting for Black Power, demanding more rights for students--I was thrilled with the publication of this work. It reminds the reader of the proud tradition of progressive student activism and that, far from being limited to college students, it has been a phenomenon crossing many age, gender, racial and ethnic boundaries.\" --Bill Fletcher, Jr., writer/activist; author of \"They're Bankrupting Us\" - And Twenty Other Myths about Unions",
        "\"Unlabeled and under-the-radar, teenagers create their political identities in Dawson Barrett's stories of young people successfully fighting the power. Righteous and inspiring!\" --Jennifer Baumgardner, author of Manifesta, Grassroots, and Look Both Ways",
        "\"The timing of Dawson Barrett's Teenage Rebels couldn't be better. Now that standardized testing has been abolished, and Congress has diverted $500 billion per year to public education from the defense and homeland security budgets, and from taxes on the prison-industrial complex, we will finally have free, engaging, quality education for all American kids.\" --Senator Andy Bichlbaum (D-New Virginia)",
