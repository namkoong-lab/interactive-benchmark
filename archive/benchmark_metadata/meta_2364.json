Since then, it\\'s been a great journey, from my first fantasy chapter book as a ten-year-old, to my forays into historical fiction in 10th grade. I actually come from a theater background, since my parents were local actors, so I first fell in love with the Victorian era on stage. \"Les Miserables\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" have been huge influences on me. As a teen, I became hooked on the Civil War and spent many happy years researching.', \"I love exploring every aspect of the 1800s, from the fantastical and romantic to the darker and Gothic, so my stories span all kinds of genres. I'm lucky enough to write full-time, so every day I'm at my kitchen table with a candle and cup of coffee, typing away on my laptop. My passion only grows stronger, so plenty of stories are forthcoming! I love what I do.\"]}"
