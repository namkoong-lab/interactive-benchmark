        "On the heels of her mother's death, Hope Logan reluctantly returned to her grandparents' home place in search of a journal that revealed explosive crimes and atrocities of the past that haunted her grandma for nearly sixty-five years. Bitterness, unforgiveness, and anger consumed her as she set out to solve the mystery that surrounded her grandma's life. The dark evil secret that was contained in the journal only deepened her resentment of God. Because of her quest, she came in contact with many strong believers, especially a handsome young pastor and three senior citizens.In that small town in the foothills of the mountains of North Carolina, Hope's bitterness, unforgiveness, and anger slowly began to fade in the light of the strong faith of the young pastor and three senior citizens. She discovered the true meaning of faith and hope in Christ in the midst of adversity."

She is retired from Union County Public Schools where she was the Administrative Assistant to the Assistant Superintendent. She has two daughters and four grandchildren who also reside in the Old North State. All of Carolyn's books are southern Christian stories that include mysteries, human relationships, and always a touch of romance. Her stories reflect the lives of ordinary people and their life situations. Since Carolyn grew up in the south, she writes about places that are familiar to her. She has spent her entire life in North Carolina except when her husband was in the military. She grew up in a preacher's home in Charlotte, North Carolina, and spent her teenage years in Monroe, North Carolina. Carolyn met her husband in 1959 at the church where her father was pastor. Not only did they go to church together, but they also rode the school bus together. They were married in 1965 and have spent fifty-eight years together. Her hobbies include music, writing, genealogy, collecting antiques, and scrapbooking old family pictures. She always has historical facts in her books, because she is well-versed in American history and loves to research it. Carolyn's writing journey began after an extended illness that led to her retirement from the school district.\"]}"
