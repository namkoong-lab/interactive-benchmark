        "When her mother becomes critically ill on Oahu, thirteen-year-old Abigail Kendall must travel with sister, Sarah, and friends Luke and Kini to California to escape the disease. But upon arrival at Luke's Aunt Dagmar's, they can tell they're not welcome. Because gold has just been discovered near Sutter's Mill, the children strike out for the fields, hoping some \"quick money\" will provide a doctor for Ma and a permanent home for the Kendalls. But all isn't easy in the goldfields. The work is hard, Luke gets \"gold fever,\" and they hear rumors of children being kidnapped. Then Kini and Sarah disappear! As Abby searches desperately for the missing children, she discovers that God knows the desires of our hearts--and never deserts us."
