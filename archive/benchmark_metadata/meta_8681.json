        "To be fair, Manhattan plastic surgeon Harrison Hanafan was not technically swept off his feet by Mimi when they first met on Christmas Eve. He managed to slip on the ice all on his own, and the resulting sprained ankle provided an ironclad excuse to finally break up with his erstwhile, overbearing girlfriend, Gertrude. But when he meets Mimi again a few weeks later, their love affair seems destined in a way neither can help or explain. While Mozart and Schubert provide the background score, their shared bohemian quirkiness, bawdy bravado, and mutually appreciative sense of feminist outrage stand them in good stead until Gertrude unexpectedly insinuates herself back into Harrison’s life. Soon after Mimi leaves him, Harrison’s beloved sister, Bee, dies, and without the women who matter most, Harrison finds his life spiraling out of control. With its saucy take on the perpetually perplexing battle of the sexes, Ellmann’s zany, zestful contemporary romantic comedy pulses with sultry steaminess and titillating humor. --Carol Haggas",
