        "Breaking the Barriers by B.B. Swann is the story of Cindy Wilson and Mike Ryan who are high school seniors and in a relationship. Their relationship is a secret mainly because of Cindy's mother who does not want her to be in one until she completes college. No one in the Elkwood High Class of 1986 knew they were dating, only their best friends Hayden and Molly. Mike, on the other hand, was tired of this secrecy. He wanted acceptance, understanding, belonging, and passion. Cindy was afraid she might end up hurting her family if her interracial relationship with Mike was revealed, especially to her ailing father. Finally, she agreed to be open about it in school. Will Cindy's parents find out? Will Mike's family approve of Cindy? Will Mike and Cindy have a future together?This story is about love, social acceptance, jealousy, and more and has some interesting twists and turns that will leave readers curious to know more. This high school love story and the interracial theme will connect well with many readers in the same age group who are in high school. The characters are real and relatable and that makes the book an engaging read. All the characters in the story are well portrayed and they complement the main characters and the story well. The hardships Mike and Cindy endure while trying to break the barriers to move forward in their relationship are palpable to readers and they will experience sadness, heartbreak, humor, and happiness while reading this love story, just like the two main characters.",
        "5 Stars: The Prairies Book Review",
        "A moving portrayal of an interracial romance...",
        "In this impressively moving YA romance, Swann narrates the love story of an interracial couple who struggle against the barriers erected by family and friends in 80s conservative society. Sensitive and obedient Cindy Wilson is in love with sensible Mike Ryan but is afraid to come out in open because of her parents' reserved outlook toward interracial relationships. Mike, who is least bothered by peer and family pressure, would do anything to get his relationship accepted even if it means risking his own life. With a keen eye for detail and a thorough understanding of a horde of conflicting teenager emotions, Swann weaves an intricate romance as she explores the emotions and conflicts of her teenager protagonists, as well as the reservations and racial issues of 80s conservative society. Filled with passion and conflict, Swann's tale will appeal equally to teenagers and parents."
