        "The Lord impressed us to write a second counseling book about spiritual warfare in which we share some invaluable truths from God's Word, and expound on biblical counseling procedures and share many prayers for specific subjects. The book also shares lessons to inspire Christians to mature in the Lord and walk in His will for their precious lives after they have received freedom from the enemy through our Lord Jesus. It addresses negative learned behavioral issues and offers solutions. We are confident that our Lord's biblical teachings in both books will be a blessing to ministers, missionaries, counselors, counselees and anyone wanting to learn this subject matter. The new partner to \"\"Liberating the Bruised\"\" is \"\"More Tools for Liberating the Bruised\"\"."
