Based on the screenplay by Kris Ketonen and Lee Chambers. Dan Craig, a former VP of Production at Universal Pictures called the award-winning screenplay version \"a really good script with the BIG idea!\" #1 Amazon Best Seller Rank: Supernatural & Fantasy (October 2017)#1 Amazon Best Seller Rank: Supernatural & Fantasy (November 2016)#1 Amazon Best Seller Rank: YA Mystery (July & September 2012)#1 Amazon Best Seller Rank: YA Science Fiction & Fantasy (July 2012)#1 Amazon Best Seller Rank: Angels (July 2012)",
        "From the Author",
        "Q:  \"How did The Sum of Random Chance come together?",
        "Lee:",
        "\"It was written with Kris Ketonen as a screenplay first. Since successfully directing The Pineville Heist (which sold over 42,000 copies in book formats), I have moved towards turning The Sum of Random Chance into a movie as well. It's a more personal tale and very uplifting.\"",
        "Q:  \"What is the essence of the story?\"",
        "Lee:",
        "\"It is a character piece that explores the ethical and moral issues of putting wealth and power ahead of kindness and decency. Featuring leading characters based in their young twenties, the book showcases a unique generation that is over-shadowed by growing media influences that are determined to sell us - everything. It touches on the sensational aspects of the media, and how they favor speed rather than accuracy. It's a satirical look at a media-heavy world where the choices we make in our early adult years have a strong impact on who we become in maturity.\"",
        "Q:  \"So who are the characters?\"",
        "Lee:",
        "\"Our hero, Cole, is convinced success is marked by fame, power and money. On course to follow in the footsteps of a sleazy senior reporter, Cole's misguided goals and dreams are challenged after a chance meeting with Sara, an extraordinary person. The moment is either highly magical or extremely coincidental. The story is huge, as is Cole's ethical dilemma. Does he sell out the naïve and trusting Sara to further his own desires for stardom, or will he stand fast for what is right? Through Sara Cole will have a chance to evolve and transform and eventually see errors of his ways, but will he see it before it is too late? This is the question.\"-",
        "Q:  \"What genre does 'The Sum of Random Chance' fit into?\"",
        "Lee:",
        "\"It's a drama with mystery, some fantasy and a hint of romance.\"",
        "Q:  \"Any comparisons to other books?\"",
        "Lee:",
        "\"As I am also a film director I'll point to my cinematic influences rather than literary. The story features the hyped media attentions of",
