        "The 4Cs of Diamonds",
        "Diamonds are commonly assessed in terms of the “4 Cs”: Cut, Clarity, Color, and Carat.",
        "Cut.",
        "A good cut has a high refractive index, giving the diamond its brilliance (how shiny), dispersion (how fiery), and scintillation (how glittery).The princess cut is the second most popular cut shape for diamonds. Most top grade princess cuts diamonds have 78 facets, and princess cut CZ usually come in 45 facets. We have achieved an amazing 101 facets for our princess cut stones. With more facets, our diamond simulants are able to reflect more light, making them full of fire, and brilliance and glitter.",
        "Clarity.",
        "Our diamond simulants are created in a laboratory under ideal conditions. Hence there are no blemishes or impurities such as trace minerals or black spot that could be found in real diamonds.",
        "Color.",
        "Our diamond simulants are created absolute colorless D, similar to top-grade real diamonds. This is the most desirable color as its complete transparency allows the most fire and sparkle. We have achieved an exceptional 101 Princess cut with our latest computer-aided laser cutting technology, which makes our stones 30 percent brighter than other diamonds. Because our stones deliver high brilliance, fire and sparkle, they are superior in reflecting the maximum amount of light to the eye. They offer edge-to-edge brilliance with explosions of white and colored light, even in low light conditions i.e. from across the room at a party or in a candle-lit restaurant."
