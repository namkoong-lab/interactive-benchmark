        "From Library Journal",
        "Here's everything you'd ever want to know about peppers from someone who truly loves them. Naj, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal , enthusiastically chronicles his quest for information about chiles and the people who crave, cultivate, and classify them. Peppered throughout with many amusing anecdotes about this pungent fruit and its devotees, this well-researched book is as entertaining as it is informative. Unlike Mark Miller's The Great Chile Book (Ten Speed Pr., 1991), which merely describes and illustrates the more common varieties, Naj's title details the beneficial medicinal properties of peppers, the techniques designed to measure their hotness, the process of breeding exotic varieties, the great chile sauce war, and other little-known but intriguing facts. Essential for all libraries whose patrons enjoy hot, spicy food.",

        "Naj, a Wall Street Journal writer born and raised in Bengal, travels in Central and South America and the US Southwest in pursuit of pepper specialists and special peppers--all of the hot, capsaicin-endowed varieties known to most of us as chiles. Naj tramps the Andean foothills of Bolivia--a likely candidate for the birthplace of hot peppers--with a botanist seeking the mother of all chiles. He is drawn to the Yucatan by haba¤ero, a Mayan staple and the hottest of all peppers. He visits the McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, Louisiana, and digs up ugly controversies surrounding its jealously protected trademark tabasco sauce. He attends a National Pepper Conference in North Carolina, and visits pepper farmers, tasters, breeders (of ``designer chiles''), pathologists, pharmacologists, and enthusiasts in Texas, New Mexico, and elsewhere. Naj's account of all of this goes down easily; and a chapter on peppers' appeal, including speculation on the ``pepper high'' and its possible addictive qualities, has a special interest for the growing cult of North American chile users. His botanical information, though, isn't much help in sorting out the different varieties and names; at times, he seems to toss off peculiar statements of fact without much questioning or trying to reconcile or even cite his sources. Still, an agreeable assemblage of lore and field reportage. --",
