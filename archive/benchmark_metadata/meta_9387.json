        "Praise for the Previous Edition (0 415 92612 2): ...lively and provocative...this book will teach you something startling on nearly every page... --The New York Times Book Review Like the Emerald City, Las Vegas glitters brightly in the vast Nevada desert, a haven for refugees from ordinary America. A hip, iconic, playground that exports nothing, it nonetheless earns billions from consumer services alone -- gambling, hotels, gaming, and entertainment. It is, historian Hal Rothman argues, the quintessential city of the future. As other cities try to mirror its success and huge, respectable corporations like Coca-Cola invest in a piece of the pie, the very traits that have ostracized Las Vegas in the past -- hedonism, money worship, and permissiveness -- have today made it America's fastest growing urban center. From the gambling-driven, mob-run Sin City of the 1940s to the corporatization of the Strip as a respectable family entertainment center after the 1970s, Las Vegas has shown incredible economic resilience and adaptability. The first full account of America's new dream capital, Neon Metropolis brilliantly shows how Las Vegas gambled on the post-industrial service economy well before the rest of the country knew it was coming, and won."

        "In this thoughtful study, Rothman (history, Univ. of Nevada, Las Vegas) provides a detailed history of a uniquely American city. The subject of urban planning and design is enriched by Rothman's focus on the social history of the city, including its architecture, economics, government, labor issues, transportation, environmental policy, and immigration situation. Rothman argues that Las Vegas survives by responding to whatever source of prosperity is available, whether it is the U.S. military or the gaming industry. In Las Vegas's malleability, he sees the future of all U.S. cities, along with attendant issues of social isolation and environmental abuse. His empathetic exploration of working-class Latino lives is especially rewarding. Recommended for academic and public library collections emphasizing urban studies, American history, and the Latino experience. Paula R. Dempsey, DePaul Univ.

        "Rothman, a professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a frequent commentator on the local culture, presents a thorough study of Las Vegas, a city with about as quirky a history as any in the U.S. Though Las Vegas was once just a whistle- stop on the L.A. railroad, loose regulations on adult pleasures and a lock on water access brought in Mob \"shoebox money\" to finance this paradise of vice in the desert. It was never a secret that Vegas was a syndicate-run town, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, as city and state authorities looked the other way, the money poured in, but it always remained tainted. Then Howard Hughes bought half the town, and legislation opened up to allow free corporate access. The mobsters were practically run out of town, opening the way for the theme-park-like atmosphere that pervades today. Rothman gets inside the psyche of the Vegas mystique, where luxury is affordable to all, everyone is a star, and entertainment is king like nowhere else.",

        "\"[Rothman] treasures the moment when Jerry Tarkanian (a towel-chewing stoic) took his Runnin' Rebels to the N.C.A.A. basketball finals, and defeated Duke, despite the 'snotty' sign borne by some Duke supporters: 'Welcome, fellow student-athletes.' This informative and useful book comes loaded...there is a wealth of practical detail...This book will teach you something startling on nearly every page.\" -- New York Times Book Review\"A brilliant interpretation of the supernova of American Cities.\" -- Mike Davis, author of",

Unlike others who have tried to capture the city, Rothman doesn't traffic in conspiracy theories or florid prose to make Las Vegas seem larger or darker than life. Instead, he has produced a sprightly written book that took him out of the ivory tower and onto the streets to produce a compelling and accurate picture of the neon metropolis.\" -- Jon Ralston\"Most of the information we receive about modern places is as ignorant as it is superficial, and yet from the very capital of superficiality and glitz, Las Vegas, Hal Rothman has paradoxically delivered a book that is engaged, funny, smart and historically informed. Las Vegas, Rothman tells us, represents socially sanctioned deviance. The deviance in",

A stunning contribution to labor studies and western history, this book provides a bold and compelling portrait of America's City of Lights, a place where dreams are made and dreams are shattered all under a corporate sky.

His deft, ever insightful portrait of Las Vegas and its tumultuous and bizarre rise is a marriage of scholarship and journalism made not in some Strip wedding chapel but in the solid tradition of urban history.\" -- Sally Denton, author of",
