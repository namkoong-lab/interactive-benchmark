In college she made an animated short called \"Angry Little Asian Girl\" but kept it hidden in a drawer. Years later, she added 4 more episodes which screened for the first time in 1998. The LA Times and LA Weekly gave the episodes glowing reviews and soon people began asking to read comics that did not yet exist. Because of this suggestion, Lela taught herself how to draw comics and a website was launched as a self-publishing platform. She sold t-shirts out of the trunk of her car and met enough women to know that many women harbored angry sentiments. In 2000, Lee expanded \"Angry Little Asian Girl\" to the umbrella name \"Angry Little Girls.\" The first \"Angry Little Girls\" book was published in April 2005 and two months later, it had gone into its fourth printing. Six more books were published and translated into Korean, French, and German and the products were sold into malls all over the US and abroad.']}"
