        "The benefits of safety razor shave: <b>A closer shave:</b> That sharp blade is flush against your skin. So, be careful, but if you master the craft, you’ll never look back.",
        "<b>Less drag, less irritation:</b> While other razors advertise 3-5 razors in a single cartridge, the safety razor stands strong at a single strong blade. This means there is less dragging across the face, less chance that your top layer of skin will come off with the hairs, and less bulk building up between blades, while being dragged across your opened pores. All that to say, a safety razor promises a safer, healthier shave when done correctly.",
        "<b>Better for coarse hair:</b> If you have thick hair that just doesn’t budge under the lightness of a standard cartridge shave (or if the hairs are too thick and lead to dragging, clogging, and irritation), then a safety razor is the obvious fix. Plus, since you’ll replace the blade after each use, it’ll never give you a dull shave.",
        "<b>Cheap replacement blades:</b> They’re maybe 10-25 cents each, when you buy in bulk. You’ll never hesitate to toss them after a single use, which means you only use the sharpest, cleanest blades every time.",
        "<b>You’re in charge: </b>The shave requires more attention and precision, but it puts you in more control over the process. You have to think about each stroke, and the amount of pressure (ideally none) that you’re applying, plus the angle. Yes, it’s a process, but your skin shouldn’t be something you manage and manicure on autopilot. Take your time, make it a ceremony, and you’ll look forward to the safety-razor regimen every couple days."

        "Why is Shaving with a Safety Razor Better?",
        "Shaving with a safety razor reduces skin irritation, shave bumps, and ingrown hairs that are common with cartridge or electric razors. The main reason is that with a safety razor you only have one blade against your skin at any time.",
        "There are so many other benefits of Traditional Wet Shaving with a safety razor",
        "It is Traditional",
        "It is a Better Shave",
        "It is less Expensive",
        "It is Environmentally Friendly",
        "It is Enjoyable",
        "HOW TO USE ZEVA SAFETY RAZOR",
        "Hot Towel & Shave Soap",
        "Shave after your shower, or apply a hot towel with Shave Tonic to your beard for approximately 30 seconds. Steam softens facial hair making it easier to shave. The effort required to cut hair is reduced by 2/3 when hair is wet. Less effort means less friction and more comfort. The use of a shave brush will evenly disperse the Shave Soap and lift facial hair. Allow shaving cream to sit on your skin for at least 30 seconds.",
        "Use Zeva Safety Razor in the Direction of Your Hair Growth",
        "Start shaving the sides of the face first, going in the direction of your hair growth. Hold safety razor firmly and use short strokes. Don’t add pressure or push the blade into your skin. For the closest shave, an ideal angle to hold the blade to your skin is 30 degrees.",
        "Cold Water / Cold Towel Clean Up",
        "Follow your shave with a splash of cold water. For the ultimate experience, apply Shave Tonic with a cold washcloth to close the pores."
