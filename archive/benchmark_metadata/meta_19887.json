        "The Graco® SlimFit® 3-in-1 Car Seat grows with your child, from rear-facing harness (5-40 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb) to highback booster (40-100 lb). It saves space in your back seat, while giving your child plenty of room to grow. The unique, rotating cup holders simply rotate away, making the seat 10% slimmer to save precious back seat space. The Simply Safe Adjust™ Harness System means you can easily adjust the harness and headrest together, to accommodate your growing child with ease. With 4 recline positions, you can keep your child comfortable, while the InRight™ LATCH system makes installation easy with a one-second attachment. The seat is Graco® ProtectPlus Engineered™ to help protect your little one in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes. Rear-Facing Harness: 5-40 lb, head must be at least 1\" below handle; Forward-Facing Harness: 22-65 lb, up to 49\"; Highback Booster: 40-100 lb, 43-57\", at least 4 years old. STOP using this child restraint and throw it away 10 years after the date of manufacture. Recommended Use] Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. Then children should ride forward-facing, using the built-in harness system for as long as possible until they reach the maximum forward-facing weight or height for their car seat. At that point, children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. A booster is no longer needed once the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they reach 4 feet 9 inches tall and are between ages 8-12. Be sure to check your local and state laws, as well as AAP and NHTSA recommendations, for car seat usage.* *Graco Supports the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Car Seat Guidelines. Visit our safety page for information on car seat usage recommendations."
