        "Martha Davis, often called a female Fats Waller, was one of the brightest pianist-singers of the 1930s and 40s, and was indeed trained by Waller himself. She didn't gain true stardom, however, until the early 1950s, when she married and partnered bassist Calvin Ponder, forming the new group Martha Davis and Spouse. They became a sensation and their sold-out club appearances led to national TV exposure with Perry Como, Garry Moore and Steve Allen. Martha's infectious humour, boisterous singing style and powerful piano, reminiscent of Nellie Lutcher, Julia Lee and Hadda Brooks led to two critically acclaimed albums for ABC-Paramount, 1957s 'Martha Davis & Spouse' and 1958s 'A Tribute To Fats Waller' which are now available on CD for the very first time. Rounding out the release are four rare transcription soundtracks, making a chock-filled collection of 28 songs, guaranteed to put a smile on your face and a tap in your foot."
