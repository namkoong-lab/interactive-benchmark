        "Drew Leclair knows what it takes to be a great detective. She’s pored over the cases solved by her hero, criminal profiler Lita Miyamoto. She tracked down the graffiti artist at school, and even solved the mystery of her neighbor’s missing rabbit. But when her mother runs off to Hawaii with the school guidance counselor, Drew is shocked. How did she miss all of the clues?",

        "Armed with her notebooks full of observations about her classmates, Drew knows what she has to do: profile all of the bullies in her grade to find the culprit.

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 5 Up-Drew Leclair is a seventh grade misfit whose mom has just run off with her school counselor. Drew is mortified and she is doing her best to lay low about it, until it is plastered all over an anonymous Instagram account for her school. This particular account goes for the students' most sensitive secrets. Drew, along with her two best friends, sets out to expose the anonymous poster. While she is making crime boards and profiling her classmates, Drew is also dealing with her parents' split and questions about her own sexuality. Drew is not sure why she doesn't seem to be developing feelings for anyone her age, least of all her best friend who keeps trying to kiss her. Could something be wrong with her? Bury deftly handles this topic, as well as cyber safety and privacy, with a sprinkling of other resonant issues like fat-shaming, consent, and acceptance of differences of all kinds, with a light touch that does not veer into didacticism. VERDICT The perfect story for a kid who wants a little more than just a mystery about a school cyberbully. Readers who are ready to progress from Nancy Drew (who the main character was named after) but are not quite ready for One of Us Is Lying by Karen M. McManus will enjoy this book.-Kim Gardnerα(c) Copyright 2011. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc. No redistribution permitted.",
