        "Mean to Meaningful illuminates the powerful impact of a hand up. This engaging book chronicles the journey of an angry child raised by a hard working mother and a loving grandmother. The early years were challenging and absent the influence of sports and the encouragement of a handful of coaches this story probably ends in a graveyard. Ed Wile loved football, and his high school coach, Jack Peterson, convinced Ed to go with him to college. Jack was a rising star headed to Wofford College as the offensive coordinator. No one in Ed's family had gone to college, and this was clearly a once in a lifetime opportunity. Ed thrived on the football field but failed everywhere else—until a pretty brown eyed girl found him and began to gently reset his faulty compass. They married and life was good until a toxic brew of alcohol and violence nearly ruined their marriage and left him unemployed with two young children. After several months of searching, Ed finally decided to take a job as stockbroker trainee at Kidder, Peabody and Company. It was a high risk high reward job where most failed. He really needed to succeed, but had no idea how. Ed would quickly discover that there are some very tall mountains, in business and in life, that exist between failure and real success. Experience the powerful influence of a hand up in this inspirational memoir."
