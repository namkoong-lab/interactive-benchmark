        "Primary care medicine, as we know and remember it, is in crisis. While policymakers, government administrators, and the health insurance industry pay lip service to the personal relationship between physician and patient, dissatisfaction and disaffection run rampant among primary care doctors, and medical students steer clear in order to pursue more lucrative specialties. Patients feel helpless, well aware that they are losing a valued close connection as health care steadily becomes more transactional than relational. The thin-margin efficiency, rapid pace, and high volume demanded by the new health care economics do not work for primary care, an inherently slower, more personal, and uniquely tailored service.",
        "In Out of Practice, Dr. Frederick Barken juxtaposes his personal experience with the latest research on the transformations in the medical field. He offers a cool critique of the \"market model of medicine\" while vividly illustrating how the seemingly inexorable trend toward specialization in the last few decades has shifted emphasis away from what was once the foundation of medical practice. Dr. Barken addresses the complexities of modern practice—overuse of diagnostic studies, fragmentation of care, increasing reliance on an array of prescription drugs, and the practice of defensive medicine. He shows how changes in medicine, the family, and society have left physicians to deal with a wide range of geriatric issues, from limited mobility to dementia, that are not addressed by health care policy and are not entirely amenable to a physician’s prescription. Indeed, Dr. Barken contends, the very survival of primary care is in jeopardy at a time when its practitioners are needed more than ever.",
        "Illustrated with case studies gleaned from more than twenty years in private practice and data from a wide range of sources, Out of Practice is more than a jeremiad about a broken system. Throughout, Dr. Barken offers cogent suggestions for policymakers and practitioners alike, making clear that as valuable as the latest drug or medical device may be, a successful health care system depends just as much on the doctor-patient relationship embodied by primary care medicine."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "This compelling plea for primary care medicine reveals a disturbing situation: \"Primary care medicine is collapsing, a victim of economists' tenets of maximized efficiency, profit, and productivity.\" The system will be further strained by the large numbers of aging baby boomers. Barken uses his own experience as a physician who retired early at age 51 due to dissatisfaction with the current situation to illustrate the state of his profession. He finds it overwhelmed, underfinanced, and ill-equipped to deal with older patients suffering from complex medical issues. Barken warns that doctors, patients, and politicians will have to accept that the primary physician's role must change, that a bigger health care industry isn't necessarily a better one, that malpractice liability, along with its high costs and demoralization of doctors, must be reined in. Primary-care doctors must resist the pressure to prescribe too many drugs and must manage a plethora of specialists who want to administer overly aggressive treatments that have little impact in prolonging life or making patients more comfortable. Physicians treating aging patients must also see them not as solitary units but as part of a well-prepared, involved family. In the end, he says, American health will be saved by its most important virtue: a strong physician-patient relationship. (Apr.) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.",

        "Review",
        "\"Barken does an outstanding job of chronicling the challenges widespread in practicing primary care medicine in the early 21st century. . . . He offers an astute analysis of how the current cultures of medicine, financial reimbursement, and medical malpractice . . . have effectively diminished the capacity of primary care physicians to do what they do best. . . . Barken is at once on target and engaging. His writing is logical and concise, and he intersperses detailed critiques of the system as a whole with interesting (and entertaining) case studies from his practice. For each problem he perceives, he suggests plausible and thoughtful solutions. . . . Reading",

He practiced solo Internal Medicine in rural upstate New York for nearly 25 years, until unfavorable trends in US health care policy made that practice no longer a possibility. Upon leaving practice he set out to write about his professional experiences and to record his reflections on the practice of primary care medicine. Using personal anecdotes accumulated over a quarter-century of care, he reminds us of the central role of the physician-patient relationship as the cornerstone of American health. The result is his new book, Out Of Practice: Fighting For Primary Care Medicine In America, to be released by Cornell University Press in April, 2011.', 'Dr. Barken received his undergraduate degree and a Master’s degree in Physiology from Cornell University. He attended the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and then completed his internship and residency training in Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia. He is board certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and licensed to practice medicine in the state of New York. He is now focusing on the current problems confronting primary care physicians and their patients, problems that leave the special relational quality of good primary care in a precarious position and in grave jeopardy.', 'Now serving as the Medical Director for Cayuga Medical Associates in an administrative role, Dr. Barken is keenly aware of the emerging shortage of primary care doctors and the difficulty recruiting new, young, and enthusiastic physicians to that field. At the same time, as Vice President of the Board at Longview, an Ithaca-based assisted care living facility for the elderly, he appreciates all too well the demographic of an aging US and the extraordinary strain it places on American health care providers. Dr. Barken’s book illustrates and explains the current crisis confronting primary care physicians and their patients. He seeks to promote the preservation of the special relationship between the two.', 'Dr. Barken and his wife live in Ithaca, where they raised their four children. He lectures on health care issues at Ithaca College.']}"
