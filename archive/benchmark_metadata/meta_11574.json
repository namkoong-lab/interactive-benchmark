        "12X50 Swarovision EL Binocular with HD Optics",
        "Amazon.com",
        "EL binoculars from Swarovski Optic deliver top of the line design with weather proof magnesium housing, diamond-bright optical performances with SwaroBright, SwaroTop, and SwaroDur coatings, and superior functionality with a unique wrap-around grip for comfortable one-handed operation. Thanks to SwaroVision technology, the binoculars provide edge to edge image clarity with field flattener lenses, maximum contrast and light fidelity with HD optics, and maximum eye relief to provide the same viewing comfort for eyeglass wearers.",
        "The EL SwaroVision 12X50 Binoculars feature large 50-millimeter objective lens diameters, for increased light gathering capabilities. Combined with the stellar SwaroVision optics, this guarantees high resolution, razor-sharp detail definition and color fidelity even in poor lighting conditions and over longer distances. With 12x magnification, you will enjoy noticeably brighter images than with binoculars featuring a 42-millimeter objective lens diameter and the same magnification level.",
        "SwaroVision Technology:",
        "Field Flattener Lenses: Thanks to the production of a virtually flat image, these lenses offer contrast right up to the image edge, so that even the finest structures and smallest details are reproduced with razor-sharp clarity. This high level of image quality over the entire field of view means less refocusing and allows the observer to employ peripheral vision to see small movements and identify colors and patterns at the edges of the image with greater ease.",

        "High-Definition (HD): The fluoride-containing HD lenses minimize color-fringing (chromatic aberration) for contrast-rich images with razor-sharp outlines. As a result, significant improvements in resolution and contrast are achieved by comparison with conventional grades of glass.",

        "Greater Eye Relief for 100 percent Field of View for Eyeglass-Wearers: Due to larger eye relief of the exit pupil, even eyeglass wearers can survey the entire wide-angle field of view and enjoy the EL's unique edge sharpness. The removable twist-in eyecups are individually adjustable in three stages. In addition to the maximum position (completely twisted out) and the setting for eyeglass-wearers (completely twisted in), the eyecups also have a snap-in intermediate stage.",
