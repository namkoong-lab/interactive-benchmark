Christians are only beginning to understand Islam and the people who practice it.

        "Review",
        "[T]he book can serve as an inviting overview of Islam and its practice in the modern world for students who are quickly overwhelmed by otherwise good but dense considerations of the tradition.",
        "Catholic Books Review",
        "Islam Considered is very helpful in that it compares tenets of the Muslim faith to similar aspects of the Jewish and Christian faiths. The author points out that much religious observance today comes not from the law of the religion but from the secular culture in which the religion originated. All who know little about the true Muslim faith or who believe it is a negative force in the world should definitely read this book.",
        "Liguorian",
        "Here is a rich cache of carefully researched data and well-organized information, wrapped in an accessible package.",
        "National Catholic Reporter",
        "Margot Patterson has taken on an impossible task and made a success of it. In 112 pages (plus an index and bibliography) she offers ‘a simple, readable account of the major tenets and practices of Islam,’ and an understanding of ‘why the West in general and the U.S. in particular are regarded with antagonism by some Muslims.’ Her book should help overcome the widespread ignorance of Islam by Catholics and other Christians, while making them more aware of the mistakes American policy-makers have made in dealing with countries with large Muslim populations.",
