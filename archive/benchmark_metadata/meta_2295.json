        "When nursing assistant Kerry Stine is blamed for the death of a hospital patient, her life goes into freefall - fired, wanted by the police, and a stranger is squatting in her apartment who believes she has a priceless historical treasure. Dr. Adrian Calhoun has developed a controversial cure for lung cancer, making him a target and a liability to the pharmaceutical industry. Kerry’s search for the truth about her squatter leads her to a different truth – about a part of her past she’s not ready to face and a precious jewel that can’t possibly be hers. Adrian must protect not only himself but his secret formula and his vulnerable control group, before Pharma gets to them first. In an unpredictable turn of events, the destinies of Adrian and Kerry collide to produce stunning revelations that change their lives forever."
