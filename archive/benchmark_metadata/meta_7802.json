        "From USA TODAY Bestselling author Terri Brisbin. . . .While magic still glimmered over the lands and people of Scotland and the Vikings ruled the western islands and the north, three brothers struggle against their fate to overcome a dreaded curse tied to their own Fae powers. Their hearts, souls and very lives depend on the women they betrayed. Connor has the ability to see the past, present and future and uses his gift for the benefit of his wealthy patron. But, it comes at a high price—his power first blinds him and then will kill him. . . if the woman intent on his death doesn’t get to him first. She claims he destroyed her family, but he only knows relief and pleasure when she is with him. Moira has lived to avenge her family’s destruction that the Seer caused. But captured and made his prisoner, she discovers he is not what he seems and yet is so much more. As she watches his dark power control him, Moira also finds a sensuality that draws her closer and closer and tempts her to put aside her vengeance.As darkness and danger gather around them and the curse of his Fae father reaches its deadly conclusion, will Connor and Moira find the love that could save them both? “Boldly sensual and richly emotional.” Booklist“Hot and compelling!” NYT Bestselling Author Madeline HunterThe Storm series: A Storm of Passion – Book 1A Storm of Love – novella – Book 2A Storm of Pleasure – Book 3Mistress of the Storm – Book 4This dark, emotional and steamy fantasy romance series set in medieval Scotland was previously published by Kensington Books in their Brava imprint and is now re-released by the author."
