        "Product Description",
        "\"Its skewed pop recalls Bowie?s Hunky Dory, and pinpoints the human cost of superpower recklessness, prompting a standing ovation for pop music?s most mercurial refusenik-turned-prodigal son? THE GUARDIAN (on a live performance of World Citizen). Longtime friends and collaborators David Sylvian and Ryuichi Sakamoto work together again on this latest release, 'world citizen'. There are five tracks included on ?world citizen?, in a different running order and with completely different artwork to the package that was released late last year by Warner Music Japan. Also included is a remix by acclaimed remixer Ryoji Ikeda.",
        "The songs were recorded in New York and New Hampshire, USA in the summer of 2003.",
        "Sylvian and Sakamoto have not released a record together for 21 years, which makes this a very special release. ?world citizen?, with its powerful lyrics and excellent melody, is a must have for all Sylvian and Sakamoto fans.",
        "About the Artist",
        "David Sylvian formed Japan in 1974 and served as their primary singer/songwriter throughout the group's eight-year existence. Following the 1982 dissolution of Japan, Sylvian staked out a far-ranging and esoteric career which encompassed not only solo projects but also a series of fascinating collaborative efforts and forays into filmmaking, photography and modern art. Just prior to Japan's break-up, Sylvian began working with composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, with whom he released the single \"Bamboo Houses\" in 1982, marking the beginning of a long-standing musical relationship. Sylvian released his solo debut, Brilliant Trees, in 1984, marking the first step in his music's evolution from Japan's post-glam synth-pop into richly-textured, poetic ambience, the album featured contributions from Sakamoto as well as Jon Hassell and Can alumnus Holger Czukay.",
        "A founding member of Yellow Magic Orchestra, Sakamoto's impact on the electronic music scene was solidified with his second solo release in 1980, B2-Unit, which included the seminal single Riot in Lagos, that has had a lasting influence on hip hop producers, remixers, and club crowds to this day. His career in film launched with the score for Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, and his 1987 score for Bertolucci?s The Last Emperor won him an Oscar and a Grammy. In 2003, Sakamoto explored a new electronic collaboration with German artist/musician Carsten Nicolai (a/k/a alva noto) for the release Vrioon, and continued his exploration of bossa nova with the release of Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto?s A Day in New York. In May, 2004, Sakamoto will release his 15th solo record, Chasm."
