        "Tagua Nut Necklace in Blue. Necklace Length: 38 inches Adjustable to shorter length. About Tagua This Product is handcrafted from a palm tree nut native to the lush tropical rainforests of Ecuador. Also referred to as the Ecuadorean Ivory Palm, the Tagua tree produces several bushels of seed pods a year with up to 100 Tagua nuts per pod. These nuts are then harvested, dried, and crafted into a wide range of products from vibrant modern jewelry, ornate figurines, to everyday items like shirt buttons. Also known as Vegetable Ivory, Tagua has the same appearance, density, and feel of animal ivory without doing any harm to any animals or the rainforests where it is gathered."
