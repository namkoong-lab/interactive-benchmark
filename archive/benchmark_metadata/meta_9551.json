        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreSchool-K-Harry the elephant and his friends Lulu (a lamb) and Ted (a bear) are soft toys, very soft. The three get ready for bed and snuggle up together. Lulu and Ted nod out immediately but sleep doesn't come to Harry. He patiently goes through an impressive repertoire of bedtime rituals from reading a story to running in place to stretching. When he rolls in a ball and unintentionally takes all the blankets, Lulu and Ted wake up. They soothe the restless creature and assure him that \"We're here, Harry.\" The three sit together companionably and quietly, watching the moon through the window. As the elephant dozes off at last, his friends wish him good night and sweet dreams, and curl up around him in bed. Lewis's meticulous illustrations were rendered in colored pencil and pastel, and the vivid, warm textures of the toys are sure to be appreciated by children. The expressive figures are plump and sweet looking, but never saccharine. This is a gentle book with illustrations that hum, and a bedtime story that's as warm as it is irresistible.",
