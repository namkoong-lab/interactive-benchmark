        "About the Author",
        "Joseph Hart has a BA in psychology, but did not finish graduate school, where his major was humanities, a major he preferred. For several years he had poems published in little magazines. His favorite publication was a 20 page blank verse on sleep in Audience Magazine. He was twice nominated for a Pushcart, but won neither time. His favorite poets are Keats, Brooke, Millay, Poe, and Eliot's \"Prufrock\"."
