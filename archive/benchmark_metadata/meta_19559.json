        "Ann Sothern goes husband hunting in a double feature of wisecracking romantic comedies that feature stellar supporting casts. In Smartest Girl in Town, Ann is a gold digger who thinks she has a heart of brass. When she falls for a wealthy playboy (Gene Raymond) she mistakes for a penniless nobody, she tries to ignore her all-too-human emotions to pursue an avian-obsessed Italian baron more interested in birds than in the birds and bees. Big laughs come from frequent Astaire-Rogers costars Helen Broderick, Eric Blore and Erik Rhodes. Next, Ann plays a riches-to-rags debutante facing a stack of her late daddy's lOUs in She's Got Everything. Her creditors cook up a madcap scheme to turn her new secretarial job with a coffee magnate (Gene Raymond) into a fulltime gig as Mrs. Millionaire. Helen Broderick, Victor Moore, Billy Gilbert and radio favourite Parkyakarkus lend top comedy support."
