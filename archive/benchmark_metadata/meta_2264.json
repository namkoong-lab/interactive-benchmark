        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Set in upstate New York in the middle of the 19th century, this refreshing historical romance combines a cast of colorful characters with an absorbing plot replete with accurate historical detail. Young Melisande Stevens travels from the English orphanage which has been her home since the age of seven to work as a servant in the house of an American physician. After the horrific Atlantic crossing, Melisande arrives only to find that the doctor's family has moved. Friendless and ill, she is rescued by the town's new physician, Dr. Adam Kingsley, who takes her into his household and, after she recovers, offers her a position as a domestic. The linguistically and musically gifted Melisande is clearly not housemaid material and, despite her attraction to Dr. Kingsley, she leaves his home determined to make her own way. What ensues makes for engrossing social history and a first-rate love story between two feisty, headstrong individuals--both with unspoken pasts. Questions are answered and secrets revealed in a completely unexpected plot twist which finds Melisande triumphing both musically and emotionally. Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "The author of Golden Destiny ( LJ 4/1/93) sets her new novel in upstate New York at the end of the last century. Beautiful 19-year-old Melisande leaves an English orphanage to become a maid for an American country doctor, only to find when she arrives that he has died and she will be working for his young replacement, Adam Kingsley. Intelligent, uniquely tutored as a child, and determined to become a teacher, Melisande achieves her goals against the backdrop of her thwarted love for Adam. Though Davies creates some interesting situations, and Mel is a young woman with grit, this never rises above the genre formula: beautiful, mysterious girl and handsome man with a past, destined to get together in the end. (They do.) Skip unless your readers clamor for historical romance.",

        "Melisande appears on the doorstep of Dr. Adam Kingsley in nineteenth-century upstate New York. She has been \"ordered\" from an English orphanage to work as a maid in the house that Kingsley now occupies, the previous owners having departed. Kingsley treats her for malnutrition and exposure to the cold, but when it is time for her to assume the role of parlor maid, the doctor is in for some serious surprises. Melisande runs away, becomes part of a slave-labor sewing industry, and finally reaches her goal of becoming a teacher. Of course, once the young woman reaches a fairly independent state, the romance between the doctor and waif is allowed to blossom. A pleasant tale, blessed with a historical setting that has not been done to death.",
