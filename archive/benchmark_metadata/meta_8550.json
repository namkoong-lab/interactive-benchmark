        "The book is not about the chair!The author's journey of making a museum-worthy chair from a stack of oak lumber becomes an allegory for self-exploration and restoration, paving a path from brokenness to wholeness. Mindful consideration of change, fear, acceptance, choice-making and belief through the process of making the chair encourages you to embark upon your own personal creative efforts. His ideas will enhance your life as you cook, bake, create, and build the future projects of your life. Creativity is a human birthright. Daily life in an office cubicle or at a computer keyboard often lacks embodied creative expression. Humans are genetically endowed with minds and methods to physically create and make real the important things of their lives that point to improved health and happiness. Head, heart and hands join together to bring forth a personally crafted vision. An anecdotal survey of our lifestyles and homes reflect few inspired personal expressions of our birthright as creative humans. We eat bread that someone else baked, move to music that someone else made. We acquire framed art rendered by others to hang on walls painted by someone else. Creative visions are not explored, container gardens are not planted, songs are not sung. We go to museums to marvel at tools and art that the ancients produced with their technology, while we, as descendants of these same people, question our ability to create similar visionary solutions for ourselves."

        "Enjoyed! An elegy to loss, recovery, creativity, and fearlessness--and chairs!  - Susan Piver is a Buddhist teacher, a student of Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche and the New York Times bestselling author of 9 books, most recently The Four Noble Truths of Love: Buddhist Wisdom for Modern Relationships.  Applies the guidance of the 4 Noble Truths of Buddhism to matters of the heart.This concise, lyrical book is much more than a 'how to' manual for building a piece of furniture, but the record of a heartfelt quest for authenticity in the whole personality. It is full of vital lessons on reclaiming our humanity from the ruling culture of artless fakery, and will benefit anyone who is serious about creative endeavor. You might even be inspired to build a chair. - James Howard Kunstler - author of the World Made By Hand novels and many other books.",

        "I encourage the reader of \"Zen and the Art of Making a Morris Chair\" to consider making by hand, as I did with the Morris Chair, as a way to reclaim yourself in the creative process, especially as an antidote to the stress and strain of living in the often inhuman digital electronic age.   My effort in making this chair by hand was a year long journey of starting, continuing and completing.  The creative process will be the same for your make by hand project.Make something in your life by hand as a bold response to the stress, self-doubt, feelings of being \"not enough\" that is pervasive in the 21st century.  Wean yourself from your digital device for a few moments to enter into your own creative process.  Humans have been making by hand for millennia as a way to survive.  21st century humans make by hand to thrive.  When you make by hand you will feel accomplished.  You will feel in control of your life.  Along the way you will learn about change, courage, acceptance, decision making, and personal belief.  You will find yourself prodded and provoked to consider a similar restorative make by hand journey where you will meet your creative spirit.  Make it your way !!!!",
