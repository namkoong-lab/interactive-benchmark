        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Followers of Cornwell's series featuring the exploits of British infantry officer Richard Sharpe (Sharpe's Rifles, et al.) in the Napoleonic wars (adapted for Masterpiece Theater) and in his earlier career in colonial India will relish this look at Sergeant Sharpe on the subcontinent in 1803. A fluke makes our hero unofficial aide to General Sir Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington, though it's never mentioned in the novel) at the time of the siege of Ahmednuggur and Wellesley's brilliant victory at Assaye against the Indian Mahratta Confederation and the turncoat forces of ex-English officer William Dodd. This was the beginning of the end of the Mahratta rebellion against the British and a turning point in the Raj's growing power. Among the book's rich cast of characters are Hakeswill, a murderous British sergeant determined to kill Sharpe; Simone Joubert, the needy wife of a French officer; and the colorful Hanoverian mercenary, Colonel Pohlmann, who leads the Mahratta forces from atop an elephant. Most roundly dimensional and representing the extremes of British society are Wellesley, the coldly brilliant and fearless son of an earl, and Sharpe himself, the tortured, unlettered bastard from London's slums, who is determined to rise. Cornwell contributes vivid details in descriptions of life in an army camp, the dual military regimes of the East India Company and the regular army, and Indian politics. Best are the battle scenes, laid out clearlyAthere's a handy mapAwith all the heat, stink and blood of war and \"the joys of slaughter.\" The reader's pleasure in all this gore may be a guilty one, but Cornwell, a master of battlefield writing, makes it too exhilarating to forgo. 15-city NPR feature; 3-city author tour.

        "Cornwell continues to luxuriate in the details of battle in his continuing series of novels following the exploits of British soldier-adventurer Sergeant Richard Sharpe. In this latest Sharpe novel, Cornwell leaves aside the Napoleonic wars in Europe to concentrate on the rich terrain of colonial India. The story starts with a tense situation. The time is 1803, and a league of native Indian princes called the Mahratta Confederation is determined to resist British encroachment into its territories. A large quantity of ammunition has been stolen from the East India Company, and the Mahrattas are poised to pay top price for the stolen goods for use in their British resistance. The ammo has been recaptured, and it is Sharpe's job to see that it is safely returned to where it belongs. A renegade British major allied to the Mahratta princes attacks the fort where the ammo has been taken, massacres everyone (except for Sharpe, who fakes death), and runs off with the highly negotiable commodity. Now Sharpe is ordered to hunt down this rogue, and the road ultimately leads to involvement in a major battle, authentically, even gracefully, reconstructed here with the electric prose Cornwell is known for. Eminently successful historical fiction.",

        "The marvelous Cornwell returns to his greatest character, British Army rifleman Richard Sharpe, after completing his Arthurian Warlord trilogy and the Starbuck Chronicles series, about the U.S. Civil War. In the most recent Sharpe adventure (",
        "Sharpe's Battle",
        ", 1995), set in May 1811, Captain Sharpe fought in the savage, three-day engagement against Napoleon's troops at the Battle of Fuentes de Oro. It's now eight years earlier, and Sharpe is a sargeant in India fighting beside Wellington at the Battle of Assaye, an engagement that Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, rated above his triumph over Napoleon at Waterloo. The British Army is preparing to attack India's Mahratta Confederation when the ragingly ambitious Lt. Dodd defects to the Confederation. But is it a real defection? Great banks of gunsmoke rise as the armies battle--until, at a village called Assaye, the enemy baits its trap for Wellington and draws him into the range of an array of infantry and of 80 heavy guns on a high bluff, and besides that into a village crammed with the Rajah of Berar's troops. By story's end, Sharpe is Ensign Sharpe, a commissioned officer. Cornwell's fans will dance with delight as horsemen charge and sabers swing through chaos and terror. --",

        "With the return of the brave English sergeant Richard Sharpe--here, to battle the mercenary forces of the Mahratta confederation in India in 1803--Bernard Cornwell claims his rightful place alongside Patrick O'Brian as a contemporary master of historical narrative.",
        "Sharpe's Triumph",
        "is a riveting story of betrayal and revenge that showcases the deft blend of suspenseful military adventure and sweeping historical detail that has made each new installment of the Richard Sharpe series a number one bestseller in Great Britain and around the world.",
        "In the four years since he earned his sergeant's stripes at the bloody siege of Seringapatam, young Richard Sharpe has lead a peaceful existence. But this relatively easy life meets with a brutal end when he is the sole survivor of a murderous attack at the hands of Major William Dodd, a cold-blooded English officer who has defected from the East India Company to join the mercenary forces of the Mahratta confederation.",
        "Sharpe rises from the killing field at Fort Chasalgaon vowing to avenge his dead comrades, even if it means pursuing the turncoat Dodd to the very ends of the continent. It is a quest that takes him deep into the heart of enemy territory, where the accepted rules of engagement have been discarded, where ever-shifting loyalties create an environment of dangerous uncertainty, forcing Sharpe to guard against attacks from enemy and friend.",
        "The paths of treachery ultimately lead to the small village of Assaye, where Sharpe's company joins the army of Sir Arthur Wellesley--the future Duke of Wellington--to take on the Mahratta horde. Outnumbered and outgunned, Wellesley bravely seizes an unexpected geographical advantage and charges into the white heat of a battle that will make his reputation. It is a bloody confrontation that will make Sharpe's name, too--but first he must survive the carnage and live to tell the tale of what will be remembered as one of the greatest battles of its century.",

Each blast of powder fountained sparks and ashes into the hot air. A couple of men laughed at the sight. They stopped to watch it for a few seconds, poked at the nearby bodies with their muskets, then walked on.",
        "Sharpe lay still. A fly crawled on his eyeball and he forced himself to stay absolutely motionless.

        "Sharpe had come from Seringapatam, leading a detail of six privates and carrying a leather bag stuffed with rupees, and he had been greeted by Major Crosby who commanded at Chasalgaon. The Major proved to be a plump, red-faced, bilious man who disliked the heat and hated Chasalgaon, and he had slumped in his canvas chair as he unfolded Sharpe's orders. He read them, grunted, then read them again. \"Why the hell did they send you?\" he finally asked.",

        "Crosby frowned at the order. \"Why not an officer?\"",
        "\"No officers to spare, sir.\"",
        "\"Bloody responsible job for a sergeant, wouldn't you say?\"",
        "\"Won't let you down, sir,\" Sharpe said woodenly, staring at the leprous yellow of the tent's canvas a few inches above the Major's head.",
        "\"You'd bloody well better not let me down,\" Crosby said, pushing the orders into a pile of damp papers on his camp table. \"And you look bloody young to be a sergeant.\"",
        "\"I was born late, sir,\" Sharpe said. He was twenty-six, or thought he was, and most sergeants were much older.",
        "Crosby, suspecting he was being mocked, stared up at Sharpe, but there was nothing insolent on the Sergeant's face. A good-looking man, Crosby thought sourly. Probably had the",

        "of Seringapatam falling out of their saris, and Crosby, whose wife had died of the fever ten years before and who consoled himself with a two-rupee village whore every Thursday night, felt a pang of jealousy. \"And how the devil do you expect to get the ammunition back to Seringapatam?\" he demanded.",
        "\"Hire ox carts, sir.\" Sharpe had long perfected the way to address unhelpful officers. He gave them precise answers, added nothing unnecessary and always sounded confident.",
        "\"With what? Promises?\"",
        "\"Money, sir.\" Sharpe tapped his haversack where he had the bag of rupees.",
        "\"Christ, they trust you with money?\"",
        "Sharpe decided not to respond to that question, but just stared impassively at the canvas. Chasalgaon, he decided, was not a happy place. It was a small fort built on a bluff above a river that should have been overflowing its banks, but the monsoon had failed and the land was cruelly dry. The fort had no ditch, merely a wall made of cactus thorn with a dozen wooden fighting platforms spaced about its perimeter. Inside the wall was a beaten-earth parade ground where a stripped tree served as a flagpole, and the parade ground was surrounded by three mud-walled barracks thatched with palm, a cookhouse, tents for the officers and a stone-walled magazine to store the garrison's ammunition. The sepoys had their families with them, so the fort was overrun with women and children, but Sharpe had noted how sullen they were. Crosby, he thought, was one of those crabbed officers who were only happy when all about them were miserable.",
        "\"I suppose you expect me to arrange the ox carts?\" Crosby said indignantly.",
        "\"I'll do it myself, sir.\"",
        "\"Speak the language, do you?\" Crosby sneered. \"A sergeant, banker and interpreter, are you?\"",
        "\"Brought an interpreter with me, sir,\" Sharpe said. Which was overegging the pudding a bit, because Davi Lal was only thirteen, an urchin off the streets of Seringapatam. He was a smart, mischievous child whom Sharpe had found stealing from the armory cookhouse and, after giving the starving boy a clout around both ears to teach him respect for His Britannic Majesty's property, Sharpe had taken him to Lali's house and given him a proper meal, and Lali had talked to the boy and learned that his parents were dead, that he had no relatives he knew of, and that he lived by his wits. He was also covered in lice. \"Get rid of him,\" she had advised Sharpe, but Sharpe had seen something of his own childhood in Davi Lal and so he had dragged him down to the River Cauvery and given him a decent scrubbing. After that Davi Lal had become Sharpe's errand boy. He learned to pipeclay belts, blackball boots and speak his own version of English which, because it came from the lower ranks, was liable to shock the gentler born.",
