        "\"When Step Met Skip by Vicky Weber is an adorable children's book that provides a great introduction to the concepts required for reading and writing music. The fun characters, Step and Skip, are full of personality, as they explore the musical staff. Step is calculated and seems nervous about taking risks. Skip, in contrast, is carefree and enjoys experimenting. When the two characters try each other's preferred methods of moving along the staff, each is in for a surprise! While different, Step and Skip learn to work together to create something wonderful!When Step Met Skip offers an opportunity to learn the exciting terminology related to music. Children can use the context clues (and fun illustrations by Genevieve Viel-Taschereau) to understand the potentially unfamiliar terms, including staff, harmony, and melody. The shift between the initial meeting of Skip and Step, to their decision to move together along the staff, is expertly shown with a change from the stark white lines to full-color spreads. The author is a music teacher, and with this new title, she offers her colleagues a great way to add to their curriculum. The book is a perfect segue between core subjects (language arts) and the special subject of music that children are offered at the elementary level.\"",
