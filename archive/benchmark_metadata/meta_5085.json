        "A FILTHY TWIST TO THE GAME TERRIBLE DATES. The Dark Expansion Pack adds 75 really nasty cards to Red Flags. Red Flags is an adult party game about convincing your friends to go on terrible dates. This Your goal is to use Perks to create the ultimate date for The Single. It’s the perfect matchmaking set up… until the other players introduce Red Flags to try and sabotage another player's hot date.",
        "MATCHMAKING TIME. Each round gets one ‘single’ player, who will act as judge for the round. Everyone else draws FOUR Perks and THREE Red Flags each. Using what they know about the Single, these matchmakers will pick two Perks to create the best date possible for The Single, like “OWNS 100 HORSES” and “THEIR KISSES CURE CANCER”.",
        "WOW THAT TOOK A DARK TURN. This is where the plot thickens. After all Perks are read, beginning the player to the Single's left, each player plays a Red Flag onto the player to their left, for some pretty interesting developments in their characters and backstories. Players will have a CRAZY time with new Red Flag cards like: SWEATS SEMEN, and “DOESN’T LIKE MUSIC... ANY OF IT.” Yikes. Players can then argue why the Single should pick their character over the others.",
        "GREAT FOR PARTIES AND ADULT GAMES NIGHT. Maybe you’ll consider staying single after a few rounds, but you’ll definitely get to know your friends more! The game can be as raunchy or tame as imagination allows. This easy to learn tabletop game is awesome to play with friends during: adult games night, office party, sleepovers, birthdays, drinking games, dinner parties, stag nights and bachelorette parties.",
        "WHAT’S INSIDE THE DARK EDITION. This expansion to Red Flags adds 75 horribly offensive cards to shuffle into your deck of Red Flag cards. This deck is not for the faint of heart, or the easily offended, and we apologize for the trauma you're about to inflict on your friends."

        "This expansion to Red Flags adds 75 horribly offensive cards to shuffle into your deck of Red Flag cards to royally mess up your competition! This deck is not for the faint of heart, or the easily offended and we apologize for the trauma you're about to inflict on your friends. From Skybound Games and Darin Ross, the creator of the classic hit party game Superfight, comes Red Flags -- a party game about convincing your friends to go on terrible dates. Here's how it works: One of your friends is going to be the Single. Every other player uses perk cards to make a hot date that they think would be a great match for that person. You'll get characters like: “a brain surgeon” that “loves to cuddle”, an “Olympic gymnast” that is a “great conversationalist”, and a “famous musician” that “owns your favorite sports team”. But then everyone gets to play a Red Flag onto another player at the table. Now all these perfect dates will have flaws like: “wears a diaper because it’s \"more convenient,\" or “always brags about past sexual conquests”, “punches every barista they see”, or “collects human skulls”. Now that all the dates are horrible, everyone tries to convince the Single to go out with their date! The game can be as raunchy or tame as your imaginations allow!"
