        "\"Meg Anne weaves an intricate tale that sucks you in with its increasingly mounting tension and doesn't let go until you have been on one hell of a ride. As before, we are left starving for more of her incredible story.\"",
        "- Heather Guimond, Author",
        "\"This series had me on the edge of my seat. I absolutely love that the hero is a bad ass woman with an axe to grind. The author took me to a world filled with action, suspense and fantasy and I really want to stay there. Kudos to Meg Anne for an amazing series.\"",
        "- Cranky, The Book Curmudgeon Blog",
        "About the Author",
        "Meg Anne has always had stories running on a loop in her head. They started off as daydreams about how the evil queen (aka Mom) had her slaving away doing chores; and more recently shifted into creating backgrounds about the people stuck beside her during rush hour. The stories have been there, they were just waiting for her to tell them. Like any true SoCal native, Meg enjoys staying inside curled up with a good book and her cat Henry... or maybe that's just her; sunburns hurt! You can convince Meg to buy just about anything if it's covered in glitter or rhinestones, or make her laugh by sharing your favorite bad joke. She also accepts bribes in the form of baked goods and Mexican food."
