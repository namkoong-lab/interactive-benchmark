        "Manchester-based Serena, now eighteen and pregnant, discovers the shocking reason why Tile X has befriended her. She doesn’t like what she hears. Mayhem ensues, with a retired Irish police superintendent becoming more involved than perhaps he should have. The Hostile Game is the third book in The Hostile series of gripping paranormal thrillers. Each book in this unusual series can be read as a standalone. Magical realism.\"Now I know why I am hooked on this series. The story in each of the books so far is not more of the same. Each book steps up to another level, just when you think it couldn't get any worse.\"\"I enjoy stories that break with convention, and once again, Joy Mutter delivers another wonderfully offbeat, paranormal thriller, mellowed with a delicious dark humour.\""

        "About the Author",
        "Joy Mutter was born in Jersey in the Channel Islands and lived there for eighteen years. After gaining a Graphic Design Degree at Coventry University, she lived and worked in Kent as a professional graphic designer for twenty years. Joy moved from Kent to Oldham in 2012 and has been writing and publishing her books full-time since then. Although Joy has been writing books since 2007, she waited until 2015 to publish six of them on Amazon. Four more books followed in 2016 and one in 2017. All twelve are now available on Amazon in paperback and Kindle editions. Eight are also available as audiobooks on Audible, iTunes, and Amazon. Her first three books are mainly autobiographical and form The Mug Trilogy. Books in this series are A Slice of the Seventies, The Lying Scotsman, and Straws. Her fourth work, Potholes and Magic Carpets, is a character-led contemporary novel. Living with Postcards is the author's first non-fiction book. Random Bullets is a paranormal crime thriller and the author's favourite of all her books. Her demonic Angel was published in early 2016. It's a baker's dozen of the author's short stories, written in various genres. In April 2016, Joy published an unusual paranormal crime thriller called The Hostile. In December 2016, she published book two of The Hostile series, called Holiday for The Hostile. In April 2017, Joy published The Hostile Game, book three of the series. In August 2017, she published book four, Confronting The Hostile and The Hostile Series Box Set. There are audiobook editions of four books in The Hostile series, Random Bullets, Her demonic Angel, Potholes and Magic Carpets, and A Slice of the Seventies. There are more books in the pipeline as she's never short of ideas.",
