        "The shoulder tube provides the overhand athlete an ideal way to condition and prepare the shoulder for the act of throwing. The deliberate oscillation of the shoulder tube in a slow, rhythmic fashion by moving the arm will cause the counterweighted ends of the shoulder tube to change directions stretching (eccentric phase) and shortening (concentric phase) the affected muscle group. The position of the shoulder tube and the direction it is flexed determines the muscle groups that are exercised. Controlling the Omni-directional movement of the counter weights as the device is being moved through the shoulder's full range of motion causes increased flexibility and blood flow to the shoulder complex. The construction and flexibility of the round shaft device permits the athlete to exercise the shoulder at an intensity that is self determined. The more energy that is used to move the device results in greater energy levels returned to the shoulder by the rotational motion of the counterweights. Using the shoulder tube is a Great way to warm up for the act of throwing or cool down afterwards. It is an essential tool for the health and durability of all throwing athletes."
