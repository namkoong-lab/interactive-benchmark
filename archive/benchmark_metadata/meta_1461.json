        "2 Year Warranty on parts and Labor Lightweight upright vacuum cleaners have a bad reputation for being hard to handle or easily breakable. Sanitaire’s S635 has set out to prove that assumption wrong. Using heavy duty metal pieces where the vacuum needs it most and durable plastics everywhere else, the S635 is easy to move but hard to break. The powerful five-amp motor can stand up to any mess but is great on energy consumption and noise levels. A large 11-quart dust capacity, 12-inch cleaning path and 30-foot power cord strive to help you clean more without stopping for maintenance or a new power outlet. With the freedom to roam and the unmatched cleaning capabilities of the Sanitaire line, the S635 is one of the most convenient vacuum for businesses everywhere. Sanitaire’s advanced airflow system and porous bags allow for great collection as well as cleaning power, even as the bag fills. The bags are easy to change and do not require any tools, however, once they are put on properly they do not let any dust or dirt out of it. Even during changes, the bags are hygienic and powerful. The bag, belt and brush roll are all designed to be easily changed to prevent costly maintenance and time at a repair shop. Sanitaire offers a two year warranty on the S635’s motor, base, parts and labor. At a competitive price for all of its cleaning power, you will love this vacuum."
