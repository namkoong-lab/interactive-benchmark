        "The 1800 Watt Portable Power Station and Simultaneous Battery Charger allows for AC power in remote locations for convenient portable power. Able to run most corded tools, it provides 1800 Watts (15 amps) continuous power and 3600 Watts peak power. The DCB1800B runs on four DEWALT 20V MAX* batteries (including FLEXVOLT), and for high power applications, four 20V MAX* 3.0Ah DEWALT Batteries (DCB200) or higher amp hour are recommended to provide the best results. Not only can the 1800 Watt Portable Power Station power a corded tool remotely, but it also becomes a multi-port simultaneous charger for up to four DEWALT 20V MAX* Batteries (including FLEXVOLT) when plugged into a wall outlet via extension cord (batteries and extension cord sold separately). Compact and lightweight, the 1800 Watt Portable Power Station weighs just 18lbs (without batteries) and is easily portable. Without the need for gas to run, there are no fumes or carbon monoxide emitted from the device. In addition, the 1800 Watt Portable Power Station can be used to provide temporary power in areas where noise is restricted such as a jobsite with strict regulations. With an integrated temperature-controlled cooling fan and heavy-duty roll cage, the Portable Power Station is a durable and convenient power solution for a variety of uses."
