        "(1999) will find this debut novel just as tantalizing. Cassandra \"Cassie\" Rivers and Leila Aponte are two high-school rivals turned best friends who set out to make a career as a hip-hop duo. G Double D, owner of the recording studio Explicit Content, breaks up the duo by signing Leila without Cassie. Being betrayed by her best friend only intensifies Cassie's determination, and she persuades G Double D to sign her to a solo deal. Once she becomes a part of the Explicit Content family, she learns that the industry rumors about the company's shady business practices are true. With the help of her mother, Cassie succeeds in bringing down that musical empire, reuniting with her best friend, and freeing the other women who have been victimized by Explicit Content's underground business dealings. Full of suspense and twists, this a page-turner of an urban story about friendship and the importance of being patient and doing things the right--not quick--way.",
