        "\"With three very distinct story threads to take care of, Kraken - Volume 2 must have been Hawthorne's most challenging book to write to date. With each thread focusing on a different theme; battle, discovery and intrigue,there is quite a lot going on, but no plot strand ever feels less fleshed out than the others, meaning the reader never feels a sense of wanting to 'get back to the good stuff'. Each of our related stories is equally gripping, a testament to how Hawthorne has developed as a writer over time . . . While Kraken - Volume 2 has plenty of twists, turns and mysteries to be explored, fans who read for the sake of the near Kaiju-esque battle sequences between larger than life monstrosities will not be disappointed. Highlights include a cataclysmic encounter between a nuclear submarine and a giant octopus, as well as, for the first time in the series, the introduction of fierce land-based creatures (just when you thought it was safe to get out of the water). All of these are tackled with the gusto and excitement that we have come to expect of a Max Hawthorne novel",

        "'page turner' is an understatement! Equally rivaling the likes of Crichton's 'Jurassic World', Benchley's 'Jaws' and Alten's 'MEG' book and movie franchises,'Kraken V2' truly earns its proverbial place on the shelf! Hawthorne is,indeed, a deserving member of that celebrated group of storytellers, and Hollywood film producers will, no doubt, SOON be all over HIS literary franchise! Hawthorne's 'Kraken V2' reads like a bullet train thrill ride from the first gripping page and takes you hostage until the explosive end! Hawthorne's original characters possess the dimension and sparkle,deserving of a cast of Hollywood's top A-list stars to bring them to life on the big screen! It's brilliant storytelling and THE way a story should be told! Now, that's entertainment!!!",
