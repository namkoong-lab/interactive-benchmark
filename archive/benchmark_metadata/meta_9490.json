It is a captivating and creative story of past and present with beautifully intertwined story lines. It's so well written and easy to read while still keeping you intrigued as to how everything will play out. Loved it!!",
        "Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. This book has it all....humor, adventure, excitement, love and loss. I'm looking forward to his second book already.",
        "Past, present, and hope for the future are beautifully woven together in this book. I was so engaged that I literally did not put it down from start to finish!",
        "A quick read full of adventure, hope, and love. Highly recommend!",
        "When you can't seem to find a good stopping point, it must be a good book.",
        "I read this book simply to enjoy the written word. It was a compelling story woven into the experiences of a dedicated hospitalist and his love of history. His descriptions of a day in the life of a doctor, the history of the Incas, and his care for a victim of childhood cancer set the stage for the adventures in a search for hidden treasure.",
        "﻿Wouldn't it be a better place if there were more Doctors like Dr Beck. This book makes you laugh and cry, holds your attention till the very end. I can't believe this is a first time author, congratulations Dr Deweese well done.",
