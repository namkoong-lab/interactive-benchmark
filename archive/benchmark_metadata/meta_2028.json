And a beautiful reflection of the values that we've stood for, for the past 125 years: Passion: For the right kitchen tool, love of nature and good food, and the desire to inspire people. We know that this makes the best in quality, good design and highly developed functionality key principles for each and every one of our products. That is what we stand for. With unparalleled experience, with a high standard, or with the fact that we test each of our products in close collaboration with professionals. And we stand for that special attitude that makes us the 'brand of the century' - the attitude for which we are award-winning. This is where we live the joy of innovation. Something that propels us onward as we peer over the shoulders of people and time itself. Life has changed. We want to keep the good things while drawing on fresh ideas to make life easier and the joie de vivre even greater. A wonderful example of this is the pleasure of the great outdoors - or, more to the point, our new Grill series. And a splendid confirmation of this are the many enthusiastic responses by customers and the prestigious awards we have received. We'd like to continue in this vein. You are cordially invited to join us in celebrating life and the gourmet pleasures it holds in store. Or as our brand puts it so concisely: Love. Cook. Live.",
