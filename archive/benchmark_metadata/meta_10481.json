        "Italy's SWINGROWERS are back! HYBRID is their 4th album and perhaps their best yet! A lyrically ambitious project, where the previous album Outsidein looked inward to themes of identity and the effects of the internet age on the psyche, Hybrid chooses instead to look outward towards the stars and global ecological themes. But what really sets this all apart is the brilliant melodic work of a tightly-knit group working perfectly together. Add exemplary musicianship in the gypsy guitar work and alto sax department, coupled with a gorgeous voice and brilliant, original production work. This album is their masterpiece. Available on limited edition vinyl with full colour inner sleeve and lyric sheet, or ecological card-sleeve digipack. The songs take influences from vintage vocal jazz, electro swing and future pop to create a unique blend of styles both familiar yet new. But the music speaks best for itself. Turn it up loud and give it a listen."
