        "About the Author",
        "I have been creating stories in my head for as along as I can remember and as soon as I was able to write, pages and pages of barely legible writing began taking over my life. Luckily, my penmanship improved... no, it really didn't. Luckily, I have learned to type and now I can actually read the words I have written without a super duper secret decoder ring or a translator that is able to read midnight scribblings Thanks to more recent technological advances, I have been able to self-publish my paranormal romances and urban fantasies. I have also been trying to navigate the world of indie publishing and that has been interesting. At times it has been very fun, at other times it has been an exercise in futility. Every time I think I have it figured out, I learn something new that changes everything and I have to re-evaluate what I have done and see if I need to make any major changes or if I can use what I already have or if I have to scrap the whole thing. Whether writing, publishing, marketing or just living, that is pretty much how it goes and the learning just never seems to end. Thank God!! In the mean time I will just keep putting up lightning rods. I am eternally grateful for the brave souls who take a chance on an unknown author. Thank you! I currently have four books available: Darkness Comes (Feb. 2012), Blight (Mar. 2012), Stone Lover (Mar. 2012) and Siren Song (May 2012)",

Each book likes to be created in its own way, which makes establishing an environment that is most conducive to writing quite difficult, though it occasionally involves Dove chocolates, music, minesweeper, lots of solitaire, notebooks and scraps of paper, doodling and day dreaming, and fruity, sugar-free bubble gum, not necessarily in that order and not always at the same time.', \"Of course, none of this would be possible without the love and support of my very loving and very tolerant family, who politely listen as I go on and on about my characters' motivations and back stories, their connections within the worlds created and how they fight to gain control of their destinies. But I am a cruel writer and make them earn their happy endings.\", 'Since I am also a Romantic at heart, they are all happy endings.', 'Available Books:', 'Darkness Comes (Darkness book 1-PNR)', 'Darkness Falls (Darkness book 2 - PNR)', 'Stone Lover (Stone Passion Trilogy book 1 -PNR, romantica)', 'Stone Romance (Stone Passion Trilogy book 2 -PNR, romantica)', 'Stone Destiny (Stone Passion Trilogy book 3 - PNR, romantica)', 'Siren Song (PNR)', 'Stone Solitude (Stone Passion Twins book 1 - PNR, romantica)', 'Stone Seduction (Stone Passion Twins book 2 - PNR, romantica)', 'Awakening (PNR/UF)', 'Blight (UF)', 'After Blight (Blight book 2 - UF)', 'Blind Attraction (Contemporary)', \"Winter's Heart (STEAMY Contemporary)\", 'A Million Kisses or More (Contemporary)', 'I love hearing from readers.', 'Email me at: acwarneke@yahoo.com', 'or connect on facebook: www.facebook.com/ACWarneke', 'or visit my blog and leave a comment: acwarneke.com']}"
