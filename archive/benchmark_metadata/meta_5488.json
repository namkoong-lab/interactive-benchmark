        "As a leading OE supplier to the automotive industry, Delphi holds more than 30 OE-proprietary innovations and 150 patents in fuel module and pump design. As a result, our fuel pumps restore fast-pressure performance and system integrity to provide better pumping through less energy. Delphi fuel pumps feature internal springs for increased durability and enhanced stability, while a lower amperage draw places less load on a vehicle’s electrical system. Our fuel pumps include a large volume reservoir to better handle low-fuel situations and vehicle cornering, as well as fuel-level, gold-filled sensors for improved corrosion resistance. Other benefits of our fuel pumps include consistent pump flow, an enhanced filtration system for longer pump life and an OE-service body harness and connector for superior performance, durability and ease of installation."
