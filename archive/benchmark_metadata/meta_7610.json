        "About the Author",
        "David Rothel's lifelong fascination with show business began with frequent visits to his local movie theater, where he followed the adventures of his favorite screen heroes. He has since gone from youthful observer to performer, theater producer/director, teacher, and published authority on various aspects of popular entertainment (eleven books in twenty-three years). Mr. Rothel's most recent books have been The Gene Autry Book and The Roy Rogers Book, both reference-trivia-scrapbooks and extremely popular with Mr. Rothel's readers; the revised editions of Lash LaRue, The King of the Bullwhip and Allan \"Rocky\" Lane, Republic's Action Ace, co-written with Chuck Thornton; An Ambush of Ghosts:, A Personal Guide to Favorite Western Film Locations, to which film historian Leonard Maltin devoted two Entertainment Tonight segments; and Tim Holt, a biography of the popular RKO Western star. Mr. Rothel has been married to his wife Nancy for over thirty years, has three children (Michael, Christopher, and Laura) and four grandchildren (Adam, Ryan, Nicholas, and Alixandra). Mr. Rothel's writing is characterized by thoroughness of research, warmth, wit, and understanding."

He has since gone from youthful observer to published authority on various aspects of popular entertainment, all of which is reflected in his thirteen books on show business history. Through the years David has been an educator teaching speech, drama, and language arts in both Ohio and Florida. He was director of the federally-funded Sarasota Visual and Performing Arts Center, a magnet school for students interested in the arts. From the 1970s through 2003, David interviewed dozens of show business personalities for his radio program \"Nostalgia Newsbreak\" in Sarasota, Florida, and for \"Guest Star\" panels at film festivals where he was the moderator. He drew from those interviews/conversations for his 2010 book, \"Opened Time Capsules: My Vintage Conversations with Show Business Personalities.\" David has been a professional theatre producer/director in Florida for the Players Theatre in Sarasota and from 2004 to 2008 in Georgia for the Black Bear Dinner Theatre. He has produced and directed such shows as \"Hello Dolly,\" \"Irving Berlin\\'s White Christmas,\" \"Oliver!,\" \"The Music Man,\" \"Disney\\'s Beauty and the Beast,\" and in 2007 directed and performed the role of King Arthur in a Black Bear Dinner Theatre production of the musical \"Camelot.\" David\\'s fascination with the western film genre caused him to research and write books on many of the leading stars of those films. He had the opportunity to personally interview Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, and other leading and supporting players for his books. David\\'s book on western film locations, \"An Ambush of Ghosts: a Personal Guide to Favorite Western Film Locations,\" was twice featured in Leonard Maltin segments on \"Entertainment Tonight.\" His book \"The Singing Cowboys\" led to an appearance on NPR\\'s \"All Things Considered.\" The BBC\\'s \"Omnibus\" television series featured David\\'s book \"The Great Show Business Animals\" on one of its programs. David\\'s latest book, \"The Case Files of the Oriental Sleuths: Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, and Mr. Wong,\" was nominated for \"Book of the Year\" by the Rondo Awards for achievement in monster/mystery/sci-fi-related literature. In March of 2012 David Rothel received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Williamsburg Film Festival \"for His Dedication and Outstanding Contributions in Honoring the Golden Age of Hollywood.\"', 'David and his wife Nancy live in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Dahlonega, Georgia.']}"
