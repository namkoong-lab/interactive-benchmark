        "About the Author",
        "Jarrell Liner is a native of Atlanta, GA. Jarrell's passion for helping people perform at their best stems from a life of pain, disappointments, and the acceptance of low expectations in his own life for years. No matter how bad things got in his life, Jarrell knew in his spirit that there was something more out there for not only himself, but for everyone around him. He refused to settle for second best and his determination eventually led him to persevere through his situations, overcome his obstacles, get rid of his excuses, and use his wisdom to become an accomplished business man. Today he is a business owner, motivational speaker, and life coach, using his testimony of triumph as a force to inspire and encourage people of all ages. His technique is to always pull directly from his experiences in life. He has been through many of the same personal, financial, and career challenges that his audiences have endured. Jarrell has \"been there\" and he consistently uses elements of his personal journey of pain, failure, and embarrassment to connect with people and motivate them to never give up and to reject excuses in their lives. Jarrell is passionate about making this world a better place by using his gift to encourage and uplift those that are in the same places that he has been in life. He is thankful for the chance to have come from where he came from and to be where he is. Jarrell understands that if you are blessed, it is your responsibility to reach out and bless others."
