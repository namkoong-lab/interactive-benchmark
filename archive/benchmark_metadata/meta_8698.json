        "Passion, hope, and forbidden desire...",
        "Holly Jennings wasn't planning on another trip to Scotland. And she certainly wasn't planning on a trip down memory lane with the hot Highlander who broke her heart. But she's never been much of a planner - more like a roll-with-the punches country gal. A good thing too, because \"one last request\" may not be the only thing a beloved mentor left her in his will. Before Holly knows it, she's heading on a mysterious mission to a remote island - and straight into danger.",
        "Dragon shifter Lachlan McKenney likes his life logical and organized - not turned upside down by the impulsive beauty he's been trying to forget for years. Especially now that he's busy guarding a ruthless archenemy who's plotting to escape an island prison.",
        "But Holly awakens every emotion Lachlan has been trained to resist: passion, hope, and forbidden desire. It seems there's no outrunning fate, just as there's no shirking duty. Against the odds, Lachlan must keep Holly safe on her mission to carry out a venerable old dragon's last wishes. At the same time, he must resist temptation, because letting his focus slip could cost Holly her life - and unleash a deadly foe.",

Those women are absolutely off-limits to the young warriors tasked with protecting them. But destiny, of course, has other ideas...",
