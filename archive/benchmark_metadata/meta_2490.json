Currently residing with wife in Bullfrog, UT as an IT for Aramark. My wife and I are Vegans, which you might have guessed if you read Shalilayo. I love to write science fiction, compose music, dabble in electronics, explore caves, program and design web sites. My greatest hope in life is to see humans take the next step into sentient awareness and become a welcome species in the galactic neighborhood. The greatest part of my life is my wife, Marlaine, who has been with me for more lives than just about anyone else. If you are familiar with the character named Riah in Shalilayo, you will have an insight to what kind of person Marlaine is.']}"
