    "description": [
        "With a long history of diesel fuel injection expertise and innovation, Bosch leads the way in glow plug technology with its patented Duraterm dual control coil design. This technology utilizes a self-regulating system that reduces glow wait time by more than 50%. The patented dual control regulating and heating coil system effectively directs current draw, enabling the glow plug to reach higher temperatures more quickly for faster engine start-up. For vehicles with a post-glow control system, this advanced technology results in a post-glow heating phase which allows for more efficient overall engine performance."
