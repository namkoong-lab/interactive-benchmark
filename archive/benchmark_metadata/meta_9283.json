        ", her fifth collection of poetry, Enid Shomer continues to explore her passionate relationship with the Florida landscape, the inextricable web of family, and the challenges of the body. While studded with the austere recognitions of growing older, these poems are punctuated by humor and play―formally elegant and inventive, beautifully textured and nuanced. Throughout the book, Shomer employs the  language of science and Eros to uncover the exquisite truths of pain and pleasure."
