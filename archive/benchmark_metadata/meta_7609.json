        "The companion volume to the highly successful Cambridge History of Medieval Political Thought, this book presents a comprehensive account of the development of European political thinking through the Renaissance and the Reformation to the \"scientific revolution\" and political upheavals of the seventeenth century. Recent decades have seen intensive historical investigation and reappraisal in this field. Many established perspectives have changed; and while it would still be generally accepted that something distinctly \"modern\" took shape in the political thought of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there have been important changes in our understanding of what is \"medieval\" and what is \"modern\" and of the relationship between these concepts. A highly distinguished team of contributors present a unique, authoritative guide to these developments. Full bibliographical and biographical information is provided for those wishing to pursue specific topics in greater detail."

        "Review",
        "\"The first and most important thing to observe about the present volume is its exceptional usefulness as a competent survey of a host of political ideas and thinkers of the early modern era...warmly recommended.\" Renaissance Quarterly\"Meticulously researched, the book manages to cover two and a half centuries while avoiding superficiality. For years to come scholars will pull this volume off the shelf to read summaries of periods outside their field of primary interest and for some novel insights in their realm of expertise.\" Modern Europe\"...valuable volume..new scholarship on the history of political thought...essays by an impressive group of scholars...The volume reflects the current interpretations and interests of preeminent historians. It constitutes an important contribution to historical scholarship and should be read by all students of modern political thought.\" The Sixteenth Century Journal",
