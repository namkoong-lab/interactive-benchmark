        "An acclaimed international bestseller, The Perfume Garden is a sensuously written story of lost love, family secrets—and the art of creating a perfect scent.",
        "High in the hills of Valencia, a forgotten house guards its secrets. Untouched since Franco's forces tore through Spain in 1936, the whitewashed walls have crumbled, and the garden, laden with orange blossom, grows wild. Emma Temple is the first to unlock its doors in seventy years. Emma is London's leading perfumier, but her blessed life has taken a difficult turn. Her free-spirited mother, Liberty, who taught her the art of fragrance making, has just passed away. At the same time, she broke up with her long-time lover and business partner, Joe, whose baby she happens to be carrying.While Joe is in New York trying to sell his majority share in their company, Emma, guided by a series of letters and a key bequeathed to her in Liberty's will, decides to leave her job and travel to Valencia, where she will give birth in the house her mother mysteriously purchased just before her death. The villa is a perfect retreat: redolent with the exotic scents of orange blossom and neroli, dappled with light and with the rich colors of a forgotten time. Emma makes it her mission to restore the place to its former glory. But for her aging grandmother, Freya, a British nurse who stayed in Valencia during Spain's devastating civil war, Emma's new home evokes memories of a terrible secret, a part of her family's past that until now has managed to stay hidden. With two beautifully interwoven narratives and a lush, atmospheric setting, Kate Lord Brown's The Perfume Garden is a dramatic, emotional debut that readers won't soon forget."

        "Praise for The Perfume Garden \"Sweepingly romantic ... heartbreaking at times; a vivid, gripping read.\" --Katherine Webb, international bestselling author of The Legacy \"I found myself bewitched by The Perfume Garden ... a deliciously winding narrative that takes us into the heart of battle, the locked rooms of family secrets, and the alluring promise of finally finding true love.\" --Good Housekeeping (UK) \"The novel is beautifully constructed, with the characters' individual experiences gradually weaving together, and the events of the past unfolding to reveal aftershocks in Emma's present...

If you like stories which bring to life forgotten history and weave together amazing true events with page turning fiction you've come to the right place. I'm always looking for the 'diamond in the dust heap' as Woolf put it - those irresistible events which make you think: why doesn't everybody know about this?\", \"Like most writers, I've always loved reading. In fact my earliest memory is reading a Ladybird book in a wildflower meadow, wearing a pair of red shoes. I've always written since I was a child - diaries, plays for toys and I was roped in to write love letters on the school bus for friends to give their boyfriends, which may well be why I ended up writing hist fic with a strong romantic element. My first story was published while I was still at school. Later on I joined a writers' group in London which used to meet in the basement of Nomad travel bookstore once a week, and I began writing my first novel. I used to get up an hour before work and type away in the corridor of our studio flat with my keyboard balanced on a drawer.\", \"Wherever we have travelled our books have come too, and after twenty three moves around the world I've finally unpacked them in a library in the old Georgian house we've just restored. I love the research for each book, and they all have elements I most enjoy reading about myself - family secrets, epic love, real historical figures making cameos, beautiful houses, and amazing locations.\", \"Every book starts with a question, and writing the story is a way of answering that. Each story also has at its heart something I love, whether that's travel, art, photography or perfume. I've written about the girls who flew Spitfires, the little known 'artist's Schindler' in the south of France, and the women who fought and reported the Spanish Civil War. Historical fiction is like time travel and I love how it lets you see how people made sense of their lives in difficult times.\", \"Writing is part of life. I've always written with children and animals coming and going, and I like Stephen King's advice to put your desk in the corner of the room and just get on with it. I've never bought in to that old idea that the 'pram in the hall' is the enemy of writing. I've worked, and raised a family, and have just finished my ninth novel, spending the summer editing on Devon's Atlantic coast while my children surfed. Thanks to you all, nine books on I've gone from writing in a corridor to being an international bestseller, and I am really grateful for that.\", 'Writing is a conversation - when you finish writing a story it belongs to the reader. What I hope is that when you reach the last page you feel this is a beginning, not an end, that these characters will live on in your imagination and you might find yourself wondering what they are going to do next.', \"Now these stories are yours, and I'd love to hear what you think. You can find me on social media or at www.katelordbrown.com\", 'Happy reading -', 'Kate']}"
