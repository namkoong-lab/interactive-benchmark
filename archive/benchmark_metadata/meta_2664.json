        "Edward isn’t ready to swim without his water wings",
        "Edward Bear is all excited to go to Georgina’s birthday. It’s a pool party, and Edward wants to wear his water wings. But Edward is the only one wearing wings and some guests tease him about it. Edward isn’t quite ready for this kind of party. As we know, some of us need our water wings a bit longer than others. It’s fine to swim in water wings as long as you feel safe. This story in the Edward Almost Ready series is recommended for children ages two through six.  This fixed-layout ebook, which preserves the design and layout of the original print book, features read-along narration."
