        "Queen of Ice Frozen & Freaky: An Adult Fairy Tale (Book 2)14,000 wordsI ran, blowing across mountaintops like a blizzard’s gust. Finally free to live a life of my own choosing, I did all the naughty things I’d always dreamed of. A castle of ice leapt from my fingertips, and manly ice servants catered to my every need. There was nothing more a girl could want. Well...almost nothing. I wasn’t immune to loneliness, no matter what I told myself. I would’ve given anything to see my sister again.
