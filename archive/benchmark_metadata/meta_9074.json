        "A collection of Edward Colvers captivating photographic works. For over 25 years, Colver has been one of the main documentarians of the Southern California punk rock scene. This book serves both as catalog to Colvers retrospective show at the Grand Central Art Center Main Gallery at Cal State Fullerton, and as a testament to his impressive career. The exhibition runs from July 1 - August 20, 2006, yet this book is a timeless coffee table album on one of the 20th centurys most important underground photographers.",
