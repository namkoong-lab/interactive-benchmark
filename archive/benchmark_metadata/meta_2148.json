        "The concept of free markets is an illusion. Money flows not to the place of greatest value, but where those in power choose to send it. Your view of the stock market will never be the same.Jake Chamberlain knows he is right. It is just that nobody believes him. His research is thorough and the evidence is overwhelming. He knows he may have just discovered the most important finding in modern day finance. In doing so, it is a license to print money. Now he must decide whether or not to use it.Michelle Lancaster knows what she is doing is wrong, but she has no choice. Doing the wrong thing is sometimes the right for the common good. She has just been promoted to the most powerful non-elected position in the country. It is everything she has worked for, but the position comes with an added duty. This obligation is so secret that if it was revealed it could shake the foundation of the financial markets. Both will soon become the central figures in a global chase to get the upper hand, where one wrong choice may trigger the greatest financial collapse since the Great Depression.The Profit Dilemma is an intriguing, multilayered thriller about the inner workings of the stock market that is disturbingly plausible with significant global repercussions. It is a story that taps into recent headlines and news topics: big banks, insiders’ control, the manipulation of emotions, and the worldwide power struggle for influence on the financial world."
