        "Every LuK dual mass flywheel is 100% functionally tested to meet OEM performance specifications. These clutch replacement parts can be used for various models of Car, Truck, SUV & Van, Motorcycles & Scooters as well as ATVs & UTVs. LuK engineers have developed solid flywheel replacements for some OE dual-mass applications. \\n\\nResurfaced flywheels may be machined beyond their usable life - a critical flaw that would not be evident until after the clutch has been installed. Over-machining removes metal needed to absorb heat, impairing the flywheel’s heat sink capacity and shortening clutch service life. Improper machining can also cause interference, no release and slipping problems. LuK products are never resurfaced. The LuK (DMF042) dual-mass flywheel absorbs engine vibrations before they are transmitted to the driveline where they can rattle gears. It has a primary section that bolts to the crankshaft, and a secondary section, onto which the clutch is bolted. The primary section of the LuK DMF dampens, isolates engine vibrations and prevents engine torque spikes from damaging the transmission. By design, dual-mass flywheels cannot be resurfaced. Pairing your new LuK RepSet with a new LuK DMF is a smart, cost-effective alternative to resurfacing. Easy, one-step ordering ensures that you get the right components for your application and the right fit for hassle-free installation. Don’t take chances with questionable parts. Install a new, original-equipment quality LuK flywheel and maximize the performance and service life of your clutch. \\n\\nPremium grade materials are used for superior-quality friction surfaces, along with excellent heat-absorption capacity. This perfectly balanced OEM flywheel is backed by LuK and the industry’s most trusted warranty. Luk is voted the #1 recommended clutch brand by installers year after year. \\n\\nPlease check for the correct build, year and model before buying."
