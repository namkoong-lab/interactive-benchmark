        "In 1956, five young men traveled deep into the jungles of Ecuador to establish communication with the fierce and isolated Waorani tribe. In a nearby village, their wives huddled around a radio receiver, eagerly awaiting news of the historic encounter. The news they received sent shock waves around the world and changed their lives forever.",
