        "Here is the key to Portugal's loveliest places and friendliest people. From the Algarve to the Minho, we take you to manor houses, monasteries, old farms, hotels and simple retreats.Ancient granite, marble flagstones, blue-tile friezes, white-washed walls, Roman tiles and old-fashioned grandeur - they are all here in rich profusion. Laze under olive trees or on white sands, sip local wine and feast on fresh sardines grilled in the open air. You may never want to leave. Each entry has color photographs, regional maps, precise directions and much, much more. (5 X 8 1/2, 208 pages, color photos, maps, icons)"
