        "CornHollerTM will instantly bring life to your cornhole boards! When a sensor is triggered by a bag going into the hole the speaker \"HOLLER'S\" one of 7 short individual cheers! Some of the cheers are: \"Great shot\", \"3 points\", \"swish\", \"cha-ching\", \"it's in the hole\", crowd cheers and applause, etc... It takes 3 AA batteries (not included) and mounts to most wooden boards within minutes with 2 screws (provided).******************** It also has a small LED light wired to it in case the light conditions are not ideal under your board(all screws and clips to mount wire and light are included). If you do not have a wooden board this device may still be installed. Instead of attaching it with screws you may use poster tape, tape strips, or velcro. We have had success with all of these methods on different surfaces from plastic to faux wood."
