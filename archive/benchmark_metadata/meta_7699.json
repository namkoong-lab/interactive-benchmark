        ".",
        "Menley Nichols and her husband, Adam, a criminal attorney, rent a house on Cape Cod, in the hope of restoring their faltering marriage. The birth of their daughter, Hannah, has revitalized their relationship, but Menley has never stopped blaming herself for the accidental death of her two-year-old son. The serenity of the Cape promises a new start. But when they visit Remember House, an eighteenth-century landmark with a sinister past, strange incidents force Menley to relive the accident that killed her son, and she begins to fear for Hannah's safety. Then Adam takes on a client suspected of murder when his wealthy young bride of only three months drowns in a storm—and the family is drawn into a rising tide of terror. A confrontation on a dark, rain-swept beach leads to a harrowing climax that only Mary Higgins Clark could have created."

        "By 9 P.M. the storm had broken with full force, and a stiff wind was sendingpowerful waves crashing against the eastern shore of Cape Cod. We're going toget more than a touch of the nor'easter, Menley thought as she reached over thesink to close the window. It might actually be fun, she thought, in an effortto reassure herself. The Cape airports were closed, so Adam had rented a car todrive from Boston. He should be home soon. There was plenty of food on hand. Shehad stocked up on candles, just in case the electricity went out, although ifshe was right about what she was beginning to suspect, the thought of being inthis house with only candlelight was frightening.",
        "She switched on the radio, twisted the dial and found the Chatham stationthat played forties music. She raised an eyebrow in surprise as the BennyGoodman orchestra went into the opening notes of \"Remember.\"",
        "A particularly appropriate song when you're living in a place calledRemember House, she thought. Pushing aside the inclination to flip the dialagain, she picked up a serrated knife and began to slice tomatoes for a salad.When he phoned, Adam told her he hadn't had time to eat. \"But you forgot toremember,\" the vocalist warbled.",
        "The unique sound that the wind made when it rushed past the house wasstarting again. Perched high on the embankment over the churning water, thehouse became a kind of bellows in a wind storm, and the whooshing sound itemitted had the effect of a distant voice calling out \"Remember, Remember...\"The legend was that over the decades that peculiarity had given the house itsname.",
        "Menley shivered as she reached for the celery. Adam will be here soon, shepromised herself. He'd have a glass of wine while she made some pasta.",
        "There was a sudden noise. What was that? Had a door blown open? Or a window?Something was wrong.",
        "She snapped off the radio. The baby! Was she crying? Was that a cry or amuffed, gagging sound? Menley hurried to the counter, grabbed the monitor andheld it to her ear. Another choking gasp and then nothing. The baby was choking!",
        "She rushed from the kitchen into the foyer, toward the staircase. Thedelicate fan-shaped window over the front door sent gray and purple shadowsalong the wide-plank floor.",
        "Her feet barely touched the stairs as she raced to the second floor and downthe hall. An instant later she was at the door of the nursery. There was nosound coming from the crib. \"Hannah, Hannah,\" she cried.",
        "Hannah was lying on her stomach, her arms outstretched, her bodymotionless. Frantically, Menley leaned down, turning the baby as she picked herup. Then her eyes widened in horror.",
        "The china head of an antique doll rested against her hand. A painted facestared back at her.",
        "Menley tried to scream, but no sound came from her lips. And then frombehind her a voice whispered,",
        "\"I'm sorry, Menley. It's all over.\"",
