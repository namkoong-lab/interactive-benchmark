        "Finally a book on natural hair are that works!",
        "This book provides the best, no nonsense information on caring for long hair that I've found. No expensive, chemical filled bandaid solutions here. Just the suggestion to rinse my hair with cool water alone has diminished the frizziness. It lays the cuticle down after washing hair in warm water. The recipes for hot oil treatments and masks consist of ingredients I already have: avocados, olive and coconut oils, bananas, etc. Apple cider vinegar as a rinse to eliminate hair product buildup before a normal shampoo. If you love your long hair and care about your health, give this book a try.",

        "From the Inside Flap",
        "Introduction",
        "For the majority of people pampering your hair with homemade shampoos and masks is more time consuming and complicated than using commercial ones. That's why a lot of women don't even try to replace the products they are used to with something they don't know the effects of. Even when they know that shampoos and hair masks are full of harmful chemistry, women still use them because they feel there is no alternative at all. For many years I too had stopped using homemade hair masks because I either didn't have the time or the will to replace old habits and try something new. Only recently have I started again really thinking what substances I surround myself and my family with, and started eliminating one by one every potentially harmful product in my house. Without being a fanatic, I try to use more natural products in every aspect of our life. That's how I rediscovered homemade hair masks. That, and the fact that I decided to grow long hair again. So after more than a year, I can say that to have and to maintain beautiful, thick and shiny hair is a lot easier than I had initially thought, and it is also very rewarding. Every woman feels good and happy when she has beautiful hair and the experience of preparing a hair mask at home is actually very exciting and pleasant when you know you are doing it for yourself. You just have to experiment to find out what mask works best for your hair. Try different combinations of ingredients which you think might work for your hair type; adjust the length of time you leave the mask on your hair, and the quantities of each ingredient in the mixture you use. Everybody's hair is different, so your ideal recipe will be unique too. For me, it seems bananas do miracles especially when combined with oatmeal and a little apple cider vinegar. But I am still experimenting and feeding my hair with different masks because it is fun and, if the mask doesn't seem to be the right one, it is no big deal - next time I make something different.Just remember that healthy hair comes only when we take care of our overall health. There are major steps everyone can follow in order to have healthy, thick and long hair and the most important ones are following a healthy diet with lots of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and proteins, doing enough physical exercise, and, last but not least, getting enough sleep and relaxation.",
