From there it was only a small step to deciding to become a writer. Of course, deciding and becoming are two different things, as she soon discovered. Fortunately for the world, her first attempts at fiction, which included a play for her fifth grade class entitled \"All About Thermometers,\" were not published, but she did meet her goal of selling a novel by her thirtieth birthday. Since then she\\'s sold more than forty novels. When she\\'s not writing, Amanda enjoys sewing, cooking and - of course - reading.']}"
