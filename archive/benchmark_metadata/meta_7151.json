        "Review",
        "\"This is an ideal textbook for a business calculus class, especially one that serves students interested in economics or finance and thus is not a terminal course in mathematics. More than with any other text I use, I find myself referring students to examples or supplemental sections in the textbook to answer their questions.\"\"The real applications presented in this book really make it shine. Waner and Costenoble do a phenomenal job of grounding calculus in the day-to-day world of a student. It's obvious that a lot of work has been done researching genuine applications.\"\"I'd describe it as 'student friendly' and easy to read. The book is also current on the issues and applications with excellent technology resources.\"",
        "About the Author",
        "Stefan Waner and Steven R. Costenoble both received their Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, having studied several years apart with the same advisor, J. Peter May. Their paths merged when Steven joined Stefan at Hofstra University in 1987; since then they have coauthored 18 research papers as well as a research-level monograph in algebraic topology. By the early 1990s they had become dissatisfied with many of the Finite Mathematics and Applied Calculus textbooks. They wanted textbooks that were more readable and relevant to students' interests, containing examples and exercises that were interesting, and reflected the interactive approaches and techniques they found worked well with their own students. It therefore seemed natural to extend their research collaboration to a joint textbook writing project that expressed these ideals. To this day, they continue to work together on their textbook projects, their research in algebraic topology, and their teaching."
