        "Review",
        "The Shadowbearer is just as full of epic battles, evil nemesis, andtwisted plottings that were in Etchings of Power. I should also mentionthat the 'magic' system used in the books is well-thought out and veryunique. This is a series I'll enjoy keeping up with. Jackie M. mytowerofbooks.blogspot.com/Terry Simpson has written a high paced fantasy with all the twists andturns that keep the reader on the edge of their seat. His story isbrilliantly brought to life with vivid descriptions of a world wherepeople have supernatural abilities and use those abilities in thrillingbattle scenes. AnnThis puts hero back int heroic fantasy. Stefan Dorn's struggles betweenhis vow and what is right make for a very entertaining read. It alsogives a lot of insight into Mr. Simpson's world. Very enjoyable and hard to put down. Gerald Black, Author of Sentient Sword",

        "The Shadowbearer brings to life the events, history, and some motivations behind much of the world in Aegis of the Gods. It was something I endeavored to write to give my reader an insight into the mind of one of the heroes in Etchings of Power who did not have a story arc.",
