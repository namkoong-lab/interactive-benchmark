        "This is German DJ and producer Gregor Tresher's third release for the Datapunk label. Tresher has rendered outstanding electro services with his project Sniper Mode, modernizing the formal style of electro. His two albums Wastelands (2002) and Travellers Beyond (2003) supplied the blueprint for the musical orientation of the Elektrolux sub-label, Mikrolux. Tresher is considered to be the hottest newcomer of the past year, in part due to the Still EP (2005) and the \"Komm\" remix of the Väth/Rother contribution to the Cocoon Compilation E - Tresher achieved two tracks which received a place of honour in Sven Väth's DJ box and were included in his successful compilation, the Sound of the Sixth Season. Tresher has rocked the best clubs in all of Europe in the past year, from London to Budapest, from Madrid to Athens, from Marseilles to Berlin. For this reason, Tresher selected for Neon - Works in the Mix, two independent formats which present both his role as producer as well as DJ equally. As Tresher says, \"The freedom to be able to use elements like vocals or melodies has exquisitely expanded the spectrum of electronic dance music. For me, therefore, elektro has... a fully new meaning and is no longer defined by 808 beats or vocoder vocals but rather stands for style-spanning and energetic electronic music, free of conventions and rules and expandable in every direction.\" Whereas the four exclusive new titles are found in unmixed form on the double 12\", the CD edition presents these tracks with Tresher's entire Datapunk back catalog as a perfect DJ mix and thus really makes Tresher's musical development clear. From \"Firebutton\"'s classic vocoder-electro to the saw tooth attacks of \"Doom\" and \"On\" to \"Still\"'s Rhine-Main early '90s flavor, Datapunk predicts an excellent positioning for Tresher in all relevant annual charts for 2006."
