        "Set of 2 Wonderlicious Bibs bring cuteness to the table at meal time. One bib is appliqued, other bib has coordinating print. Bibs have Velcro closure and terry lining, one size fits 0-6 months. Machine wash cold on gentle cycle, air dry. In 1933, Mary Meyer started sewing unique companions for her children and neighbors. To this day, here in the hills of Vermont, Mary's grandchildren and great-grandchildren continue that same tradition of building care and comfort into everything they create. Whether it's picking out the perfect gift for a loved one, receiving a toy friend that will become a best buddy, or cuddling up with and enjoying the luxurious, premium fabrics of our soft toys, when it comes to Mary Meyer, it's love you can feel."
