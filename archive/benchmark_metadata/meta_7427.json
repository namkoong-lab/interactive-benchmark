        "Review",
        "Old Testament character studies frequently suffer from either hagiography and moralism or abstract theologizing which leaves real application disturbingly out of reach. In keeping with the goals of this series, this worthy study of Genesis 37-50 avoids both extremes. Sweetly blending exegetical care, Christ-centered insight and penetrating pastoral wisdom, the authors proffer a relevant and rich journey into gospel hope by their biblically sensitive treatment of the life of Joseph the son of Jacob. Readable and engaging, Living in the Light of Inextinguishable Hope delivers a rewarding look into God’s work in Joseph’s life, provides a window into God’s work in our own, and all the while drives us to the epicenter of Scripture: our redemption in Jesus Christ the Son of God. -- David B. Garner, Associate Professor of Systematic Theology, Westminster Theological SeminaryA beloved son suffers, is exalted, and thereby saves God’s guilty people from the death they deserve. If that scenario sounds familiar, it should: it is “the gospel according to Joseph.” Living in the Light of Inextinguishable Hope is the perfect sequel to Iain Duguid’s explorations of the gospel according to Abraham (Living in the Gap between Promise and Reality) and according to Isaac and Jacob (Living in the Grip of Relentless Grace). In each chapter Duguid and his pastoral colleague Matt Harmon lead us from the study―with strategic insights into each text’s original language, literary artistry, cultural context, and interpersonal dynamics―through the pulpit―with vivid articulation and conscience-searching application to our crooked hearts and broken relationships―to Jesus, whose undeserved suffering on the cross rescues us from destruction, melts our pride, and reconciles the most dysfunctional of families. -- Dennis E. Johnson, Ph.D., Professor of Practical Theology, Westminster Seminary California",
