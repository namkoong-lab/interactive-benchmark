        "Frank Stark has many demons, all of whom are fraying his sanity one day at a time. This dark and twisted psychological thriller delves into his mania. A horror narrative lending the reader a rare, macabre glimpse, if they dare to read.",
        "Excerpt: \"The birds no longer whistle. Love equates hate. My dreams are all nightmares. The sky is no longer blue. If there’s no other side, then to sleep forever will be better than to stay awake for one more minute in this life. I am the Alpha and Omega.\"",
        "Stark documents his daily activities in this macabre memoir, unveiling the incomprehensible inner workings of a psychotic mind. The average, rough-and-tumble sergeant from Rochester, New York seems to be in control during the day, but as night arrives he spirals deeper into an abyss. His voices had been quelled for years until he encountered a transient at the local pub. The series of events that followed reignited his passion to kill, preying on anyone within his reach."

        "From the Author",
        "Hi. Thank you for your interest in",
        "Stained Mirror, A Serial Killer Memoir",
        ". I began the novel in 2017, completing it in 2021. The setting is Rochester, NY where I lived for most of my life. Studying the psyche of many serial killers through documentaries and books brought this character to another level, a real one. What I learned is their portrayal on television shows and movies are grossly inaccurate. They are no different than you or I, except for the obvious. Frank Stark is that normal person who struggles with many issues. His darkness took a toll on me since I lived through his actions. I don't regret it and will certainly do it again. The book, although not noted on the description page, is part of a series which seeks to explore the making of a serial killer. I intend writing about his childhood as well as a sequel and interlude.",
        "About the Author",
        "Thank you for reading. I am flattered as well as grateful. This will not be the \"typical\" about-the-author page.I've been writing since I was a child, and remember it as if it was yesterday, even though those days are far removed. I grew up and lived in Rochester, NY for over forty years, then moved to the Cape Coral / Fort Myers, FL area. I love animals more than humans because they aren't judgmental and know what they want. That being said, I support all humans who promote love, equality, and acceptance. I am vocal about the aforementioned and have been since I was five. The best analogy to my prior statements about love is when you nuzzle a kitten, puppy, or newborn. That exact moment is nirvana.On writing: I hope to have additional novels out soon. They will not be limited to any genre.If you liked Stained Mirror, or have other questions, etc..., please feel free to contact me."
