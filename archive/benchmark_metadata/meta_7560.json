        "Can a chicken and a cat be friends? Illustrated by local children, Pixie and Fenway Unlikely Friends at Two Mountain Farm tells a true story of friendship between a chicken that was the victim of the pecking order and a house cat. With the underlying lesson of tolerance and accepting differences in others, this is a wonderful story for non-readers, young readers, and big kids alike. You never know where you may find a great friend."
