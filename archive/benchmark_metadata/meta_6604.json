        "Sweetgrass baskets are a significant part of South Carolina history and heritage. These baskets are handcrafted daily, and the craft has been handed down from generation to generation. This craft was brought over to the US by African slaves from the West Coast of Africa in the late 17th century. This craft is still practice today in the Lowcountry SC, mainly the Charleston area. SWEETGRASS BANGLE BRACELETS The sweetgrass bangle bracelets are handmade in three styles: sweetgrass, long leaf pine needle, or mixture of both materials. These bangles are great accessories to add to any outfit and can be worn during an occassion. You can order theses bangles as a set of five or just a single bangle. You have several options to order a combination of these bangles which include both materials. If you order a combination set, please indicate how many of each style (sweetgrass or pine needle) that you would like for your set. For example, if you want to order a combination of four bangles, then you would have the following options: 1 pine and 3 sweetgrass, 1 sweetgrass and 3 pine, or 2 sweetgrass and 2 pine.
