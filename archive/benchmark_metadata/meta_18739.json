        "Skin Apothetique is a line of nourishing personal care products created in the spirit of honoring past traditions of beauty and well-being. Rather than jumping on the latest beauty trends, we at Skin believe in building on the wisdom handed down from past generations. We try to honor this lore by hand-mixing luxurious formulas using only high-quality ingredients. Our pantry of natural herbs, fruit, honey and oils enable us to create products that soothe the body and the senses. Started 30 years ago by Candace Goldflies and called Skin, An Apothecary in Vail, Colorado. Candace, who had always been interested in the beauty industry, combined her love of nature and tradition when creating her hand-made personal care products. She opened a second boutique in Aspen. Sadly, in the midst of her success, Candace became ill and after a long struggle lost her fight to cancer. Enter Iris Goldflies, Candace's niece. Iris, who had spent summers working with her aunt, moved to Vail after college to help her with the business fulltime. Iris became the natural choice to take over her aunt's life work. Her family moved the line from the mountains to Ohio where the rest of the family was from. For over thirty years, they have been honing her craft by producing some of the best personal care products available. Skin Apothetique is one of today’s best-kept beauty secrets."
