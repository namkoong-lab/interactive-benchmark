        "In April of 1988, Donald McCaig traveled to Scotland to buy a young, well-bred female sheepdog to raise and train for use on his three-hundred-acre Virginia farm. He knew exactly what he wanted: a Scottish border collie, considered the best sheepdog in the world because the breed is hardworking, smart, strong, and fast, with unique personalities. McCaig attends dog trials and meets numerous trainers, fellow shepherds, and top handlers before he finally finds Gael. From his heartfelt prayers that Gael will pass her eye exam to his faithful sheepdog Pip’s reaction to the new bitch on the farm,",

        "chronicles McCaig’s journey through the Scottish highlands, where border collies have been bred since the seventeenth century, and illuminates the ennobling bond between humans and dogs. This ebook contains sixteen pages of photos."

        "Billed as a nonfiction sequel to the author's best-selling Nop's Trials ( LJ 4/1/84), this book details McCaig's stay in Scotland to attend sheep dog trials and meet breeders and handlers. The central theme evolves around his search for a trained border collie to bring back to his Virginia home. About three quarters through the book, McCaig finds his dog (Gael)--and then almost never mentions her again. Instead, he lapses into telling of another trip to see more Scottish trials and handlers. McCaig is a good writer, whose plain, friendly style appeals to those who enjoy dog stories, but neglecting to develop his story about Gael in her new home and her success or failure in American trials will limit the book's appeal to those seriously interested in sporting dog events. Casual readers will probably lose interest.",
