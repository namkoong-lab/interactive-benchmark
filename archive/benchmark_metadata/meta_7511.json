        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 9 Up—Kalah is lucky to have best friends like Brit and Beth. Seniors and cocaptains of the field hockey team, Brit and Beth took Kalah in when she transferred to Northside, introducing her to their world of high school popularity and drama. But Kalah is falling for Beth, and before she can talk to her about her feelings, Beth vanishes. According to rumors, her disappearance is tied to a secret relationship with Brit's boyfriend, and soon after the gossip begins, Brit commits suicide, leaving Kalah without either of her two friends. Following Brit's death, Beth finally contacts Kalah, but when she does, Kalah realizes that something is very wrong. This novel tackles themes of friendship, deception, obsession, and love. However, Kalah encounters the same set of problems and reacts the same way over and over again, coming across as a bit static and at times tiresome. The pace picks up about two-thirds of the way through, which brings about a welcome change in Kalah, although the secondary characters remain underdeveloped. VERDICT With early hints of John Green's Paper Towns (Dutton, 2008) that slowly morph into Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl (Crown, 2012), this work is recommended for dedicated readers of realistic fiction.—Maggie Mason Smith, Clemson University R. M. Cooper Library, South Carolina",
