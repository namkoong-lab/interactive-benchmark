        "Now in one of the most popular sizes, we have brought a flashing led. The 5mm flashing round top yellow/gold led will automatically start flashing once it is appropriately hooked up to power. There is nothing extra needed when hooking this led up to power. A power source, led, and resistor is all you need. 2hz = 2 cycles per second or about 120 times per minute. It will flash on and off 2 times each approximately per second. We consider this a â€œfastâ€? flashing LED. The frequency is approximate.We use and have only the highest quality leds out there."
