        "About the Author",
        "Bryan Zimmerman is a life long entrepreneur who from his early childhood has constantly tested the boundaries of conformity. Always seeking a way to forge his own path and never accepting what is merely presented, he has achieved great success in multiple industries. With his blue collar background, the thing he prides himself most on is meeting and talking with people. \"I'm as laid back as they come\" he says, \"I still prefer a handshake and a conversation over sending emails\". Having run a construction company for almost 10 years, Bryan brought his brick and mortar business values to his internet businesses and achieved success very quickly. With his current company having processed over $70 Million dollars, Bryan is in high demand for consulting as well as speaking engagements. Refusing to conform to what society deems a successful person should look like, what he enjoys most is blending in and meeting new people."
