        "This stylish novelty keyring is ornamented with an elegant mother of pearl apricot flower and bird design. One of the sagunja (\"four noble beings\") motifs loved by Korean artists, maehwa refers to the Korean apricot blossom that has long been the herald of spring. Korean artists have been fascinated by maehwa, which blooms at the end of winter, and thus have praised it as a symbol of the noble spirit overcoming all hardships. The arrangement of intricate design's iridescence and color of mother of pearl makes it an impressive item for collection."
