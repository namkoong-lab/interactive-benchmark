        "From the Manufacturer",
        "If you can't reach the plug with what's in your tool chest you can't get the job done. SK spark plug sockets are available in two drive sizes and a variety of styles to ensure that you have the right tool for all of your needs. The universal configuration allows you to more easily service spark plugs in hard-to-reach or restricted work areas. Our innovative swivel socket designs give you the access you need to complete every job with confidence. And a durable rubber retainer holds spark plugs by the porcelain insulator for better grip. 100% Made in the U.S.A. featuring SK's high polish SuperKrome® finish which protects the tools from the harsh working environments found in today's workplace. All sockets feature SK's SureGrip® hex design which drives the side of the fastener not the corner to avoid edge breakage which can occur on rusted or damaged fasteners when a traditional straight cornered hex tool is used."
