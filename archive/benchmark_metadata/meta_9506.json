        "Peter Blood, a physician and English gentleman, turned pirate out of a rankling sense of injustice. Barely escaping the gallows after his arrest for treating wounded rebels, Blood is enslaved on a Barbados plantation. When he escapes, no ship sailing the Spanish Main is safe from Blood and his men.  This classic adventure is alive with color, romance, and excitement and smoothly comments on the social injustices of slavery, the dangers of intolerance, the power of love, the role of fate, and the ways oppression can drive good men to desperate measures.  Introduction by Gary Hoppenstand"
