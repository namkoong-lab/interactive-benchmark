        "Writing First with Readings: Practice in Context",
        ", designed for the paragraph to essay course, Kirszner and Mandell take seriously the ideas and expressive abilities of developmental students, as well as their need to learn the rules of writing and grammar. Visual writing prompts that open every chapter get students writing immediately. By moving frequently between their own writing, writing models and instruction, and workbook-style mastery exercises, students get constant reinforcement of the skills they are learning. Thoughtful chapters on college success, research, and critical reading, along with high-interest essays, round out the text, making it the perfect introduction to college writing.",
