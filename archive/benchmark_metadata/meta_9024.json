        "The Corvette is in a league of its own. As the all-American V-8 sports car, no other high-performance American car can match it for enthusiast interest, collectability, and in many cases, performance. GM has cranked out model after memorable model continuously from 1953 to present, with the only exception being 1983. During this time, the Corvette earned a fanatical following and iconic status. Over the course of 14-year production run of the third generation, more than a half-million Corvettes were built.",
        "Many Corvettes have been driven aggressively during their lifetime while others have not been properly stored nor maintained. Whether it's hard use, neglect or just elapsed time, often these 30-years-old or older cars require a major restoration and not just simple repair. Through the pages of this book, you are expertly guided through each crucial stage of the restoration process from disassembly to inspection and parts selection to assembly. The hands-on restoration techniques for all major component groups are explained in exceptional detail for professional results, including suspension, engine, interior, body, paint, brakes, steering, electrical, and interior. Special coverage is devoted to restoring the birdcage frame and the fiberglass body. These restoration procedures are explained with extensive step-by-step captions and brilliant full-color photos so you confidently complete each step and ultimately the restoration of an entire car. In addition, the author addresses the real-world benefits and drawbacks of doing the work yourself. In addition, it will contain essential model information, VIN identification, powertrain and interior options and more. If you’ve been looking for the authoritative guide for restoring your 1968-1982 Stingray, then you’ve found it.",
        "There has been and will be a strong and flourishing restoration industry for the third-generation Corvette. Whether you're an informed owner or skilled enthusiast, this book will provide an essential information source for those who want to restore this affordable Corvette model at home."

        "From the Back Cover",
        "Unmistakable and alluring style, excellent handling, and enormous performance from big-block power. The Corvette C3, built from 1968 to 1982, was the longest running and top selling Corvette generation in history. This iconic Stingray model, firmly ingrained in automotive consciousness, influenced the American automotive design, and for many enthusiasts became the quintessential Corvette. The 1968–1974 Corvettes were equipped with spirited small-blocks as well as high-horsepower, big-block V-8s. While these early cars bring top dollar at auction, Corvettes built from 1975 to 1982 (with a few exceptions) are plentiful, affordable, and can be upgraded to high-performance cars.",
