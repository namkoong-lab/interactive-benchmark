        "This story has the same panty-dropping sex appeal that Warren is know for writing/mastering, but don't get it twisted. Ride isn't just about hot sex (though there is plenty of that). It's a heart-string-tugging love story, through and through.\"",

        "\"",
        "I like that Rie Warren dealt with a pretty tough real life issue in a delicate but real way. And I just LOVE Jase - a dirty mouthed bad-ass with a gentle side. Makes me smile just to write that. I am grabbing up the rest in this series right now!\"",
