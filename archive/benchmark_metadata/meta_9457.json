        "For the late psychic Edgar Cayce, the aura provided a pictorial representation of an individual s health, thoughts, talents, and life potentials as well as karmic lessons and even past lives. In a very real sense, the aura functions as a barometer of the whole self body, mind, and spirit. Psychic Carol Ann Liaros and Cayce expert Kevin J. Todeschi have joined together to present a unique volume that teaches you to access your intuitive self in order to see these auras and colors and then goes on to explain their mean-ing as based on the well-documented readings of Edgar Cayce. Their work explores colors and the human aura in a way that provides practical tools for understanding that can be applied in your own life right now."
