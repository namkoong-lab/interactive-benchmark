        "The Fifth Gospel presents some compelling new evidence about the life of Jesus which has been derived from a variety of sources in the East which are unknown to most Western scholars. By chance, one of the authors found, in 1965, a reference in Ladakh to the discovery of Buddhist scrolls about Jesus. Since then, the authors have been examining evidence about the survival of Jesus Christ at the time of the crucifixion, and his subsequent travels to the East. The authors' main purpose in writing this book is to inform the West that \"we in the East have some source material about the historical Jesus who lived on after the crucifixion.... This book was not written in one day, but is a result of many years' continued search for evidence,\" and provides research on some very compelling questions, such as: Did God descend on this earth as Jesus? Did Jesus visit India at age 13? Did Jesus survive his crucifixion? Was Jesus saved by his Essene friends, then traveled to the East, visiting many countries, finally settling in Kashmir? Jesus has been mentioned in Oriental manuscripts by many names: Issa, Isa, Issana-deva, Isha Natha, Ishai, Isa Masih, Yusu, Yuzu, Yuzu-Kristo, Yuz-Asaph, and Yusu Masih. In some works, he is mentioned as Eshvara-putram, or the Son of God, and Kanaya-garbum or Born of a Girl. In some ancient manuscripts he is called Metteyya, which is equivalent to Messiah. In some Persian works, he is known as Nasrani or Kristani, which is equivalent to \"of Nazareth\" or Christian. It is also interesting that the Christians are known in the East as Nasaran and Kira. Jesus is also titled in the East as Ibn-i-Maryam or the Son of Mary. Whether Jesus Christ did or did not die on the cross, or passed away naturally at an older age, like the Buddha, is a vital question in which not only Christians but others are keenly interested. For example, this book presents startling evidence about the tomb of Jesus or Yuzu-Asaph in Kashmir. The research will remain incomplete until this tomb is opened for investigation."
