        "“Grace and truth came [or subsists] through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17b ASV, and Darby in brackets). The Greek word for “came” is ginomai which means “has come”—signifying that that which before had never actually been in being in the world now begins to be so. In other words, grace actually commenced to be, yet not in God’s mind, of course, but in revelation and actual existence down here on the earth (see Darby’s footnote discussion on “subsists” in John 1:17). Mankind could not fully understand what divine grace is till it was revealed in Jesus Christ; nor could believing mankind fully apprehend the depth of that grace till it be found in Christ Jesus. Even today this so great salvation continually amazes those of us who have been touched by God’s grace.In August 1937 brother Watchman Nee gave a series of ten messages in Singapore on the Biblical theme of Amazing Grace. They were greatly appreciated at that time by those who heard. Now for the first time they have been translated into English for the benefit of the English-speaking world. May God use these messages to strengthen our faith."

Having already borne two daughters, she prayed that if God should give her a son, she would give him back to God. As the boy grew up, he showed every sign of promise except he had no interest in things spiritual. It was not till he was seventeen years of age that he was met by the Lord. He knew at that time that he must accept Christ Jesus as his Savior, yet he struggled over the necessity of surrendering his life to the Lord. The love of Christ finally overwhelmed him and he capitulated to Christ. This was on April 29, 1920. He had such a love for the Word of God that he studied it almost incessantly, so within a very short period he had read the whole Bible several times. He began to witness for Christ to his school mates and soon earned the nickname of \"the preacher\". In searching the Scripture, he (with a few other believers) discovered \\'the simplicity and purity that is towards Christ.\\' He determined to follow the Word of God explicitly and nothing but the Word.', 'In 1927 he began his life work in Shanghai, where he was able to practice the vision which the Lord had shown him in the Word. He understood that the eternal purpose of God is Christ and His Church. Through the mighty working of the Holy Spirit and the faithful ministry of this servant of God, this testimony spread over the vast land of China.', 'In 1949 the Communists took over China. Knowing what would be waiting for him back home, he nonetheless felt strongly his responsibility toward God and His Church. So he returned to China from Hong Kong in 1950. In April of 1952 he was seized and put in prison. He was later falsely accused as a master spy and was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment. In prison he was not allowed to do anything but what was assigned him by prison authority. At the expiration of his sentence term, he was not released, and the news arrived quickly that he died faithful to the Lord.']}"
