        "A collection of ten short stories to unsettle, disturb, chill or terrify. From the creeping unease of The Moth's Kiss of the title to the eeriness of A Fragrance of Roses, the stories seep into the consciousness of the reader. Shivers down the spine and a need to check doors and windows are a probable outcome of reading this collection alone at night. You'll never look at willows or mosquitoes the same. Or moths."

        "My Twitter bio said writer, poet, explorer and mystic and that probably says it all quite neatly. I've written stories my whole life, even before I could actually read. My father mistakenly allowed me to use his typewriter from an early age and I was hooked. I'm not sure the typewriter survived very long having me bash out strings of letters in the belief that what I had in my head would magically transform into words others can read. I've got better at that. I write novels, short stories and poetry, and I also blog at http://zenandtheartoftightropewalking.wordpress.com",
