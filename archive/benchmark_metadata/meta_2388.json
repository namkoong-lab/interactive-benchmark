One that I could not put down until I finished it. It will stay with you long after you have finished. You will fall in love with Lily. She is not one to let things drop just because some don't want to talk about it. She wants answers and intends to have them....\"  - Ismore43\"Once again Susan Gabriel writes the kind of story that won't release you and invites you to return time and time again like an old friend.

To finally see how the characters evolved and always feeling like I was right there in the cabin on Katy's Ridge. Well done!\" - Kimberly Goodwin\"Couldn't wait for Lily's Song (sequel to",
