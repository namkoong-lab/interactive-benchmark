        "Suspense with a love story . . . After she’s dumped by her faithless fiancé, Claire Spencer abandons her dreams of a family of her own. Instead, she plots her solo course and settles for a quiet life as an independent Williamsburg shop owner. So how does she become a killer’s target? Sometime security consultant Riley, burned out, stung by his ex-wife, and haunted by a young girl he couldn’t save, vows never to work with women again. But when a thug tries to kill Claire and she winds up in Riley’s arms, his plans go all to hell. Knowing she’s in danger, he can't walk away.Old letters in a hidden trunk reveal long-buried secrets, leading Claire and Riley to political connections with organized crime and Mob hitmen. While dodging a speeding car, ducking bullets, and escaping through murky swamp waters, conventional Claire and freewheeling Riley struggle against their powerful chemistry—if she’s picket fences, he’s barbed wire. Opposites do attract.August 7, 2015: Epilogue added this date. The first edition of this book was published by Echelon Press. Same book, new cover."

        "\"Realistic and frightening suspense, enough romance to satisfy anyone, and a very satisfying end.\" RP Dahlke \"full of suspense and romance. I had a hard time putting it down.\" Jacqui \"This author does a fabulous job with dialogue, story line, character development, and the rate at which the story moved. Not one boring moment!\"  Tele's mom\"Love the plot...it started with action and mystery with a damsel in distress. Enter our hero, a rough around the edges knight in a not so shiny armor, only to realize that said damsel in distress is not what he expected.\" March G (Audio review) \"This excellent, riveting story was difficult to stop listening to. I ended up  staying up all night because of it.\" Kindle Customer \"A top notch thriller without all the gore.\" Mb4pax \"A nice balance of mystery and romance. The writing is graceful, the characters are real.\" Barbara J. Williams",

        "About the Author",
        "Ellis writes the stories she likes to read--action, adventure, and heart. She falls in love with the characters, flawed but striving to do the right thing, and hates leaving them when the book is finished. Her novels are suspense stories with varying degrees of romance. All contain mild adult language and situations.  She writes two series of linked books: the McGuire women books feature members of a family with a psychic streak; and the Maleantes & More books, though standalone stories, are linked by the major characters, who work for Will Porter, head of Maleantes & More Security Consultants. Her short stories are Southern fiction, quite different from her novels. Ellis lives in the beautiful South Carolina Piedmont with her husband, a wonderful rescue dog, and assorted creatures who  wander by for a meal. facebook.com/EllisVidler.AuthorPage",
