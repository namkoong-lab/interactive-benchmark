        "In Sunlight, in a Beautiful Garden",
        "tells of a bittersweet romance set against the backdrop of the greatest industrial disaster in American history: the construction and subsequent collapse in 1889 of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, dam. It was a tragedy that cost 2,200 lives, implicated some of the most illustrious financiers of the day-Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Mellon-whose carelessness contributed to the disaster, and irreparably changed the lives of those who survived it.This is the story of these men and of the families who lived in the shadow of the dam: the daughter of the lawyer who filed the charter for an exclusive club on the shore of the artificially created lake; the Quaker steel mill owner who tried to stop the dam's construction; a librarian, escaping to a bustling mountain city from a loveless life in Boston; a young man determined to expose and undermine the greed and carelessness that shaped the last years of the nineteenth century. A cautionary tale for our new century, In Sunlight, in a Beautiful Garden is a story of youthful promise and devastating loss, of power and its misuse, and of greed and the philanthropy that is too often a guilty by-product of it."

        "Amazon.com Review",
        "From the very start, we know that many of the characters in Kathleen Cambor's haunting first novel will die before it's over. This lends a sepia-toned dignity to what is already a fairly somber tale.",
        "In Sunlight, in a Beautiful Garden",
        "tells the story of the Johnstown flood of 1889, in which over 2,000 people--mostly working folk, who had no say in the erection of the ill-considered South Fork dam--lost their lives. The author has enlisted a large cast, including real-life plutocrats Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie. But her focus remains on such fictional characters as Frank Fallon, a Civil War veteran enjoying a brief, platonic affair with the town librarian; his son Daniel, a labor organizer; and Nora Talbot, the science-minded daughter of a middle-class lawyer who comes to believe that the dam, built to create an upper-crust aquatic playground, is in danger of flooding the town below.",
        "Cambor excels at depicting both the minor joys and the major tragedies in her characters' lives. Frank Fallon and his wife Julia, for example, have lost both of their children to diphtheria:",
        "It meant something to Julia to be the one to wash the bodies before the undertaker came. To leave Caroline's sickbed long enough to tend to her two younger children. To fill the basin with water warmed by the wood stove, to smooth the hair, to touch and trace their flesh one last time, memorizing them again, as she had right after she had birthed them. Touching toes, chin, the curled cusp of ear, the rounded mound of cheek, the dips and promontories of their supple spines. Frank couldn't bring himself to watch.",
        "Devotees of the historical novel will warm to Cambor's judicious use of period detail and her exacting prose, but may wish she had placed less emphasis on foreshadowing. We are told one too many times that the privileged men who built the dam had no interest in its structure or safety: \"Someone should have been watching.\" On the other hand, Cambor has the good narrative sense to confine the flood itself and its horrific aftermath to the final pages of the book. There we are also given a glimpse of Nora Talbot in later life, marked by her youthful love affair with Daniel and by the waters that were--in every sense of the phrase--to part them.",

        "Cambor (The Book of Mercy) deserves a wide readership for her second novel, set against the backdrop of the Johnstown, Pa., flood of 1889. The South Fork Dam separates two very different worlds: above it lies the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, whose members include captains of industry like Henry Frick and Andrew Mellon; below it are scattered several working-class towns. When James Talbot, a lawyer hired to secure the club's charter, alerts the members to the earthen dam's structural problems, his warnings go unheeded. Talbot, haunted by his failure to serve in the Civil War, determines to assuage his guilt by keeping watch over the dam and its constant repairs, but the wealthy club members have no interest in the families living below South Fork. Cambor creates a fully imagined cast: Frank Fallon, a steel mill foreman and Civil War veteran; his wife, Julia, who lost two of her four children in the 1879 diphtheria epidemic; and their surviving son, 23-year-old Daniel, who studies Greek with Grace McIntyre, a librarian from Boston who has secrets of her own. Daniel falls in love with James Talbot's daughter, Nora, a budding naturalist and scholar who holds herself separate from the South Fork club members. Cambor has a gift for imparting much factual information lyrically and thrillingly: the process of manufacturing steel rods is rendered as beautifully as Nora's sexual awakening. Diamond sharp, deep and passionate, this is an accomplished, moving work. Agent, Heather Schroeder. (Jan.) Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "From School Library Journal",
        "Adult/High School-Originally, the South Fork dam held water for the use of the railroad, but eventually a land speculator turned the surrounding area and the lake into a retreat for the wealthy, including Andrew Mellon, Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Carnegie. The people who lived below the dam, in Johnstown, PA, often worked at the retreat and sometimes mingled with the elite of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. For the most part, though, Johnstown and the Club were separate worlds-until they were united by the catastrophic flood of 1889 that took more than 2000 lives. For Frank Fallon and others who live and work in Johnstown, death and destruction overpower all else. For the club members, making amends proves of little help in alleviating their permanent sense of guilt. In her descriptions of Mellon, Frick, and Carnegie, the author contrasts the lives of the elite with those of the Fallon family and others in Johnstown's workforce to present a perspective on the flood's destruction from many economic levels. In the end, the tragedy overwhelms all of the survivors and makes for an unforgettable story.",

        "Using the 1889 flood of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, as a backdrop, this historical fiction is about ambition, power, passion, and tragedy. Up in the hills, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club is built for the wealthy as a getaway. Below is bustling Johnstown, where the lives of the people mean nothing to the club members. Separating the two is a neglected earth dam the townspeople joke about and the club members ignore. Although some of the people are real (Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie), Cambor imagines their lives and creates other characters to personalize the tragedy: Frank Fallon, whose marriage slowly crumbled after the death of two of his children; Grace Macintyre, who escaped an oppressive life to start over; James Talbot, lawyer for the club, who struggles to balance his ambitions with the knowledge of the dam's safety; and Daniel Fallon, Frank's son, who breaks the rules and falls in love with a club member's daughter. Although it is obvious Cambor blames the club for the tragedy, the story is well written, balanced, and infused with rich detail.",
