        "One of McCall Smith's particular talents is his ability to portray archetypes without resorting to stereotype or cliche. Thus we immediately recognise the Edinburgh chartered surveyor, stalwart of the Conservative Association, who dreams of membership to Muirfield golf club. We have the pushy Stockbridge mother, and her prodigiously talented five-year-old son, who is making good progress with the saxophone and with his Italian. Then there is Domenica Macdonald who, rather like Miss Jean Brodie, is that type of Edinburgh lady who sees herself as a citizen of a broader intellectual world. In McCall Smith's hands such characters retain charm and novelty, simultaneously arousing both mirth and empathy. 44 Scotland Street is vintage McCall Smith, tackling issues of trust and honesty, snobbery and hypocrisy, love and loss, but all with great lightness of touch. Clever, elegant and funny, this is a novel that provides huge entertainment but which is underpinned by the moral dilemmas of everyday life and the characters' struggles to resolve them."

        "Review",
        "... The characters are splendid: Mr JLB Matekoni, Mma Makutsi, the insubordinate apprentices at the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage and the fearsome Mme Potakwani are all beautifully rendered, becoming more likeable with every volume... There is nothing fancy about these novels, but they are quite unike anything I've read before. They're refreshing, funny and life-affirming.",

        "Geographical, the magazine of the Royal Geographical Society",
        "... Mma Ramotswe is part priest, part marriage guidance counsellor. She checks out suitors, finds stolen property and traces missing relatives. Above all, she listens, talks common sense and gives advice, not all of which is heeded",
        "Alan Taylor,",
        "Sunday Herald",
        "a treasure of a writer whose books deserve immediate devouring",
        "Marcel Berlins,",
        "The Guardian",
        "McCall is precise and laidback, perfectly in tune with the African pace and rhythm that he evokes.",
        "The Herald",
        "latter-day morality tales filled with endearingly idiosyncratic characters.",
        "The Resident",
        "infinitely touching, beautiful novels, each of which is a miracle of gentle wit and perception",
        "James Naughtie",
        "There are books which are funny because they pour torrents of jokes at the reader, or by organising slapstick scenes of chaos. But there are others that are more subtly humorous, and they make you laugh just by prodding you gently ... McCall Smith's feeling for pace in prose, his clarity and his affection for his characters all spring out... The books are funny because they track the meandering of ordinary lives, albeit in a gently exotic location, and bring us endlessly engaging characters. McCall Smith became our winner because he never gives the impression of straining for effect. He loves the landscape and the people of his chosen setting, Botswana, and he wants them to walk across the pages as their true selves. As as we know, that is when we are all at our funniest.",

His career has been a varied one: for many years he was a professor of Medical Law and worked in universities in the United Kingdom and abroad. Then, after the publication of his highly successful 'No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency' series, which has sold over twenty million copies, he devoted his time to the writing of fiction and has seen his various series of books translated into over forty-six languages and become bestsellers through the world. These include the Scotland Street novels, first published as a serial novel in The Scotsman, the Isabel Dalhousie novels, the Von Igelfeld series, and the Corduroy Mansions series, novels which started life as a delightful (but challenging to write) cross-media serial, written on the website of the Telegraph Media Group. This series won two major cross-media awards - Association of Online Publishers Digital Publishing Award 2009 for a Cross Media Project and the New Media Age award.\", \"In addition to these series, Alexander writes stand-alone books. 2014 sees publication of three new novels which fall into this area: 'The Forever Girl'; 'Fatty O’Leary’s Dinner Party'; and 'Emma' – a reworking of the classic Jane Austen novel. This year there will also be a stunning book on Edinburgh, 'A Work of Beauty: Alexander McCall Smith’s Edinburgh'. Earlier stand alone novels include 'La’s Orchestra Saves the World' and 'Trains and Lovers: A Hearts Journey'.\", 'Alexander is also the author of collections of short stories, academic works, and over thirty books for children. He has received numerous awards for his writing, including the British Book Awards Author of the Year Award in 2004 and a CBE for service to literature in 2007. He holds honorary doctorates from nine universities in Europe and North America. In March of 2011 he received an award from the President of Botswana for his services through literature to that country.', 'Alexander McCall Smith lives in Edinburgh. He is married to a doctor and has two daughters.']}"
