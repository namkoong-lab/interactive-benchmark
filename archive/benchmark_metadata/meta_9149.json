        "In 1605, Sir Walter Calverley’s murderous rampage leaves a family shattered. The killer suffers a torturous execution… but is it truly the end? A noble Yorkshire house stands forever tarnished by blood and possessed by anguished spirits.Some crimes are so horrific, they reverberate through the centuries. As an unhappy modern couple vacation in the guesthouse at Calverley Old Hall, playwright Clara, and her scholar husband, Scott, unwittingly awaken a dark history. Clara is trapped and forced back in time to bear witness to a family’s bloody saga. Overtaken by the malevolent echoes, Scott is pushed over the edge from possessive husband to wholly possessed…‘Murder has took this chamber with full handsAnd will ne’er out as long as the house stands.’~A Yorkshire Tragedy, Act I, Sc. vInspired by a true-life drama in Shakespeare’s day, this is itself a play within a play: a supernatural thriller with a historical core. Only one player can survive."

        "About the Author",
        "Ruth Barrett studied English Literature at Trent University and the University of Leeds, Classical Acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA), and was mentored by two-time Booker prize winner Peter Carey through the Humber School for Writers. During her years as an actor, Ruth performed in a little-known play called 'A Yorkshire Tragedy' sometimes attributed to Shakespeare. The story of the murderous Yorkshire nobleman and his long-suffering wife proved fascinating well beyond the stage... the eerie Calverley Old Hall was explored, and a haunting idea for a novel emerged. Ruth has published numerous short works of quirky and creepy fiction in various anthologies. 'Base Spirits' is her first full-length book, and her suspenseful short story 'Family Secrets' is also available on Kindle. Look for more of Ruth's writing in the future through the Spirited Words Book Co.",
