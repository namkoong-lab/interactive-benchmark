        "The Speaker",
        "weaves a mystery throughout the mayhem of America's political arena, going straight to the heart of what it truly means to be an American. The country is in legislative, economical, and moral turmoil. The next presidential election looms near, and political parties are at each other's throats. The nation's future stands on uneasy ground. But amidst all the chaos revolving around November's preparations, one voice will stand out from the crowd--a voice speaking not only of freedom for the nation, but freedom for the soul. Nobody knows who he is or where he came from, but soon every American will know his name. This novel includes Christian values and is an exciting story that sweeps from sea to shining sea."
