        "The Bush Dyslexicon",
        "is a raucously funny ride―whether it's Bush envisioning \"a foreign-handed foreign policy\" or Miller skewering vociferous cultural conservatives like William Bennett and Lynne Cheney for their silence on Bush's particular \"West Texas version of Ebonics.\" But there is also a strong undercurrent of outrage. Only because our elections have become so dependent on television and its emphatic emptiness, says Miller, could a man of such sublime and complacent ignorance assume the highest office in the land."

        "In W.'s world, political messages resignate, racial quotas vulcanize society, outstretched hands are shaked, and Bush himself is consistently misunderestimated. Bushspeak II has been a mother lode for the quickie-book industry, but Miller's is the first contribution to the genre that goes beyond the hearty (if cheap) laughs to be had by simply reprinting the man's words. Here the Bushisms provide the spine for a bracing, entertaining, and wrathful polemic; behind the malapropisms, Miller finds a po- litical and media malaise that's more worrisome than just having a President to whom it's all Grecian.
