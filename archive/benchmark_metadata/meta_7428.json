        "Samuel Beckett once wrote that were he in the 'unfortunate position' of a critic studying his work, one of his points of departure would be the ideas of the seventeenth-century philosopher, Arnold Geulincx. Samuel Beckett and Arnold Geulincx: Tracing 'a literary fantasia' is the first full-length study to document the extent of the influence Geulincx's philosophy had on Beckett's prose and late drama. Establishing itself as a reference point for Beckett's published and unpublished writings, David Tucker's study presents a clear, chronological exploration of Beckett's engagement with Geulincx, and of how this engagement marks, and is marked by, broader changes in Beckett's aesthetic thinking. By positioning close, interpretative philosophical readings alongside analyses of archival materials, Tucker sets out an affirmative and reconciliatory approach to divergent strands in contemporary Beckett Studies."

        "Review",
        "“One of the merit's of Tucker's study is that it bolsters a careful consideration of the historical and the archival evidence with a close attention to the texture of Beckett's texts. Just as important, it attempts an evenhanded appraisal of previous readers' under- and over-estimation of Geulincx's significance for Beckett...The most well-researched account of Beckett and Geulincx that we are likely to get...Tucker's study succeeds admirably in this regard, and in doing so performs a long-overdue service to Beckett studies. Accordingly, this book will also serve as a key reference point for the fast-growing body of scholarship on Beckett and philosophy more broadly.” ―",
