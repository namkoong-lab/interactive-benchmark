        "As the US Civil War was raging, between 1860 and 1870 Canada was involved in its own series of military events, such as the presence of the British Army in Canada, due largely to the tensions caused by the Civil War, the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1870, and the Red River Expedition. These events have often been overshadowed by those south of the border. Enhanced by full color plates and rare photographs of Montreal photographer William Notman, this fine text examines the Canadian campaigns from 1860-70, while illustrating the uniforms of the Canadian Volunteer Militia, the British Army and staff officers."
