        "The book is pure fiction, sometimes touching lightly on fantasy but always returning to earth with a ripe pungency. --",
        "Mendocino Beacon, March 2, 2000",
        "This episodic novel conjure[s] Kahlo as a mutable entity living through three artists as they navigate life, love and art. --",
        "Publisher's Weekly, August 16, 1999",
        "From the Publisher",
        "Derivitive of Michael Cunningham's acclaimed re-envisioning of the famous persona of Mrs. Dalloway in The Hours, FRIDA KAHLO/FRIDA KAHLO is still charming readers with its three generations of Frida Kahlos."
