        "When Froelich disappears from his permanent perch atop a giant ladder, his nephew embarks on a madcap quest to find him in this nineteenth century adventure novel, set in a reimagined Pacific Northwest landscape inhabited by resolute young women who outwit their guardians, skittish Civil War veterans, hungry clouds, and a few murderers, all seeking their own versions of the American dream."

        "“From the first page to the last,",
        "Froelich’s Ladder",
        "brims with color, intrigue, and verve. At once a fantastical, madcap adventure and a poignant meditation on independence and solitude, it’s the kind of book that captivates you quickly and whisks you high into the atmosphere. I was in thrall to the surreal Oregon landscape, populated by tycoons and grifters, cross-dressers and hungry clouds. This debut is clever, irreverent, and ultimately unforgettable.”– Leslie Parry, author of",

        "Froelich’s Ladder",
        "paints a picture of the American frontier that’s more original—yet perhaps more true—than any I’ve encountered in a long, long time. Readers who appreciate the cockeyed historical vision of writers like Charles Portis, Thomas Berger, Richard Brautigan, and Patrick deWitt need to add Jamie Duclos-Yourdon to their to-read lists today.”– Steve Hockensmith,",

It’s reminiscent of the works of Patrick deWitt, though entirely its own thing. I loved the magic and the tall tale-ness and the characters and I wish there were more books in the world that were creating new folklores and fairy tales.

Brothers Froelich and Harald have a fight that lasts decades and sends Froelich up the fourth-tallest ladder in the history of the world. There he stays and stays, until one day he is missing. An unbelievably charming story with the quirkiest of characters, Froelich’s Ladder is required reading for Pacific Northwest lovers. Duclos-Yourdon clearly has a long career ahead of him.”– Dianah Hughley, bookseller, Powell’s Books“In",
        "Froelich’s Ladder,",
        "Jamie Duclos-Yourdon debuts an impeccably crafted adventure in the best tall tale tradition. The men and women of his frontier Oregon are keenly drawn and brilliantly, painfully human, as is the book itself, touched with wit and whimsy and saturated with longing. Duclos-Yourdon’s deft, lyrical prose gives the novel an impressive, addictive fairy-tale sensibility, and marks it as one of those rare reads that simultaneously evokes and transcends its wholly original time and place.”– Tracy Manaster, author of",

With logging camps, confederate spies, and industrious builders, this book is at once a lesson in Oregon history and a lesson in the unexpected. Overall, it's a joy to read; it's evocative of a different time, and a tale that's taller than the ladder Froelich builds.\"– Kate Ristau, author of",

The underlying theme of alienation was played out well throughout the novel. It reminds the reader that we will always need to reach out to one another through whatever means and in whatever language.
