        "Lexi P. is back with her big imagination and even bigger message. In The Ice Cream Talk, Lexi shares a positive message about “loving your flavor” — which is an analogy she uses for kids to understand the importance of diversity, inclusion, and more importantly, “learning to love the skin you're in.” Once again, as with her first book, Curly Girls Love Your Curls, self-esteem is Lexi’s main theme. Her beautifully illustrated book reinforces the importance of “loving self” — no matter one’s race, color, body type or culture — by sharing a lesson she learned from her “Grammy,” that’s for readers of all ages. Lexi wants everyone to remember: “We all come from various backgrounds, with a lot of different flavors but we are all family, members of humanity. No matter what flavor you are, remember to love the skin that you’re in.”"

        "About the Author",
        "Child author Lexi P. is a creative and adventurous 12-year-old girl with a big imagination and even bigger hair. She is an honor-roll student who loves to serve her community. She is an active Girl Scout member who eagerly mentors younger girls in her troop. Lexi has a passion for writing and saw the need to share her personal story about learning to love herself. In her debut book, Curly Gurls, Lexi did just that: She shared a positive message about how loving your natural hair reinforces the importance of self-esteem. Her second book the Ice Cream Talk expands the topic of self love even more. The young author is a strong believer in following your dreams and believing in yourself. Through what she is envisioning as a series of children's books, Lexi P. plans on sharing with the world her many adventures and life-lessons."
