So many pursuits count as scavenging today that they can no longer be tucked into any easy little category.

You scavenge just by tracking down a good bargain.",

Back then—not so long ago—it was assumed that buying things new, retail, was the only way in which respectable civilized human beings could get them.

Hunting and gathering downtown, eyes to the ground in an urban landscape, the authors of this book found, in one week: a pearl-and-amber earring, four free-sample cans of pomegranate soda, two empty wire-handled five-gallon plastic vats, three bus transfers worth twenty-five cents apiece, a mysterious doohickey that turned out to be a digital pedometer, eighty-seven cents in change, and a ten-dollar bill. One day we plucked a clutch of perfumey, fuzzy-fleshed, creamy-meated Chinese loquats from a dark-leafed tree. Some days we find nothing. Last Saturday we bought an electric hedge trimmer at a yard sale for two bucks. Later that day, in a box marked FREE, we found fourteen shirts. We go days at a span without even opening our wallets. Our garden grows with scavenged seeds. Sometimes we do not know what they are when we plant them and find out only when plants come up: tomatoes, collards, tomatillos, parsley, three kinds of bok choy. You never know.",

        "WE, THE AUTHORS Of THIS BOOK, have scavenged for as long as we can remember. We didn’t know each other when we were kids—lived in different cities far apart, though contemporaneously. Yet each of us, in his or her own way, was foraging, scrounging, saving, and repurposing practically as soon as he or she could walk and talk. One of us lived near a beach and was frequently taken there. Found shells, smooth pebbles, sea glass, driftwood, sand, and dried seaweed turned into countless dollhouse furnishings and early art projects even before the first day of first grade. Another of us lived in a town studded with hippie communes, whose residents demonstrated how to construct furniture from scrap wood and to pick plums from sidewalk trees. One of us was mocked by classmates for picking up spare change from the street or sidewalk. The other one searched for coins at the feet of parking meters first thing in the morning in order to buy lunch at school. Ten years before we met, both of us bought metal detectors, in both cases the cheapest Radio Shack model. One of us trolled the beach. The other trolled parks and playgrounds. In college, still not having yet met, we filled our closets with thrift-shop clothes, our shelves with secondhand textbooks, and our fridges with leftovers from the restaurants where we worked. Once we met, neither of us ever had to explain or apologize to the other for bending down to pick up coins or standing on tiptoes to peer inside Dumpsters. In all these years, choosing the least expensive item, place, or option has never sparked a spat. We do not socialize with others much, for better or worse. We know that, behind our backs, others surmise that we are parsimonious or poor. Or they remember encounters like this: One day we were at the home of a friend when she realized that she needed to jot a quick note for the postal carrier. A trash bag at her feet was full of scrap paper on which she could have jotted it: torn envelopes, wrappers, receipts. Rather than grab one of these and scribble the note on it, she sighed, strode over to a desk, opened a drawer, and pulled a sheet of thick, expensive stationery from a silver box. Upon this creamy monogrammed sheet, she scribbled: “Leave packages on porch.” “Okay,” she said, and stood.",
        "We gazed at her as if she were an alien.",
        "She gazed back at us the same way.",

        "What?",
        "Sometimes scavenging is the Great Divide.",

        "do",
        "know: Free is the best price.",

Having, each of us, shattered the chains that locked us to consumer culture, we walk free under a clear new sky, scanning a changed terrain studded with buried treasure.",

        "And wordlessly we diverge from our route, follow the arrow on the sign and arc left to where we see balloons and clamor halfway down the block, and",
        "ahhh.",
        "It’s not just any yard sale but a big one, stretching from the sidewalk, where blue satin cushions lean against a stop sign, up a driveway studded with chairs, and across a front lawn strewn with clothes, books, tools, kitchenware, toys. As luck would have it, this yard sale is ending just as we arrive. From her porch, the seller announces that the sale is over and that everything remaining is now free for the taking.",
        "Not all sales end this way. Some sellers pack their unsold stuff back up and haul it inside or drive it to Goodwill. Some, though, give it all away. When word gets out, a buzz goes through the air and everything speeds up. Hands dart. Receptacles are sought to hold the DVDs, the baseball mitt, the vase.",
        "This is a free-for-all.",
        "At any free-for-all, you can immediately spot the inexperienced. Gobsmacked, they hover over pomanders and clocks but reach for nothing, as if fearing germs or tricks or that they will be called thieves.",
        "And you can spot the scavengers. We glide, our movements purposeful and lithe. Our eyes cut wide arcs, back and forth. We gaze from side to side, like lighthouse beacons, even as we kneel and reach with one hand for shirts—",
        "stripes, button-down, yes",
        "—and with the other for swim goggles, garden gloves, a blender. Yoink! Into the backpack pops the spoon, the copper horse, the coffeepot. Quick. Competent. Assess each item in a nanosecond. Do I want this? Do I need it? Show it to a friend and ask: Do you?",
        "We will be late to the family party. And when we get there and they ask why we are late and we say we were scavenging free clothes and toys and kitchenware from a stranger’s front lawn, they laugh. When they see we are serious, they withdraw from us with shocked looks and ask: But why? Wasn’t it dirty? What if someone bled on those shirts? What if someone cooked meth in that coffeepot? What if the blender’s broken? Can’t you afford new goggles?",

        "How do we tell them how it is for us? How do we tell them that, for us, old stuff and stuff that has been owned before acquires a patina composed of history and mystery, almost a soul? How do we say that a shiny new nickel is just cash to us but an oxidized greenish 1954 nickel, worn so smooth that Thomas Jefferson lacks eyes, excites us, sets our minds skittering up and down the years, wondering,",

How can we explain the size of landfills, the amount of solid waste now littering the Earth? Do we cite findings by the Clean Air Council that every American alive discards fifty-six tons of trash per year? Do we mention the millions of pounds of trash floating on the seas? Do we say that, by scavenging, we can make a dent in these figures?",
        "How do we tell them we appreciate our scavenged goods in ways they cannot possibly appreciate their brand-new full-price purchases? How can we say that every scavenged item came to us in a unique, often unexpected way, so each one adds another story to our lives? How can we say: Full-price shopping is easy, but scavenging takes talent, luck, skill, and expertise? Thus every scavenged item is a reward or a miracle. How can we explain that not paying full price for things gives us the best assessment of true value: we appreciate our scavenged goods not for how much they cost us but for what they have been through and what they are.",
        "How can we tell standard consumers that every saved penny counts, that saved pennies add up? They call us cheap. They call us poor. Yet the average standard consumer carries a four-figure debt. How can we make them understand that they accumulated these debts by paying full price? How can we say: What would you prefer—discount-outlet food, library DVDs to watch, and no debt; or restaurant food, cinema tickets, and debt? How do we show them that what they would call insufferable sacrifices set us free?",
        "Do we say: We shrink landfills?",
        "Do we say: We are archaeologists?",
        "Do we say: Not buying at full price makes us creative, independent, self-sufficient, clear-sighted, communitarian, appreciative, liberated, and adventurous?",

        "FINDING AS IDENTITY",
        "We always find stuff. We two authors. Us.",
        "We find stuff everywhere: some of it you would want, some you would not. The Ray-Ban sunglasses. Ripe apricots. The life-sized lifelike rubber vampire bat, with rubber string for easy, bouncy hanging. None of it our choice, but that’s the point. We find it, but more likely it finds us. Sometimes we feel like it’s almost cosmic, like we’re plugged into some kind of magic network, like we find certain stuff at certain times for certain reasons.",
        "Shhh,",
        "though. That’s too weird. Don’t tell.",
        "We pluck nickels from gutters, toasters from thrift-shop shelves, and Kate Spade bags from other people’s trash. When one of us was six, her father asked what she would be when she grew up. She said she didn’t know. A nurse, her father said, a ballerina? She said no. He snorted: Okay then—a beachcomber? He was trying to be sarcastic. She took it as instructions.",
        "Okay, Dad!",
        "Imagining the palm-frond hat, the shack.",
        "It has come true.",
        "Scavenging, finding the slightly damaged radio, the box of wartime-Tokyo photographs, feels like rescue, feels like recovery, feels like discovery.",
        "It feels like victory.",
        "Some scavenged finds feel like gifts whose meaning—hmmm, a deck of transparent playing cards—we will someday grasp. This makes them numinous. If we have any faith, it is in luck. Everyday grails. Some scavengers procure commodities: they barter and resell. For some, scavenging is an ethos, not a source of income but an income extender, just as Hamburger Helper extends ground beef. The more we find, the less we buy.",
        "Some, like us, can’t bring ourselves to eat food rescued from Dumpsters; others don’t flinch. We all have our limits. But still:",
