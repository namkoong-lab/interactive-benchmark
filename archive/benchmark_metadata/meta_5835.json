        "We are proud to introduce the new Megan Racing high-performance aluminum radiator. Anytime an individual introduces their car to a racing/drifting environment, the temperature of the vehicle's engine will skyrocket. One common and effective method of reducing engine temperature is to employ an aluminum radiator.",
        "This is a cost-effective upgrade that can ultimately save an engine during competition or spirited driving. Often times, a temperature drop of twenty degrees or more will be noticed when using an aluminum radiator. Also included is a 1.1 BAR radiator cap.",
        "Installation:",
        "Please FLUSH the radiator before installation and properly take all the air pockets out. If",

        "overheat",
        "due to low coolant or air pockets in the cooling system.",
