        "Z36 Truck and Tow brake pads has superior stopping power that is demanded by those who tow and haul, as well as the off-road enthusiast. Any time you add weight to a vehicle by hauling a load, towing a trailer, or simply adding a larger wheel/tire combination, you change the operating conditions of your stock brake package. Those operating conditions may exceed the ability of the stock braking components. But don’t worry, Z36 pads provide the extra stopping power to bring your rig to a halt quickly! They are made from premium stainless-steel shims, which provide better heat dissipation And virtually noise-free braking. Power Stop’s Z36 truck and tow brake pads are low dust formula designed to maximize stopping power and keep those wheels clean!"
