        "No alternatives are more favored by plants than Natural Coconut Fiber Liner",
        "1. Moisture Regulating",
        "Unlike their alternatives, coco liners can regulate your soil's moisture levels so that plants stay healthy.",
        "Coco liners can hold up to 8x their weight in water. Excessive water will drain the flower pot through the gaps. And when the soil dries out., the moisture in the fiber will be slowly released to the plant.",
        "This makes the right balance of moisture a lot easier!",
        "2. Good Aeration",
        "The porous structure of the fiber ensures that the roots can carry out sufficient respiration, especially aerobic respiration, which can protect the young roots and help them absorb more energy.",
        "3. Enhance Plant Resistance",
        "Coco liners have a neutral pH, natural traces of potassium and phosphorous, which can protect your plants, and enhance plant health.",
        "4. More Durable",
        "TigeJoy coco liner can last through multiple growing seasons. Like any other material, no coco liner will last forever. However, We chose tougher coco fiber and used integrated indentation to make a pre-formed liner, resisting both time and decomposition.",
        "5. Natural Fertilizer",
        "Because they are 100% natural, coco liners are also biodegradable! Plant them (along with your plants) directly into the soil or mix the liner into the dirt for natural fertilizer."
