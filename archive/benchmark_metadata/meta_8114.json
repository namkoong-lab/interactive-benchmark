        "www.ultimateclosetguide.com On average, women spend $150-$400 a month on clothing, wear only about 20% of what's in their closets on a regular basis, and have around $550 worth of clothing in there collecting dust. We're buying more, wearing less, and creating more clutter. So, now what? After over a decade working in the fashion industry at luxury retail institution Neiman Marcus (buying offices to e-commerce) and hundreds of personal styling clients, Witkin has written the one interactive workbook that will empower any woman, anywhere to create the closet she has always wanted, in 30 days. Know what to wear and what to shop for each season so you can look your best everyday without having to think about it. It's like having a personal stylist in your closet at a fraction of the cost.
