        "Haley Marchand needs money. So when a request comes for her to be both temporary secretary and fiancee, she jumps at the chance. As luck would have it, she falls on her face in the driveway. Entrepreneur Rand McNeil naturally says she won't do. Things take a turn for the worse when he degrades her elfin face and wild hair. Now Haley's on the defensive, and heaven help \"Mr. nobody-should-look-this-good. Because he lied to his former fiancee, Rand needs someone who, in addition to having topnotch secretarial skills, can pose as his fiancee for one evening as he finalizes a pivotal business merger. He needs someone tall and classy, and instead gets someone perky and cute. No way his high-and-mighty ex and her father will believe he'd be engaged to someone like her. Can Rand keep the unpredictable Haley from turning his life, and emotions, into total chaos? Can Haley keep her attraction to hot-and-cold Rand under control as she challenges his diehard conviction that marriage is only for idiots?"
