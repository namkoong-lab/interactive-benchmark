        "In the long-awaited sequel to 1999's Queen of Denial... Five years have passed since Drewcila Qwah set Barious on its ear by turning the entire country into a huge salvaging operation. The people are happy, the economy is healthy, and Drewcila Qwah has become the most powerful Salvager in the entire universe. But even in the best of situations, there's always someone who's going to bitch. Zarco is tired of being Drewcila's puppet -- taking orders from the woman who's supposed to be his wife and queen yet is screwing everyone but him, and who has turned his once beautiful and regal kingdom into a harborage of space scum and the galaxy's finest garbage. Van Gar is tired of playing second fiddle to his unfaithful mate, and the Lockeds-the Barions' sworn enemies-want a piece of the salvaging pie. Oh what's a girl to do? Start kicking asses and taking names, that's what!"

        "\"RECYCLED is one hot SOB. It rocks with writerly rhythm and a beautiful and funny vulgarity.\" --",
        "Joe R. Lansdale",
        "From the Author",
        "\"The Drewcila Qwah novels are the end result of way too many hits to the head, too much alcohol, working in construction for enough years to pick up the vocabulary, and my own and strong belief that all the world's true ills could be solved if only we would all clean up our own damn messes.",
        "I am a huge believer in recycling. The idea that we generate so much garbage amazes me, and the fact that we throw away so many things without thinking of whether someone else might think they were still good or what they might now become repulses me.",
        "We have *no* trash service. We recycle everything that comes into our home. I make blocks from tin cans, plastic trash items, etc. We burn or shred all our paper items, the ash is put into our flowerbeds, and the shredded paper is composted or put into the worm bed. I turn my aluminum in for the cash, and I make walls of glass bottles.",
        "A few years ago Lynn's parents bought a new refrigerator. We took their old one and gave our old one to my parents, who in turn gave their old one to a boot-legger who used it to cool his beer. Now that's recycling!!!\"",
        "About the Author",
        "Selina Rosen lives in rural Arkansas with her partner of 11 years, assorted barnyard animalswhich she doesnt use for kinky sexual practices despite what you may have heardand an Amazon parrot with a piss-poor attitude.",
        "She and her partner own and operate Yard Dog Press, a micro press that deals with the oddball children of many Sci-fi, Fantasy and Horror writers. About running a small press Ms. Rosen remarks, \"Hey! Its cheaper than paying for a full time dominatrix, and it hurts just as much.\"",
        "Her hobbies include sword fighting, gardening, building things from trash, drinking large amounts of beer, and seeing if she can belch loud enough to call in wild geese.",
        "Her short fiction has appeared in Sword and Sorceress 16, Distant Journeys, three of the MZB Fantasy Mags, Such a Pretty Face, and Personal Demons to name a few. She will have a story entitled \"Ritual Evolution\" in the upcoming Thieves World anthology, Turning Points. She edited YDPs Stories That Wont Make Your Parents Hurl, and the shared universe anthology Bubbas of the Apocalypse.",
        "A collection of her short fiction, The Bubba Chronicles (YDP), can be hadas she canrather cheaply.",
        "Her novels include The Host trilogy (YDP), Fire and Ice (YDP), and Hammer Town (YDP); Queen of Denial (Meisha Merlin Publishing), Chains of Freedom (MMP), Chains of Destruction (MMP), and Recycled, the sequel to Queen of Denial comes out in May of 2003 from MMP.",
        "She is currently working on the third Chains book, Chains of Redemption, which is slated for May of 2004, and murder mystery collaboration with fantasy author Laura J. Underwood, tentatively titled Bad Lands.",
