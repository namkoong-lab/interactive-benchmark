        "One of the most successful artists of 2000, Macy Gray won the Grammy™ for Best Female Pop Vocal, took her debut album double platinum and produced the #1 smash \"I Try.\" Her second album, The Id, features a duet with Erykah Badu on the first single, \"Sweet Baby.\"",

        "filled a void that no one knew existed. The eccentric singer's unusual voice--more sand than gravel--and her eyebrow-raising lyrics consumed a massive space that was accessible but also controversial. After all the hype surrounding her just-add-water superstardom, the daunting question her follow-up,",

Once again, her lyrical sensibility is gripping, vacillating from whimsical (\"Oblivion\") to disturbing (\"Gimme All Your Lovin' or I Will Kill You\"). In all, Macy Gray continues to wave her R&B freak flag while digging deep in the trenches of the vividly real.",
