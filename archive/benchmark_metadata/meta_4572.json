        "Carbon tool steel bandsaw blades are designed to work with a woodcutting saw to cut all types of woods 800-3,500 fpm; especially ideal for soft woods, i.e. pine, polar, fir and spruce. If used with a good release agent, it can cut plastics at a range of 200-800 fpm, or non-ferrous metal ( i.e. aluminum, copper and brass ) at a range of 200-1,000 fpm. However, to cut ferrous metals or mild steel ( don't cut hard steel ), you must only use a metal-cutting saw at a range of 40-200 fpm. Having liquid coolant running along the back of the blade yields the best results is highly recommended. The following is a guideline for choosing an adequate tooth pattern to cut metal materials, Use * 24 raker to cut 1/16\" to 1/4\" thick material, * 18 raker to cut 1/8\" to 3/8\" thick material,* 14 raker to cut 3/16\" to 7/16\" thick material,* 10 raker to cut 1/4\" to 5/8\" thick material,* 6 Hook to cut 3/8\" to 2\" thick material,* 4 Hook to cut 3/4\" to 4-1/2\" thick material,* 3 Hook to cut 1\" to 6\" thick material,* 2 Hook to cut 2\" to 12\" thick material. All Magnate bandsaw blades are welded and fabricated in the USA. The coils/material are USA brands but may not be made in the USA. All band saw blades’ pictures depict a general bandsaw blade and thus may look different from each particular item. Warning: For packaging purposes, this blade is folded into a coiled position which is similar to a spring and may pop open when being coiled or uncoiled. Wear heavy duty leather gloves and eye/body protection while using extreme care when coiling or uncoiling a blade. Failure to exercise the proper care could result in serious bodily injury. See your bandsaw owner's manual for further safety instructions. Please refer to your owner's/operation manual to make sure the blade's length, width and thickness can fit your bandsaw machine."
