        "The classic Luminox case design with the protected crown balanced by an opposite outcropping has often been compared to the shape of a turtle. Applied to the Luminox SEA series watches, the now iconic Luminox case design is referred to as the “turtle-shape” case. The Leatherback Sea Turtle Giant Turtle features an impressive 44 mm CARBONOX case and water resistance up to 100 meters. Its blue dial with white numbers provides maximum readability during the day. At night, the proven Luminox Light Technology lighting system assumes this function. \"Always Visible\", self-powered, for up to 25 years."
