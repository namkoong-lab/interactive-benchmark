Although Betty was never a real person, her name and identity have become synonymous with helpfulness, trustworthiness and quality.', 'Betty Crocker has survived the decades by providing consumers with food information and food products that are contemporary without being faddish. The first hardcover cookbook, Betty Crocker’s Picture Cookbook was published in 1950 and quickly became a national best seller. Since then, more than 250 Betty Crocker cookbooks have been published.']}"
