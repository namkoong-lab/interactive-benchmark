        "is Thomas Benigno's darkest and most disturbing novel to date. Frightening and heart warming at the same time, the authors he has admired the most--John Grisham, Stephen King and even Pat Conroy--rise from the ashes of this heart pounding page turner to make this novel Benigno's best.",
        "Readers Favorite Review 5 STARS:",
        "\"Superbly written, The Criminal Mind by Thomas Benigno is a sensational novel in the Nick Mannino series. Filled with mystery and suspense, it is a riveting story with an intricate plot, complex story line, and intriguing characters.",
        "Spellbinding twists coil throughout, coming to a horrifying and heart-stopping conclusion. Distinctive characters who have acute moral, physical, emotional, and mental issues add context to the story line. Their contrasting personalities, challenges, and attitudes give the plot definition and balance. Although this is the third book in the series, the book does well as a standalone. Nick's previous exploits that are relevant to the plot ease into the story line without interrupting the flow of the story. Engaging and intense, it is a gripping novel with a compelling and suspenseful plot that promises to thrill fans of mystery, thrillers, and suspense.\"",

        "It was 8:00 a.m. and the ground was still wet from the rain. The tractor's shovel bore deeper than the driver intended, and when it rose into the air, the rectangular box of gray-aged wood was lifted but otherwise undisturbed. It was a clean scoop, and when the excess dirt and rocks were shaken loose, the box remained largely unscathed. If not for a break in the clouds and the early morning sun, it might have gone unnoticed, routinely dumped in a waiting truck to be hauled away and dropped into an even larger pile of dirt, sand, and unearthed gravel.            Diego was a Mexican American and a citizen of the United States for over fifteen years. The home he shared with his wife and five kids was in a suburb just outside Ithaca, New York. Every morning he woke up at 4:00 a.m. to start his shift at 7:00 a.m., seventy miles away outside the small town of Cartersville. This day, his foreman put him on the tractor. The last thing Diego wanted was to find a box in the dirt that resembled the coffin of a small child. Two years earlier, he had buried his son in one the same size. The boy had died of brain cancer and was three years old.            At first, Diego thought he had found a hidden crate of rifles. He was tempted to put it back, bury it deeper, and not get involved as a witness against 'the wrong people.' Then he thought again. Perhaps these were the remains of someone whose family could not afford a proper burial.             He leveled the shovel to just a few feet off the ground. Arms wide, he stepped off the tractor, gritted his teeth and gripped the sides of the box. It was lighter than he expected. He gently placed it on the ground. After hesitating for a moment, he tried to lift the cover off. But it was nailed shut. He thought about calling his foreman, who cared only about time and money and keeping on schedule, and then thought again. Although Diego feared the ramifications of what he might find, he was a religious man and would not be able to live with himself if he dumped the box without knowing.            He climbed back on to the tractor, grabbed a large screwdriver from his tool bag, stepped off, and pried open the box only to have his worst fear realized.             Inside he found the skeleton of a young child, and alongside it, a tarnished copy of the children's book,",

Y. After graduating Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan in 1979, at the behest of his Criminal Law Clinic Professor, Barry Scheck (who later obtained fame for representing O. J. Simpson) he was fast-tracked to a position as Associate Attorney with the New York City Legal Aid Society in the Bronx. While there he sought out and tackled the grittiest of cases, even representing the infamous Spiderman Rapist. If you ask him why he repeatedly took on the defense of child molesters and rapists, he'll sound off two reasons: 1) no other attorney would take these cases, and 2) he was young and out to prove himself. The year before he left Legal Aid to go into private practice he was featured in a two page spread in the New York City Legal Aid Society's Annual Report for his success in winning what seemed like an unwinnable case-a teacher's aide charged with molesting three of his students. At a party held in his honor he was handed a beautiful plaque commemorating his court victory-a plaque he never hung up or put on display ever. Two years later he left Legal Aid, and within eighteen months after that, left the practice of criminal law behind forever, having never lost a trial. He currently practices law on Long Island, has appeared as an actor in two movies, one an award winning short film, and even produced (along with others) a Broadway show (Burn the Floor and its U.S. tour). He is married to the same beautiful woman since shortly after graduating law school and has three adult children. THE GOOD LAWYER is a novel inspired by real events while he was working as a Legal Aid Attorney in the South Bronx. His second novel, THE CRIMINAL LAWYER, is inspired by real crimes that occurred on Long Island in 2010. His latest novel is THE CRIMINAL MIND, a psychological thriller.\"]}"
