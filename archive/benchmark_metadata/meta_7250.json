Tackling difficult issues such as school blues, parental relationships, and future fears, these quick-witted and humorous devotions each include an attention-grabbing opener, an explanation with application of Scripture, and a take-away Bible verse. Parents and youth alike agree that these fun, fresh devotions will keep teens reading. Kevin Johnson's one-of-a-kind devotionals are never preachy--but always punchy."
