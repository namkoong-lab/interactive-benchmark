        "Reviewed by Jack Magnus for Readers' Favorite\"Anyone who's ever been lost in the woods at night, and I have, will especially appreciate PerryAnn and MatiLou's night out on the mountain as they hunker down in the dark... Passel's story is nature writing at its finest...Her characters are finely drawn, and the environmental concerns raised throughout the tale are stark and compelling. Summer of Change is most highly recommended.\".",

It took eight years because each time I finished one I had to take a break. The novellas needed special care and were hard to write! They are about environmental concern and painful experiences and coming through to the other side. And they are about friendship, learning lessons and appreciating the gifts in life.', 'MatiLou and PerryAnn’s stories demanded to be told. I did not plot their experiences out in a neat outline; I simply wrote what came to me as I typed along. The writing is intentionally simple to include all readers. The novellas occur within a thirty year span. I wrote them so that any one book can be read individually; however, reviewers have suggested reading the entire series.', 'As the author, I tried to record the girls’ hope, what they felt and learned, much of their dialogue, and what they gained and lost along the way. Although fiction, their journey resonates with current times. It seems to me the stories are at a good place to end, but who knows? If there is more to record, I will gladly type away.', '\"Painted Moment\"', 'On a trail out west, I’m on a mustang, and I am free. The cowboy ahead leads the way. There’s nowhere else to be. We climb the hill in silence our horses watching their steps. An osprey stares down from a nest as we make our way ahead. The cowboy stops on top at the ridge and looks across the vast land. I can’t see his face, just the rump of his horse. I stop and look too, as my mount stands.', 'By the river, are signs of man. Buildings, equipment, a turbine reaching high. But on the ridge and mountains beyond, only wide-open space, where land meets sky. The wind is blowing approval. I sigh. I think maybe so does he. But I can’t see his windswept face to know exactly what he sees.', 'In one painted moment, just for now, with progress contained to the valley below, we are free up high out west on a ridge.', 'But then we head down, easy and slow.', 'Martha Passel']}"
