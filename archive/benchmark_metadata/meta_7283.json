        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreSchool-K-- A bedtime book in which a mother reviews the day's events for her young son as she prepares him for sleep. A walk through the countryside for some birdwatching, flower gathering, picnicking, treasure hunting, and storytelling is related in a rhyme that is soothing but uninspired. Sweet's soft, yet colorful, illustrations are appealing--particularly in small details such as scattered toys and the child's drawings on the wall--but they lack originality and, with the exception of the tree frog, detailed insets do not enhance the format. The unlikelihood of picking \"daisies and violets to put in a glass\" represents a textual inaccuracy that is exacerbated by the accompanying illustrations of blooming daffodils and a fully grown vegetable patch. With so many distinguished bedtime books available, this latest addition seems superfluous.",
