        "The Eleventh Edition of this market-leading text continues its tradition of providing a solid foundation of economic understanding for use in managerial decision making. It offers a practical treatment of economic theory and analysis in an intuitive, calculus-based format. Its focus is on presenting those aspects of economic theory and analysis that are most relevant to students of business administration, and a wide variety of examples and simple numerical problems are used to illustrate the application of managerial economics to a vast assortment of practical situations. The nature of the decision process and the role that economic analysis plays in that process are emphasized throughout. This major revision is designed to maximize accessibility for a student audience with little or no background in economics, and no previous training in calculus."

        "Dr. Hirschey, I am preparing for my final in Managerial Economics, and I thought I would drop you an email to thank for writing such a great textbook. I don't know how many thank you notes you get, but you did a superb job in writing this text. I am no mathematical genius, and I really have a good shot at an A in this class. Thanks for writing something PRACTICAL.",
