        "Years ago, frightened by passion, Eve settled for less: marrying safely, building a solid, ordinary life. Now she longs for more.One day, treasure hunting for a friend’s antiques shop, she finds a mysterious instrument, carved with twining vines. It sends her on a quest—and into a compelling connection with a young man, the son of an old flame. He is twenty years younger than she is, a musician, a seeker, a bohemian—and, to her amazement, he’s pursuing her.Can this euphoric connection last? Eve finds herself defenseless against the force of her fantasies. But she cannot retreat back to safety; she is no longer the woman she was. And even now, she can hardly imagine the woman she will become.",
        "Say My Name",
        "is more than a love story. It is the story of a woman finding herself through a lover’s eyes, and discovering a strength and independence she never knew she had. On this journey of self-empowerment, Eve will jettison shame and propriety, following only the call of her spirit and the promise of a new, unconventional life.",
        "Say My Name",
        "is a clarion call to adventures of the heart, and a whisper into every woman’s ear: hear the music! It was written for you."
