        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreSchool-Grade 1–Snug in her bed, a youngster hears a distant siren and dreams of firefighters' brave escapades. With the refrain, What happened was this, she relates several imaginary adventures. The squad saves a castle full of princesses after a dragon blows on his food and starts a fire, cools a woman's mouth after she eats a hot pepper, and rescues a boy who bounces off his bed and lands on Pluto. The girl also concocts personalities for the diverse crew members, down to their favorite foods. Finally, the firefighters come to ask for her help in extinguishing the stars from the night sky. Slater's rhythmic, sometimes rhyming prose captures the child's enthusiasm, though unusual phrasings may trip up unpracticed readers while sharing the book aloud. Ceccoli's dreamy, luminescent paintings perfectly suit the story. The heroes' round faces are kind and lovable. Observant youngsters will note that the firefighters' yellow and black boots appear as yellow and blue, but this minor inconsistency will give way to delight at the image of the dragon at the table with fork and knife in hand, or the view up through city buildings of an exuberant boy tumbling through the air. A perfect choice for bedtime reading.",

        "Review",
        "Slater and Ceccoli are ideally paired, with the incantatory rhythms of the prose mirroring the velvety surfaces and Zen-like vibe of the acrylic and pastel paintings. The result is a book that's both engrossing and lulling--a wonderfully offbeat choice for bedtime.Publishers Weekly",
