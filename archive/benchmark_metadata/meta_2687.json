        "After his marriage ends, Chad Stone finds himself single again. He begins a middle-aged dating adventure in search of the last great love of his life. Told as a humorous memoir, the book also serves as a self-help guide to dating for men. For women, the book offers a unique, unvarnished look into the mind of a real man—revealing how a single man thinks and why he behaves as he does.Sprinkled throughout the book are Babe Magnet Rules that provide insightful advice for single men of all ages. Stone quickly discovers that his soul mate isn’t going to knock unannounced at his front door. (Babe Magnet Rule #9: When in doubt, a Babe Magnet gets his butt off the couch and goes out.) He learns how to woo a woman by paying attention to what women appreciate. (Babe Magnet Rule #36: Any time a man cooks a meal for a woman, he gets relationship points.) And he learns how to stand apart from all of the clueless single men. (Babe Magnet Rule #87: Be a gentleman. There are so few gentlemen left in the world these days, and being one is a great way to set yourself apart from the other men that women have been dating.) Confessions of a Middle-Aged Babe Magnet is a journey of modern self-discovery that is laugh-out-loud funny in some places and poignantly tender in others. Fascinating, fun and heartfelt, Confessions of a Middle-Aged Babe Magnet is a triumph of the human spirit and proof that love is possible at any age—as long as you’re willing to embrace it. Stone’s tongue-in-cheek “Babe Magnet” persona turns out to be merely the vehicle he uses to find the last great love of his life. This is a powerful, entertaining story with a happy ending that will make you smile and fill you with hope."
