        "Last Christmas, nothing was going Quinn’s way. Then she met him. Their connection was intense, but the timing was all wrong—so they went their separate ways. But this year, everything in her life is better. Well, almost everything. Somewhere along the line, she lost her holiday spirit. Could it be that she left it with the handsome cowboy she never quite got over?Jackson wasn’t looking for romance when he met Quinn. But there was something about her that grabbed his heart and wouldn’t let go. Now that they’re together again, he can’t help but wonder if she’d ever be willing to give up the bright lights of the city for country life with a simple rancher like him…  As stockings are hung and trees are trimmed, can Quinn and Jackson find a way to claim their second chance at happily ever after? Or will the magic of the season fail them yet again?",
