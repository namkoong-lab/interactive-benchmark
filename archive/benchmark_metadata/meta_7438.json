        "About the Author",
        "In 2000 I began writing this book, and the Both Eyes Open and Both Eyes Shut the concept just stuck with me over the years. I would put the book down and pick it up again and over time the more I grew in the word of God the more I had to add to content. I went back and forth with this project for awhile and eventually I was lead to do what was meant for me to do and that was to put out the first issue of Both Eyes Shut and Both Eyes Shut and it has opened so many doors for me in just a short time, it has been an exciting experience and I pray that the other 2 volumes will be just as fun writing along with the other writings that I have in my binds that has been storing my notebooks for years. This is only the beginning, I hope that you all will ride along with in God speed."
