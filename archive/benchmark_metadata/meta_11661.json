        "The Nikon P7000 has a sensor behind a 7.1x, optically stabilized zoom lens",

    "description": [
        "The Nikon P7000's lens carries NIKKOR ED branding, indicating that the design includes extra-low dispersion glass elements. The design also includes a built-in neutral density filter, just like the competition. Macro focusing is possible to just 0.8 inches. For photographers needing additional wide-angle reach, an optional WC-E75A Wide Angle Converter, shown at right, can be attached to the Nikon P7000 via a UR-E22 adapter ring, and the combination yields a generous 21mm-equivalent wide-angle."
