        "The world stopped in 1970 when Paul McCartney announced that he was through with the Beatles. His statement not only marked the end of the band's remarkable career, but also seemed to signal the demise of an era of unprecedented optimism in social history. Though the Beatles' breakup was widely viewed as a cultural tragedy, one of the most fascinating phases of their story was just about to begin.",

        "Doggett says the four Beatles’ individual efforts will never match the magic they created as a foursome. Yet the story of the post-breakup Beatles is intriguing and fascinating in its own right. Doggett begins at the end, with the 1980 murder of John Lennon outside the Dakota apartment building in New York, then turns back to the late-1960s, when Sgt. Pepper was released and the glow of the group’s innocent days had long dimmed. In that tumultuous time, the foundation of the band’s eventual demise several years later was laid. Doggett captures the competitive sparks that flew among the four men, especially between Lennon and Paul McCartney, and also the mutual affection that formed the basis of their complicated relationships. He covers all the many lawsuits and legal maneuverings that consumed so much of their time as well as the feelings of anger and betrayal and the weariness of it all. And he discusses each member’s solo albums. A must for Beatles fans and good for more casual pop-music enthusiasts, too. --June Sawyers",
        "Review",
        "“a gripping account that portrays [The Beatles] as something much more interesting than the airbrushed Gods we’ve recently seen: damaged, eternally bickering men, left punch-drunk by the group’s success” (The Guardian )“Doggett has crafted an authentic and enlightening book full of myth-busting surprises and insight.” (Library Journal )“What Doggett has achieved is a laying bare of the darker consequences of enormous fame and wealth. Yes, there is the glory but there’s also the concomitant pressure of how to deal with the myth and the legacy – while trying to keep four very different voices in harmony.” (Irish Times )“Fascinating…Doggett captures the competitive sparks that flew among the four men, especially between Lennon and Paul McCartney, and also the mutual affection that formed the basis of their complicated relationships…A must for Beatles fans and good for more casual pop-music enthusiasts, too.” (Booklist )“Peter Doggett’s book about the Beatles’ split is a real page-turner.” (Annie Lennox )“Doggett, a music journalist, offers refreshingly straightforward and highly readable portraits of the leading players” (Daily Telegraph (London) )“Elegant and deeply researched...You Never Give Me Your Money posits a nuanced afterlife for the Beatles. [Peter Doggett] has found a new lens (and much new information) through which to consider the band.” (Los Angeles Times )“Doggett’s book charts an admirably unstarry-eyed path through the break-up of the band and beyond.” (Metro London )“a breathtaking record of uncontrolled fame’s grotesque side-effects” (Q )“[Doggett’s] identification of the forces that drove The Beatles apart and kept them so for the best part of 30 years is not new, but his forensic tenacity and unyielding gaze are.” (Mojo )“an enthralling new book on [The Beatles]…impossible to put down” (The Independent )“I had such a ball reading You Never Give Me Your Money: The Beatles After the Breakup that once I finished, I returned to page one and read it all over again.” (Newsweek )“Doggett documents rock’s most agonizing four-way divorce. Rigorously researched, You Never Give Me Your Money is a dark but compelling endnote to rock’s greatest story.” (Rolling Stone )",

        "Forty years after their breakup, the Beatles are still on the radio. They're on television, in movies and video games. They're even in Cirque du Soleil. They're everywhere. Well, everywhere but iTunes. And there's a reason for that. Peter Doggett's \"You Never Give Me Your Money\" follows the Beatles after their breakup -- when the magic of the band and its music gave way to the day-to-day drudgery of managing the brand and its hopelessly tangled finances. In 1967, following the advice of their late manager Brian Epstein's brother, the Beatles incorporated in Britain under the name Apple Music Ltd (later renamed Apple Corps Ltd), mostly in an effort to escape the taxman. \"The financial benefits were obvious,\" Doggett writes. \"Their earnings were now subject to corporation tax rather than income tax (currently running 94 percent for such high earners as the Beatles), and they could claim back their personal living expenses from the company.\" But the Beatles also hoped that Apple Corps could be an extension of the idealism they sought to express in their music. Quickly expanded to include a publishing company, a record label, a boutique and an electronics laboratory, it would be a sanctuary for artists and innovators, a place where nobody had to beg. \"Instead of trying to amass money for the sake of it, we're setting up a business concern at Apple -- rather like . . . Western communism,\" explained Paul McCartney in 1968.Instead, it became a quagmire.Not long after Apple formed, the band's musical partnership began to fray, falling victim to creative differences, petty grudges and, of course, Yoko Ono. The business side wasn't going so well, either. Enormous sums were frittered away on unsupervised projects, including an ultimately useless state-of-the-art recording studio designed by John Lennon's friend \"Magic\" Alex Mardas. A warehouse worth of demos and manuscripts were solicited but never considered. Then there were the epic battles over Epstein's successor -- McCartney wanted his father-in-law, Lee Eastman, to oversee the group's fortunes, while his bandmates rallied behind record-industry shark Allen Klein. Unfortunately, the latter prevailed, creating a deep rift between McCartney and the other Beatles. When the group attempted to sever its relationship with Klein in the early '70s, the manager filed a barrage of lawsuits -- suing all four Beatles, Ono, Apple, nine of its subsidiary companies and one of the band's lawyers. When Klein finally settled in 1977, it was to the tune of more than $5 million. By the time the Beatles announced their breakup in 1969, Apple Corps had dissolved into a jumble of acronyms -- ABKCO, NEMS and EMI, to name a few. The lawsuits -- over ownership, royalty rates and trademarks -- went on for decades. Apple even sued Apple Computers over the rights to the name Apple. \"You Never Give Me Your Money\" diligently reconstructs the tedium, with every courtroom testimony and ill-tempered interview accounted for.  Call it the \"Magical Misery Tour\" -- a journey that is more engaging than you would think. When it comes to flower-power-deflating anecdotes, the book is a fair rival for the Manson family exposé \"Helter Skelter.\" Doggett portrays the post-breakup Beatles as self-absorbed, bratty and -- more than anything else -- confused. Too young to retire, they struggled to find meaningful ways to use their time, influence and bitterly contested fortune. Some were more enterprising than others: In 1971 George Harrison rallied a cadre of rock superstars -- including Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and a then-reclusive Bob Dylan -- for the \"Concert for Bangladesh,\" which resulted in two sold-out performances and a live album that generated millions for the war- and cyclone-ravaged nation. McCartney and Lennon were invited, but Doggett suggests that the pair could not rise above their egos. \"I said to George the reason I wouldn't do it was because it would mean that all the world's press would scream that the Beatles had got back together again, and I know that would have made Klein very happy,\" McCartney said, still bitter over Klein's hiring. \"I didn't really fancy playing anyway.\"But even in their least-inspirational moments, the Beatles still had flair. Doggett relates a McCartney anecdote from 1971, when the band convened at New York City's Plaza Hotel to terminate its legal partnership. Lennon -- apparently laid-up at an apartment just on the other side of Central Park -- refused to show. After repeated phone calls and more than a few expletives from his bandmates, he finally sent an emissary. \"He had a balloon delivered with a sign saying 'Listen to this balloon,' \" McCartney explained. \"It was all quite far out.\"Doggett delivers some less-than-flattering tales, but \"You Never Give Me Your Money\" is hardly lurid fare. He is too classy, too well-informed. And it's clear that he loves the Beatles. He regularly fantasizes about a separate timeline in which the band reconciled or, at the very least, buried the hatchet for one last jam session. That moment never came, but redemption did. \"The soul of the Beatles turned out to reside not in the boardroom of Apple Corps or the bank accounts of four multi-millionaires, but in the instinctive, natural grace of their songs,\" Doggett concludes. It's true. In the end, not even lawyers could ruin the Beatles. leitkoa@washpost.com Copyright 2010, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.",
