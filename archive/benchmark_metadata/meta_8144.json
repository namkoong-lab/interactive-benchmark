        "Jim Cymbala knows something a lot of us miss--that a comfortable, secure life won’t produce the satisfaction we long for. How could we feel fulfilled by missing out on the life God has for us? Whether life seems good or not right now, Jim Cymbala believes that God has more for you. In this new book, he’ll help you find out how to access the “more” God intends―more peace, real joy, and a deep sense of purpose. As you open yourself to the “more” of God, you will also discover your unique work assignment―the one thing God is calling you--and no one else--to accomplish for the sake of his work in the world. You Were Made for More draws a compelling picture of people just like you who are finding that “more of God” means more influence, more energy, and ultimately more happiness. It will help you picture what your own “land of milk and honey” might look like―the fuller, richer spiritual place you long to be. Using examples from the Bible, contemporary stories, and experiences from his own life, Jim Cymbala points the way to a richer, deeper life, helping you take hold of everything God wants to give."

The book is dotted with anecdotes of real people who overcame obstacles of poverty and drug addiction by a newfound commitment to Jesus; used their money and skills to support the church; or gave up the security of good jobs to serve others. As such, it will likely encourage some Christians facing life challenges. Although the associations often seem forced and the book's trajectory is unclear, Cymbala's use of biblical texts (particularly from Joshua, Judges and Ruth) serve their contemporary purpose. What the book lacks in unity, it makes up for in passion. Cymbala's confidence about defining the nature and wishes of God will not suit every reader, but his commitment to promoting generosity and well-being through the church yields gems of encouragement for people seeking stability and direction.",
