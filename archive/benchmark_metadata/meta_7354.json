        "Andrew Vachss returns with a mesmerizing novel about a hard-core thief who’s about to embark on a job that will alter his life forever.Sugar is that rarest of commodities: an old-school professional thief, tough and loyal as a pit bull, packing 255 pounds of muscle. When he’s picked out of a photo array in a vicious rape case, the cops find his apartment empty. A stakeout catches Sugar when he returns . . . carrying a loaded pistol. The sex-crime cops get nothing from their interrogation, but a streetwise detective figures out why Sugar offers no alibi: at the time of the rape, a holiday-weekend break-in job was being pulled at a jewelry store. The DA offers Sugar two options: give up his partners in the jewelry heist and walk, or plead to the rape he didn’t commit—and he’ll toss in the gun charge. For Sugar, that’s not two options; he takes the weight.  When Sugar finishes his time, his money is waiting for him, held by Solly, the mastermind behind the jewelry heist. But Solly tells Sugar that one of the heist crew was actually sent by another planner—and that planner has just died. In Sugar’s world, all loose threads must be cut. He suspects that there’s more to this job than what Solly is telling him. But nothing he suspects or imagines can prepare him for what he finds . . ."

        "that",
        "good. Otherwise, why go tag-team on me?  One of the cops on the second shift was an older guy. He looked the way some people say all cops used to: tall, big hands, straw-colored hair. Back then, they’d say, cops would catch a kid doing something wrong, they’d kick him in the ass, send him home, and go back to walking their beat. They never paid for a meal, but nobody thought that was graft. Some might even take money from bookies or whorehouses. But",
        "never",
        "from a dope dealer.  Maybe cops were really like that once. I don’t know; I wasn’t around then. I only know how they are now.  I’ll say this for the older cop: He dressed like a guy who lived on his paycheck. And he wasn’t there to dance. He walked in with his partner, sat down, and threw his Sunday punch: “This one just doesn’t look like your line of work, Sugar.”  That told me he was sharp enough to do more than just check me for priors. Not by calling me “Sugar.” The first pair, they’d called me that, too. Sliding it out of their mouths like they knew something dirty about me. This cop, he just said it like it was my name.  The first two cops, I think all they did was scan my record for a “Registered Sex Offender” ticket. When they didn’t see one, they were out of gas; it’s the only card they know how to play.  The older cop shook his head, like he was confused about what they’d arrested me for.  “I got to say, I don’t like you for this one at all.”  “Then what am I here for?” I asked him.  He made his eyes go sad, showing he was disappointed in me. It was a good trick. A guy who’s been around as long as him, he prob­ably knew a lot of them.  We’d already been sitting in the interrogation room for a couple of hours when he did that. Maybe it was part of his act, I don’t know. But it was as clear as if somebody wrote the rules on the wall for us all to see: As long as I didn’t say the magic words, we were going to play it like men. No disrespect, not in either direction.  Those magic words could only come out of my mouth. Door Number One: “I want a lawyer.” Door Number Two: “Yeah, you got me.”  I tell them I want a lawyer, they’d give me a look like I’d just screwed myself, cuff me back up, and have one of the bluecoats walk me into a holding cell.  But if I started talking, they’d hold off until they squeezed as much juice out of the lemon as they could. Say I told them I wanted a deal. They’d tell me that I could get damn near whatever I wanted . . . depending on what I had to trade.  The way they were working me, walking so soft, that was just to stop me from asking for a lawyer. Good cops—I don’t mean like they were good",
        "guys,",
        "just good at their job—they think the same way we do. They know if you get all impatient you can mess every­thing up.  So they stayed decent and respectful, like I said. Not kissing my ass or anything; making it just three men, talking. The way they’d figure it, so long as they could",

And I knew it was even worse odds against me convincing them they’d grabbed the wrong guy.  A weak hand, sure. Who hits a gutshot straight-flush draw? But I wasn’t drawing dead, not yet.  We each had our reasons for staying with it. They had all the time in the world. And that’s how much time I was looking at.  So I had to stay to see the last card drop. Because, no matter what those sex-crimes clowns had told me, I knew this couldn’t really be about a rape.  The rape they kept asking me about, it must have been a bad one. For the cops, the worst one would be if it happened to some kind of famous person. I hadn’t seen a paper for days, but I knew they’d been sitting on my place, waiting for me to come back. At least six of them, round the clock. That’s a lot of cops.  I didn’t know how long they’d been waiting, but they couldn’t have started until after I left, and that was only a few days ago.  Sending the sex-crimes cops in first, that didn’t mean anything—it could just be a hype to get me to take my eye off the ball.

        "magic words. Door One: one of the other guys had turned canary, put all the weight on me, trying to cut himself a deal. Door Two: here was my chance to help myself before it was too late.  Only the second pair of cops would try a move like that. The first two, the sex-crimes boys, they mostly made speeches. Or asked me stupid questions, like a TV camera was filming them. Big guy like me, all those muscles—what happened? I’d been on steroids so long I couldn’t get it up, and she’d laughed at me? I hadn’t meant to hurt her, just slap her around a little, maybe? Come on, isn’t that how it went down?  I yawned in their faces.  “Got nothing to say",

        "At the start of this tepid stand-alone from Vachss (Haiku), professional thief Tim \"Sugar\" Caine finds himself in an interesting dilemma--a rape victim has mistakenly identified him as her attacker, but he hesitates to tell the cops the truth because he was participating in a jewel robbery at the time. The canny ex-con figures that if he does time for the sex crime, he will evade scrutiny for the crime he did commit. Caine ends up serving a five-year sentence for sexual assault before he's back on the New York City streets, where he reconnects with Solly Vizner, the man who put the jewel heist together. Most of the book concerns Caine's efforts to track down another member of the crew who Vizner fears could squeal on everyone else, but a less than exciting lead and a slow-moving plot make this one of Vachss's weaker crime novels.

        "Sugar Caine is a thief. When he’s pinched after a job, he’s offered a deal: roll over on his partners or take the fall for a rape he didn’t commit. Caine takes the weight for the rape, knowing his life will never be the same. When he gets out, his share for the job is waiting for him, but it won’t last forever. Solly, the mastermind behind the job, wants Caine to tie up some loose ends concerning a recently deceased planner who Solly thinks may have left behind evidence tying them to the case. Caine heads to Florida where he connects with the planner’s widow, a trophy wife whose motives Caine can’t pin down. Tying up the loose ends may take Caine places he thought he’d never visit. Vachss’ work is usually unrelentingly dark and set in the shadow worlds of sex predators and the homeless. The tone may be a bit lighter this time, but Vachss still creates a world that readers won’t really want to experience except on the page. It’s just too damn scary. Vachss’ fans will not be disappointed. --Wes Lukowsky",
