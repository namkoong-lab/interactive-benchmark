        "The rustic (yet surprisingly sophisticated) design elements presented here make this an inspiring resource for cabin owners who desire more than \"cookie-cutter\" décor ideas for their lakeside or mountain home. Hundreds of vintage decorating ideas are pictured within fifteen chapters that reflect a once ordinary cabin as a timeless and relaxing showplace with personality and style. Chapters feature dishes, pottery, glassware, camp blankets, souvenirs, furniture, and ephemera that provide interesting accents for any vacation or weekend getaway. In addition, vintage sports, fishing, hunting, camping, and picnicking collectibles are also presented, as well as a special chapter on the Western look. Over 500 beautiful color photographs feature vintage cabin collectibles from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Companies whose products are shown include Old Hickory Furniture Co., Coleman Company, Inc., Rocky Mountain Pottery Co., Beacon Blankets, Buffalo Pottery, Evinrude, Stickley Bros., and many more. Current values as well as an extensive resources section and bibliography make this the most complete cabin collectible book of its kind."
