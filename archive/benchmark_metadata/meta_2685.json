        "Sunpar's Words were originally presented online on the World Wide Web. I now present them to you with additional emphasis on clarity, which will in some instances have changed the original Words, however will have not changed the conceptual presentation. This is Volume 1 of this collection.Sunpar’s Words covers the gamut of body, mind and spirit and some silliness in between. The short essays and stories cover one’s ability to experience what Abraham Maslow described in his hierarchy of human needs as peak performances, allowing the ongoing movement into self-actualization or ones intimate authentic being. While sharing the continuances of many familiar thought processes, delving ever deeper into levels of comprehension, it is realized that these words are not set in stone and that one must be responsible in receiving what is right for them in the moment. Always, self-responsibility is the intimate responsibility of the individual. These words are shared with this intent."
