        "Jon Fuller’s fascination with rivers began in early his childhood, when he spent his free time exploring the small creeks and ponds near in his home in rural upstate New York, trying to float the rafts he built from scrap lumber and logs. He paddled his first real canoe at age five, 19-foot aluminum keeled canoe. At twelve he took his first multi-day, unsupervised canoe trip on the Fulton Chain of Lakes, followed by overnight trips on the Tioghnioga River a year later. Jon’s love of rivers eventually took him to graduate school in Tucson, Arizona to study the geology and flood hydrology of arid-region streams. There, the subtle magic of rivers in the desert captured him, and he made the Southwest his home. Over his 36-year career as a geomorphologist and hydrologist, he worked on hundreds of rivers throughout the western United States. Now semi-retired, he spends his time exploring, running rivers, writing, and hiking with his amazing wife Kate. Gila River Elegy is the second in Jon’s river elegy series. It tells the story of Jon’s epic 650-mile paddling and pedaling journey down the entire Gila River, from its headwaters at the Continental Divide in New Mexico, through the Gila Wilderness, and across Arizona to the river’s mouth at Yuma, Arizona. Jon’s journey is the longest known solo canoe trip on the Gila, and the longest boat trip of any kind on the Gila since 1891. Gila River Elegy is equal parts exciting adventure tale, fascinating narratives of the river’s rich history, and insightful observations about the historical and on-going land and water management practices that made the Gila River America’s Most Endangered River in 2019. Jon’s writing is at times humorous, always reflective, and ultimately poignant, as he witnesses the life and death of one of the great rivers of the American Southwest."

        "About the Author",
        "Jon Fuller's fascination with rivers began in early childhood, spending hours floating sticks in a creek and pretending they were boats. He paddled his first real boat at age five. At age twelve he took his first multi-day, unsupervised canoe trip. Jon's love of rivers took him to graduate school in Arizona, where he studied the flood histories of the Salt and Verde rivers. There, the subtle magic of rivers in the desert captured him, and he made Arizona his home. Over his 34-year career as a well-known hydrologist and geomorphologist, he authored hundreds of reports about rivers throughout the West. This is his second book, following on from Verde River Elegy.",

        "Review",
        "As he did for the Verde River, Fuller delivers equal parts guidebook, instruction, and historical backdrop wrapped in a gritty personal river saga of source-to-mouth authenticity. In the end, this is an environmental love story, both inspiring and heartbreaking, the sort of tale we ignore at our peril. --Alan Kesselheim, Senior Editor for Canoe & Kayak Magazine and author of Let Them Paddle: Coming of Age on the Water.In Gila River Elegy, Jon Fuller delivers a tapestry of observations, experiences, and intention from the cockpit of his trusty canoe, Blue. Fuller explores the history, threats, and wonder of one of the Southwest s most iconic and romantic river adventures but also one of the most endangered. The Gila River is literally in the bullseye of a variety of threats overdevelopment from dams and diversions, historic overuse as the river threads its way from the Arizona border to its eventual disappearance before it reaches the confluence with the Colorado, and the looming impacts of climate change. Throughout the narrative of his journey, Fuller adds a color and thoughtfulness to his exploration of one of America s last, best, wild places. --Sinjin Eberle/American RiversImagination and persistence with a dash of crazy make up the recipe for this Gila adventure. Fold in the deep perception of the adventurer and you have something special. Jon has experienced the Gila River like no one has. We are richer for having a historical and modern chronicle of the river but poorer for learning how much we ve lost. Jon strongly makes the case for protecting the wild parts of the Gila and sows the seed of a vision for the resurrection of the river reaches that didn t survive. By the way Jon, you are welcome at camp anytime. --Todd Schulke/Co-Founder of the Center for Biological Diversity",
