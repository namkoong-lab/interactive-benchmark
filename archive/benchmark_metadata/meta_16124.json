If this is the first time ordering our jerseys and you are not quite sure as to what Euro-cut means, we encourage you to review our sizing chart as a reference tool, which will help you determine the appropriate size for you.Our famous Club-cut offers a comfortable and anatomic fit to the rider.Our cycling jerseys are meant to have a tight fit. If you are a casual rider and prefer wearing a less tighter jersey, we recommend you to order the next larger size. For example, if you normally wear a Large size shirt, then you should order a size XL instead."
