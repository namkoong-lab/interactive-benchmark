        "Radio advertising salesperson Lee Easton is on the edge, struggling to survive as he loses sale after sale. With a growing family to feed and fewer and fewer prospects on the horizon, Lee is reduced to begging clients to buy something, anything to save his job. After getting one final rejection during an out-of-town trip, Lee is forced to drive back to his home in Minneapolis in a blinding snowstorm. The blizzard worsens, and to avoid being stopped by police who’ve closed the highway, Lee takes to the gravel back roads in a small town. Though he avoids the police, he slides off a bridge and wrecks his car. Exposed in an open field and near death, Lee stumbles onto a remote lodge where he finds an old man who, after hearing Lee’s story, shares with him a secret he’s held for nearly thirty years—he has three pairs of magical glasses that, when worn, dramatically change the way one experiences the world. The only thing the old man asks in return is that Lee will share his story with the world. After wearing the first pair for just a few days, Lee is shocked at how powerful this new vision is. He sees an entirely new reality and soon discovers that he alone has been the creator of all his misery, and he alone has the power to change everything immediately. Where once he only saw failure, he now can only see success. Lee’s life changes in every way, and through the publication of this book, he’s kept his promise to share his story with the world. Read how your life can also be changed by what Lee saw through the glasses. Look! See! Understand! Change your world forever!"
