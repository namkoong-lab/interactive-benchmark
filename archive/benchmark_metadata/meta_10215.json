        "Longtime Wu-Tang affilate Killah Priest along with Army of The Pharaohs core member Chief Kamachi have teamed up to release a full length collabo album entitled \"Beautiful Minds\" on Good Hands Records. Both rappers are considered two of the top poetry writing MC's in the game, and by joining forces Priest and Kamachi plan to deliver an album that fans of lyricism will love. \"Kamachi and I are alike in a lot of ways, and this album is going to turn a lot of heads\", says Priest. Kamachi responds with \"Working with Priest was like going to the studio with myself. It was second nature working with him. It all just came so naturally.\" The album features only one track with guest appearances, a rarity these days. West coast mainstays Planet Asia and DJ Rhettmatic lend a hand on the track \"Illest.\" Production on \"Beautiful Minds\" is handled by Tekneek (Kurupt, Tha Dogg Pound), E. Dan (Reef The Lost Cauze, Kamachi, Wiz Khalifa), C Sik (Dilated Peoples, Strong Arm Steady), Dev Rocka, Diamond Legit, Emonex and more. After Killah Priest's recent success with albums \"The Offering\" and \"Behind the Stained Glass\" combined with the success of the latest Army of The Pharaohs album called \"Ritual Of Battle\" from 2007, which scanned well over 20k, this release is destined to be on every top ten independant Hip Hop list for 2008."
