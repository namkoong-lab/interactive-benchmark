        "The Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest Classic Foam Sleeping Pad is, as its name suggests, the classic camping mattress, trusted by generations of campers and backpackers for a good night’s sleep in the great outdoors. The basic closed-cell foam design provides a ground pad option that is not only lightweight and durable, but also a great value. It rolls up compactly to fit in or strap to a backpack, and is light enough to carry almost anywhere. The foam padding is designed with supportive peaks for comfort, and heat-trapping valleys for insulation, ensuring support and warmth all night. With an R-Value of 2.0 (R-value measures the material’s ability to insulate; the higher the R-value, the warmer the sleeping pad), it’s ideal for sleeping outside in spring, summer, and fall. It also makes an excellent insulating layer, when used in combination with another Therm-a-Rest sleeping pad, for winter and snow camping. Virtually indestructible, the cross-linked polyethylene material provides protection from rocks, roots, and sharp sleeping surfaces, and ensures durability for years of use. The Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest Classic Foam Sleeping Pad is available in three sizes: Small measures 47 x 20 inches (20 x 6.5 inches rolled) and weighs 9 ounces, Regular measures 72 x 20 inches (20 x 8 inches rolled) and weighs 14 ounces, and Large measures 77 x 25 inches (25 x 8.5 inches rolled) and weighs 19 ounces. Made in the USA."
