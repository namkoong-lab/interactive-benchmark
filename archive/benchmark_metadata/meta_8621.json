        "Lauded for her eloquence, observation, and wry humor, Jane Austen was a novelist who was highly regarded and greatly celebrated in her own time. However, her appeal is as great as ever, and her insights remain as fresh and relevant today as when they were first published. This delightful volume offers thematic extracts from fiction and correspondence, featuring quotes from such novels as",
        "Emma",
        ",",
        "Northanger Abbey",
        ",",
        "Pride and Prejudice",
        ",",
        "Mansfield Park",
        ", and",
        "Persuasion",
        ", alongside extracts from Austen's letters to her sister and confidante, Cassandra. Containing a host of quotations displaying Austen's sharp—indeed, often wicked—wit, this wonderful treasury will be enjoyed by fans of the author as well as readers who are new to her writing."
