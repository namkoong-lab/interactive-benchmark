        "Administration of Wills, Trusts, and Estates, fourth edition, has proven to be a highly successful text for paralegal students, marrying dense content with a reader friendly style that utilizes extensive examples. The use of celebrity wills and estates as illustrations provides access for students into complicated legal topics. Legal vocabulary is defined immediately for students. This new version has more case studies so that students become more familiar with the legal process and have real examples of how legal concepts are applied by courts. The text narrative material is national in scope, with charts and graphs that focus on state-by-state information. The text balances narrative material and visual presentations to accommodate a variety of student learning styles. Students have extensive and varied practice materials at the end of each chapter so that the text material can be re-enforced and expanded. The material in this revision has been updated to include the current state of the law."
