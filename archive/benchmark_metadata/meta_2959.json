        "I responded readily to Janet’s book because it is so friendly, simple to follow, attractive to the eye, well researched and has a very personal touch. It’s like sitting down with her and, over a cup of coffee and a plate of hot out of the oven scones, having her share all of these wonderful experiences. Her passion for cheese is evident.",

        "Hurst, who's been making cheese at home for over 20 years, adds to a wave of recent books that address cheese making at home, part of a bigger trend linking learning and appreciation for the craft of food with budgeting. She provides a good selection of achievable recipes, such as for chèvre and halloumi, which further benefit from the many handsome illustrations. The distribution of some important information to later chapters and placement of profiles of cheese makers in the middle of explanatory sections undermine the instructional function of the book and break the flow. Verdict Compared to other titles like Jody Farnham and Marc Druart's The Joy of Cheesemaking, this guide is not as rigorous and places less emphasis on the science behind making cheese at home. Purchase only where cheese making is popular.",

Frequent trips to her great grandmother\\'s farm are treasured memories for Janet. Those special moments of collecting eggs, getting water from a well, and finding new born kittens in a hayloft inspired her to own her own small farm, which had to include a few goats. From the moment she brought the first one home, she was hooked and has been making cheese, spinning, and weaving for over 25 years.']}"
