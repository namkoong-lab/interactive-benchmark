        "THE DELICATE SKIN around the eyes requires GENTLE, PROTECTIVE ingredients – but even high-end eye creams are often full of HARSH CHEMICALS that can cause BURNING & REDNESS. At Vitavelle, we formulated our Cooling Eye Serum with PURE, VEGAN EXTRACTS that are both naturally SOOTHING and deeply hydrating, with absolutely ZERO PARABENS or irritating chemicals. So you can look forward to CALMING, NOURISHING HYDRATION – without the mysterious, unpronounceable ingredients list.",
        "DESPITE THEIR CLAIMS, many anti aging eye cream formulas end up drying out the eye area, AGGRAVATING SKIN and creating a perfect environment for NEW WRINKLES TO FORM. Our hydrating eye cream for wrinkles was developed with a curated blend of gentle ingredients that INFUSE THE SKIN with MOISTURE & PROTECTION. While FENNEL EXTRACT calms, depuffs, and boosts circulation, OAK ROOT forms a protective layer to prevent skin from dehydration, and EYEBRIGHT HERB combats sun damage.",
        "ANTIOXIDANT-RICH NOURISHMENT – Packed with ANTI-AGING BENEFITS, Fennel Extract penetrates the DEEPEST LAYERS of the skin to NEUTRALIZE radicals from sun damage and protect against aging. By improving circulation around the eyes, our eye moisturizer ’s pure Fennel Extract may also help ALLEVIATE and PREVENT DARK CIRCLES. Rich in Zinc, Fennel also helps nourish and maintain the SKIN’S STRUCTURE, helping your complexion maintain a fresh, youthful look.",
        "ZERO CRUELTY – and 100% TRANSPARENCY. Made in Germany in a no-cruelty facility, our eye serum for dark circles and puffiness contains NO PARABENS, HARSH CHEMICALS, or IRRITATING MINERAL OILS. Delivered in a darkened glass pump bottle for UV PROTECTION, this eye puffiness reducer and under eye cream for dark circles is packaged for LONG-LASTING USE.",
        "AT VITAVELLE, WE’RE PASSIONATE about developing facial skin care products that combine THE PUREST INGREDIENTS with the most ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC METHODS. We believe the best, MOST DEEPLY BENEFICIAL ingredients are those that come straight from nature. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY – if you don’t love your eye serum anti aging wrinkles smoother, we’re here to help in any way we can."
