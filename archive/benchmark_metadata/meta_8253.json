The Dream Detective Series is based on the dreams and intuition of Abigail Morrison, self-made psychic detective solving the mysteries of the victims that she meets in dreamland.",
        "If you're into numerology, then you'll pick up on the 21 connections right away. There's 21 chapters and 21 is a symbolic thread and common ground among many of the spirits who Abigail Morrison has helped.Up until this spring, I have never flown back into time and space in some sort of telepathic dream machine to catch a glimpse of this woman, because I am certain that I did not know her in this lifetime, and our paths have never crossed. You see, I am certain this woman is dead, and I have been transported to the year 1983. My name is Abigail Morrison, and when I tell my story to others many times the first reaction is to gasp, but mostly they want to know how I survived. My house was beginning to scare the hell out of me from all of the spirit activity, yet I cannot leave when I'm convinced my house won't let me. The words the stranger in the library blurted out to me were true, \"Someone is trying to get my attention,” and her knowing something about my house is creepier than the spirit trying to attack me, and I wonder if the word is out in town that I'm onto something? The thought of my house having up to ten spirits caught me off guard. Having the wind knocked out of me last night also caught me by complete surprise. I felt it enter, but I didn't feel it leave. I can't get the gun out of my head, or maybe I should say the lack of gun. The digital clock above the bar read 7:00 p.m. I knew it was time for me, and the spirit posing as me to leave the smoke-filled tavern. It's hard to say how I feel about everything, my ribs ache and I find myself looking for an attorney. Never, in a million years did I think this would happen to me. It was 2002, when I began to dream of the drug dealer's wife found dead on the railroad tracks, except her dream told me something else. Although, Connects is fiction it is based on true events and how Abigail Morrison interpreted her dreams, premonitions, the paper trail, and the chatter from the town folk on what could have happened Memorial Weekend in 1983."

It's funny, because it seems those that don't understand the book seem to believe that the parts that are true as true can be are all made up. When the only portion of the book that is made up are the names, places and dates. The story is real. All real. Like I said, sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. And in this case 'Connects' is a prime example how bizarre meets reality.",

        "As a writer, I may not be the most prolific writer using big fluffy words that perhaps us common folk have never seen before, but what I do bring to the desk is truth. There are many times when I wear my heart on my sleeve and write one heck of a story. I draw from reality, and fiction to create the perfect blended stories that will make you scratch your head in disbelief. Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. Truthfully, I find it difficult to write about myself, but I guess in a nutshell I'm a tree hugger who also loves animals, especially cats. Currently, I have too many cats to count, and considering on starting a nonprofit for the furry felines, since I rescue all that will let me. I guess you could even say that I'm that cat lady who likes to wear hats. 'Kat's in the Hat' was a bit silly so I decided to write it as a tagline. Even as an adult I'm not too old to enjoy Dr. Seuss, because this series is one of my all time favorites. Over the years, I've read books from fictional characters that come to life, real crime stories, and even haunted tales. Some of my favorites are Lovely Bones and the Flowers in the Attic Series. Self-help books is what I read the absolutely most of, as my goal is to continue to evolve into the best person that I can be, and I believe in doing this by talking to God on a daily basis. Just as though I would talk to my friend on the phone. Divine Intuition is one of my favorites by Lynne Robinson and everything that Sonia Choquette writes has grabbed my attention. Which is why I have begun to plunk out a few of my own, now that I feel my life's experiences have some nuggets of wisdom to share with others. Depression grabbed me and almost wouldn't let go a few years ago, which is why I wrote,'Get Out of the Depression Pit'. And now I want to help others dig themselves out of the pit and into a life of happiness and fulfillment.",

Kat's in the Hat. I adore hats and usually will be wearing one while giving book readings and signings. Writing is something that I've always done as a little girl, but later in life writing became my lifeline. I had lost so much but not in the traditional way most would think someone of a life of abuse would lose herself. No, sometimes life throws us into a living hell or nightmare. Connects is book one in the Dream Detective Series, and it's just the beginning of the nightmare. The second book is being written now in real time, and it's a shocker! I know no one will be expecting this twisted tale with the Hollow Man. Originally, I thought of calling this book Whisper's in the Dark, but I realized the more fitting title is the name I've been calling him for years, Hollow Man. It's bizarre but those that know me, I often say that the truth is stranger than fiction. And in my life, it's been just that and more. How do I cope? Or how have I coped? I write another lighter series: Body Mind and Soul in which I help others and myself to stay positive and upbeat no matter what life throws at them. www.katsinthehat.com\"]}"
