        "Review",
        "“This is iron-sharpening-iron work that must be at the core of the best leader’s character and decisions. John pushes us all to do it right, and this book gives us the tools to get there.”",
        "Dr. Roger Parrott,",
        "President, Belhaven University",
        "“We are all being led or leading all the time and both sides have great responsibility. John digs deeply into the ethical sides of decision making. The book is laced with interesting and powerful stories about how others have met moral dilemmas, some do what is right and others don’t. It has very little to do with who is a “good person”. Doing what is right seems so obvious; many of us never give any thought to it. We should. If everyone read this book, the world would be a better place. This book should be required reading for everyone.”",
        "Michael L .F. Slavin, author,",
        "One Million in the Bank,",
        "CEO, U. S. Emerald Energy Company",
        "“Many books simply theorize and proselytize about ethics in business. Not so with this exceptional account of the real life experiences of top level executives who succeeded and failed in the arena of ethical intelligence and decision making. The stories in this book provide a much-needed wake-up call for all of us. Read it now.”",
        "Michael J. Vandermark, Ph.D.,",
        "Consulting Corporate Psychologist",
        "\"Dr. Opincar’s book is a roadmap for creating an ethically intelligent life-experience, and it is a recipe for success. This is a great book. It should be required reading for everyone.”",
        "Eric Idehen, Founder and CEO,",
        "Cornerstone of Hope Orphanages,",
        "Benin City, Nigeria and Pujehun, Sierra Leone",
        "“This book on Ethical Intelligence comes at a time in our country when leaders, organizations, and communities are mired in increasing ethical dilemmas. Dr. Opincar, skillfully created a book that combines research, history, storytelling, and his personal experiences to deepen the readers understanding of the key concepts and framework. The list of questions at the end of each chapter, offers the readers valuable opportunity to reflect on their current beliefs and practices.
