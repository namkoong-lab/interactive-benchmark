    "description": [
        "The W·H·Y Trap has two chambers and three attractants to catch 19 different species of insects. The top chamber is baited with two attractants—one of which is a solid contained in a vial, and the other a liquid mixed with water. The bottom chamber is baited with a liquid attractant poured onto a cotton pad. Wasps, hornets and yellowjackets have two ways to enter: either through the top cap, or through the holes in the bottom cap. Double-chambered design restricts insects from escaping. Durable construction holds up for multiple seasons of use. Catches workers from summer through fall, and catches queens in spring before they build nests. Catches paper wasps, bald-faced hornets, and European hornets. No bug identification necessary!"
