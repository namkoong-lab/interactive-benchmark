        "Karen Voight - Cardio Strength Circuit Training Karen Voight I clicked on Karen's website the other day and surprised that this video was ready since it was set for a December release. Since it was available, and you can order online, I just had to go ahead and try it. To give you some background, I am 43 and an intermediate exerciser that uses mostly Firms and Cathe videos along with some of Karen's. This tape starts with an active warm-up and stretch done by Karen and two background exercisers. The video does require a step and two sets of weights- a \"light\" and \"heavy\" set. I used 5 and 10lbs, although I may experiment a little more with some heavier weights. After the warm up, Karen takes you through a cardio segment lasting a little over 9 mins. The choreography for this section is pretty easy to follow if you are experienced with step, but it is fast paced. After this section you move into a \"heavy\" weight training session working both upper and lower body. This segment includes: squats, lat rows, bicep curls with calf raises, dead lifts, push ups, pec flys and triceps. The movement for the most part, is slow and controlled and includes some work in the mid range, keeping the muscles contracted the entire time on the dead lifts and pec flys. Then the next cardio session, lasting almost 7 mins begins. This is followed by a \"lighter\" weight session with weights. This time, you get triceps and biceps in a combo move, some lunges using the step, rhomboids(sp) and a shoulder segment where you combine rear delt lifts, lateral lifts, front lifts and an overhead press. That shoulder combo IMO is a killer. Finally, you move into another cardio segment lasting about 7 1/2 mins. Karen then takes you to the floor for ab work on an incline step. The segment isn't super long, but abs are one of the things Karen does best and this segment is no exception. It is different and tough. Karen then finishes with some work for your glutes and thighs. You lie face down on you"
