        "Love isn’t real. It’s just a biochemical reaction. Right?",
        "That’s what I’ve always believed. All my friends falling in love with these gorgeous golden alien pirates?I’m convinced they’re just experiencing biological impulses.I mean, I get it. I watch Zander stride through the hallways to me and my heart skips a beat. I see him lean over to speak to me and my knees weaken. When he touches me?It’s like a supernova… down there.I want to be with him. To laugh with him. Satisfy him. Stay with him. Who knows how long we have in this galaxy? Our enemies are still as determined as ever.I want my time with the deliciously muscular alien to count. Except that means I was wrong about love.It isn’t just physical. Not just chemicals. It feels so true in my mind, body, and soul.But that’s not science… I don’t know if I can trust that. True love can’t be real.",
