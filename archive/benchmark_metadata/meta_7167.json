        "You’re a boy who likes pink? Great! You like to play with dolls? Fantastic! Your best friend is a girl—and she likes to crash cars, build things, and play pirates? Awesome! Playing is about having fun, exploring and learning about the bigger world! Forget about what toys are for girls and what toys are for boys. How else would a boy decide he wants to be a chef one day? How else might a girl get the idea that she too could be a fire fighter? We are all different and like different things. What matters is that we are happy and confident. Funny and reassuring, Pink is Just a Color and so is Blue is sure to educate and entertain boys and girls alike. Inspired by the vision of a world where children feel free to explore and be themselves, Pink is Just a Color and So Is Blue is fresh take on freedom of personal expression. It is a sweet, gentle lesson about acceptance, tolerance, and having confidence in who you are. The world defined by pink and blue is becoming out-dated, and Bhatia’s humorous story teaches young readers that they should be free to choose what they like without someone dictating what it should be. Pink is Just a Color and So Is Blue will have you laughing, and reminding you of the joy of life’s possibilities, while it teaching your children about the importance of being themselves. To further enrich their reading experience, the author includes discussion questions and activities for parents and teachers."
