        "LEA Network’s BoxPower30 PoE unit can save time and money by utilizing existing ethernet cabling to delivery data and power to network equipment compliant to 802.3af (PoE) or 802.3at (PoE+). To power non-PoE equipment, utilize an off-the-shelf PoE power splitter.",
        "Make difficult to power remote equipment installations simple, using one Cat5e ethernet cable to delivery data and power.",
        "High quality, carrier grade PoE injector simply and safely powers network equipment such as IP cameras, wireless access points, LED connected lighting, IP phones, or LTE/WiFi antennas.",
        "Easy plug and play installation, with wall or outlet mount security fastener, and ethernet cord cable tie points. Secures the unit and cabling to prevent accidental disconnection.",
        "Connects to any existing router port or remote jack to power remote network equipment. Avoid investing in multi-port solutions requiring long cable runs, wasting DC power. Plugging the injector close to the remote equipment maximizes power delivery.",
        "Auto-detection handshake protects accidental connection to non-PoE equipment, preventing any equipment damage.",
        "Part of LEA Networks whole home and business networking solutions system. Designed and developed in France and the USA. UL Listed for safety and performance assurance."
