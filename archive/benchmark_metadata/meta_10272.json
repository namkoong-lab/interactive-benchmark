        "Nominated for 10 Academy Awards and winner of five, including Best Picture and Best Director, the iconic film adaptation of Rodgers & Hammerstein's The Sound Of Music stands as the most successful movie musical of all time, enjoying a seven-year run as the highest-grossing film of all time from 1966 to 1972 and remaining a consistent favorite through worldwide television broadcasts and home video releases. In 2001, the film was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry. The film's Grammy nominated, multi-platinum soundtrack, featuring the beautiful vocals of Julie Andrews, has sold more than 10 million units worldwide. The unforgettable songs, including \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Do-Re-Mi,\" \"Sixteen Going On Seventeen,\" \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" and more, have become unquestionable staples of popular music, having been covered, referenced and even sampled many times over the past half century. As part of an extensive 50th anniversary campaign in 2015, The Sound Of Music's original 16-track soundtrack will be reissued on 180-Gram Vinyl. The soundtrack has been remastered from the original analog tapes and includes the eight-page booklet that accompanied the original vinyl release."
