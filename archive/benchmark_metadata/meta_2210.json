He thought he'd failed Jonah as his Dom, and it took everything he had not to throw away his sobriety, too. Three years later, he's finally found peace, a new job, and is trying to move on. That's when his big break comes along--a chance to play with one of the most famous rock stars ever. Except it also means playing with Jonah. Jonah realized too late that the worst mistake of his life was leaving Gordon. Make that second-worst. His worst mistake was trusting the wrong person and breaking Gordon's heart with cruel words he wishes he could erase. When the chance of a lifetime falls in his lap, he's willing to throw it away if it means he can win Gordon back. Jonah wants another chance to prove himself. Does Gordon dare risk his trust, his heart--and their biggest career opportunity ever--and let his boy back in?",
