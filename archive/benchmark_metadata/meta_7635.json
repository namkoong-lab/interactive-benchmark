        "\"We are swinging high flying way up, higher than in real life.And when I look down, I see all the ordinary stuff -- our brick house, the porch the tool shed, the oil drum barbecue pit, the clothesline, the chinaberry tree.But they are all lit up from inside so their everyday selves have holy sparks in them, and if only people could see those sparks, they'd go and kneel in front of them and pray and just feel good. Somehow the whole world looks like little altars everywhere.\"",
        "Little Altars Everywhere",
        "is a national best-seller, a companion to Rebecca Wells's celebrated novel",
        "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.",
        "Originally published in 1992,",
        "Little Altars",
        "introduces Sidda, Vivi, the rest of the spirited walker clan, and the indomitable Ya-Yas. It is now available for the first time in hardcover.",
        "Told in alternating voices of Vivi and her husband, Big Shep, along with Sidda, her siblings Little Shep, Lulu, Baylor, and Cheney and Willetta--the black couple who impact the Walkers' lives in ways they never fully comprehend--",
        "Little Altars",
        "embraces nearly thirty years of life on the plantation in Thorton, Louisiana, where the cloying air of the bayou and a web of family secrets at once shelter, trap and define an utterly original community of souls.",
        "Who can resist such cadences of Sidda Walker and her flamboyant, secretive mother, ViVi? Here the young Sidda -- a precocious reader and an eloquent observer of the fault lines that divide her family -- leads us on a mischievous adventures at Our Lady of Divine Compassion parochial school and beyond. A Catholic girl of pristine manners, devotion, and provocative ideas, Sidda is the very essence of childhood sorrow and joy and sorrow.",
        "In a series of Luminous reminiscences, we also hear Little Shep's stories of his eccentric grandmother, Lulu's matter-of-fact account of her shoplifting skills, and Baylor's memories of Vivi and her friends, the Ya-Yas.",
        "Beneath the humor and tight-knit bonds of family and friendship lie the undercurrents of alcoholism, abuse, and violence. The overlapping recollections of how the Walkers' charming life uncoils to convey their heart-breaking confusion are oat once unsettling and familiar. Wells creates an unforgettable portrait of the eccentric cast of characters and exposes their poignant and funny attempts to keep reality at arm's length. Through our laughter we feel their inevitable pain, with a glimmer of hope for forgiveness and healing.",
        "An arresting combination of colloquialism, poetry, and grace",
        "Little Altars Everywhere",
        "is an insightful, piercing and unflinching evocation of childhood, a loving tribute to the transformative power of faith, and thoroughly fresh chronicle of a family that is as haunted as it is blessed."

        "Denver Post",
        "\"Some writers have all the luck. Not only did Rebecca Wells get to be Catholic, she also got to come from Louisiana. This means that half of her is conversant with the Mystery, and the other half is crazy. Out of this chemistry she has written a brilliant, pungent, and hilarious novel about the Walker clan of Thornton, Louisiana...I'd like you to meet Miss Siddalee Walker, a force of nature and a tool of fate, and one of the sharpest-eyed little chatterboxes since Huckleberry Finn.",

        "Little Altars Everywhere",
        "is a book that stuns - aesthetically, emotionally, psychologically. At its core is Siddalee's dysfunctional Southern family. Now thirty-eight, Siddalee lives in New York and tries to understand a childhood dominated by her beautiful, dramatic mother, Viviane, who drank and then beat and sexually abused her children. Then there's her father, Big Shep, an alcoholic as well, a sensitive Louisiana farmer who can never quite say what he wants, unless it's to yell at his wife. Siddalee's siblings have their own problems, and Willetta and Chaney, the black \"help,\" have no power to save them. Chaney remarks: the \"Only thing my Letta done lost sleep over is those children ... You hand-wash a family's underthings and you learn more about them than you ever want to.\" All of them tell their stories, packing full lives into anecdotes and scenes told as adults or remembered as children. Rebecca Wells takes those stories, so filled with pain, and makes beauty. After Siddalee allows her long, red hair to be cut on a drunken day, she lies out on the grass: \"My heart starts pounding, my breath gets real tight, and I get all afraid. But I can feel the ground underneath me. And I tell myself: The earth is holding me up. I am lighter than I was before. My hair is like grass planted on the top of my head. If I can just wait long enough, maybe it will grow back in some other season.\"",
