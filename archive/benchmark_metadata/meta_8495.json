        "From the Author",
        "Puddin' Tain was my first step into writing a children's book. It has stayed \"on the back burner\" for almost twenty years while I went on to other writings and having published other books. It is inspired by a real pony named Puddin' Tain. She was one of my lesson ponies and loved by many of my riding students. Those students are grownup now, some with children of their own. I pulled this little book off the back burner so I could share it with them, and other young riders who have loved a special horse or pony.",
