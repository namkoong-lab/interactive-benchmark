        "In this challenging and often humorous book, Louis Owens examines issues of Indian identity and relationship to the environment as depicted in literature and film and as embodied in his own mixedblood roots in family and land. Powerful social and historical forces, he maintains, conspire to colonize literature and film by and about Native Americans into a safe \"Indian Territory\" that will contain and neutralize Indians. Countering this colonial \"Territory\" is what Owens defines as \"Frontier,\" a dynamic, uncontainable, multi-directional space within which cultures meet and even merge.",
        "Owens offers new insights into the works of Indian writers ranging from John Rollin Ridge, Mourning Dove, and D'Arcy McNickle to N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Silko, James Welch, and Gerald Vizenor. In his analysis of Indians in film he scrutinizes distortions of Indians as victims or vanishing Americans in a series of John Wayne movies and in the politically correct but false gestures of the more recent",

        "As Owens moves through his personal landscape in Oklahoma, Mississippi, California, and New Mexico, he questions how human beings collectively can alter their disastrous relationship with the natural world before they destroy it. He challenges all of us to articulate, through literature and other means, messages of personal and environmental — as well as cultural—survival, and to explore and share these messages by writing and reading across cultural boundaries."

        "An issue that is often debated is who gets to tell the stories for Native Americans? Only full-blooded, reservation-raised Indians, or anyone with Indian ancestry? In this collection of essays, Owens, a Choctaw-Cherokee-Irish literature professor at the Univ. of New Mexico, hammers on this and other topics of concern to Indians. Because of his mixed ancestry he has been accused of being an \"urban Indian\" and therefore not a credible social critic for Native America. Owens (Other Destinies: Understanding the American Indian Novel) disputes this, over and over, in every piece. He acknowledges that these essays constitute a book, but still repeats the same thoughts, and sentences, in nearly every essay, thereby stretching the reader's patience. The first section, \"Mixedbloods and Mixed Messages,\" is not only ponderous and pompous, but little more than veneration of author Gerald Vizenor masked as literary criticism. Owens's position here, while tediously quoting Vizenor, is that \"Euramericans\" have conspired to create a myth of Indigenous Americans as braided, buckskin-wearing, noble savages and that bestselling Native American writers are perpetuating the stereotype by buying into white expectations of \"real Indians.\" On rare occasions, in his autobiographical works especially, he rises from the quagmire of academic gobbledygook (\"the subsumption of Indian identity into the national metanarrative\") and the voice of a gifted writer emerges. So who gets to tell the First Americans' stories? Apparently even Indian authors do not know. Photos. Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "Native American writers have made an indisputable mark on the literary landscape of the late 20th century. Among those who stand out is Louis Owens (literature, Univ. of New Mexico; Bone Game, LJ 9/1/94). In this collection of well-crafted essays, Owens demonstrates how family, place, and mixed heritage have had an impact on contemporary literature. In doing so, he examines the contributions of Native writers ranging from the earliest known novelist, John Rollin Ridge, to contemporaries like Gerald Vizenor. He also considers the portrayal of Native Americans in film, highlighting John Wayne movies and Dances with Wolves. The essays, many of which first appeared elsewhere, are personalized with autobiographical experiences, evocatively demonstrating how one mixed-blood Native American ties the world together.

        "This essay collection provides an excellent introduction to Native American literature and experience but suffers from the self-indulgence and inconsistent analysis that plagues so much academic writing meant also for lay audiences. University of New Mexico literature professor Owens alternately argues that other races' outsider literature is and is not like Native Americans', and he never questions the relevance of the term \"mixed blood\" to denote Native American literature, when he himself is also part Irish and part Welsh. (Arguably most writing in today's \"global village\" is mixed blood.) Nevertheless, this book provides a needed overview of the Native American literature canon and the problems inherent in giving it a fully aware reading. Owens admirably makes readers question double standards by which they judge \"authentic\" Native American literature. Best are the essays deconstructing the John Wayne and \"Indians\" myths and such movies as",

        ". Not so effective are rebuttals of fellow academics' theories on the subject. But all pieces in this collection beg reflection on Native American experience and writing.",

        "A resident of the Choctaw-Cherokee-Welsh-Irish-Cajun mixed space lying in between unhyphenated cultures, University of Oklahoma English professor and novelist Owens (The Sharpest Sight, 1992) writes acutely of a generally accepted fact of American life: that most of us come from mixed backgrounds, our pedigrees a tangle of bloodlines and nationalities. In his instance, this tangle becomes problematic: billed as a Native American writer but shunned by certain Native critics (such as the Lakota scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, who comes in for quite a shellacking in his pages) for not being pure enough of blood, Owens is no garden-variety WASP, either. His examinations of works by Native writers such as N. Scott Momaday and Gerald Vizenor explore their negotiations between ancestral cultures and the dominant Anglo culture of the university and the publishing world; these essays are unfailingly interesting (if sometimes too heavily burdened by current critical jargon). So, too, are Owenss dissections of the portrayal of Native Americans in hallmark films like Kevin Costners Dances with Wolves (from beginning to end, the perfect, exquisite reenactment of the whole colonial enterprise in America . . . beautifully disguised as its opposite) and John Fords The Searchers (John Waynes most profound role in what [the film medium] has to say about Americas eroticized hatred of the indigenous peoples of America). Less interesting, however, and less successful, are his autobiographical excursions, which seem marked by a curious distance, as if Owens cannot quite find himself as a character in his own story; instead, he reiterates again and again his mixed-blood status, which forces him to check a single box on every form, without ever saying how this status affected his development as a writer and scholar. A valuable addition to Native American studies, nonetheless. --",
