        "The prices of recording equipment continue to drop dramatically, giving musicians and sound engineers increasing opportunities to make quality-level recordings. The Ultimate Guide to Music Recording takes a unique approach to this growing market, giving readers two books in one: a concise, tutorial audio engineering text in Part One, and then a ‘cut to the chase’, how to record any instrument fast guide in Part Two. By carefully cross-referencing these sections, industry vet Shea has created the ultimate recording resource: a textbook where you can see immediately how basic principles are utilized in the studio, and a “how-to” guide that comes complete with all the background technical material one could need – particularly when things don’t turn out as planned. Covering the basics of studio recording technology, recording techniques for every major class of instrument, and a masterclass on mixing, this is the most complete guide to music recording ever written."
