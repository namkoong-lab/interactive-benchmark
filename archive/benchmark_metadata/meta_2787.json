        "From the Author",
        "When my son was first diagnosed with special dietary needs, it was a relief. We finally had answers for his health issues. What I didn't realize at first was that, besides attending to his nutritional needs, I would also be guiding him through the acceptance of his diagnosis, and navigating having to eat differently than all his friends.

Today she spends her time with her husband, chasing their two kids, and dreaming up her next publication.",
