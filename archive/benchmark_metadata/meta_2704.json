        "Review",
        "Like No Other Boy is a deeply moving story about a father desperate to get through to his autistic son. After a messy divorce and dealing with an aging father as his life falls down around him, Chris is wrought with insecurities. He feels like an utter failure in his life. Readers see him go through the struggle of panicked public meltdown from his son, Tommy, and question his own capability of presenting Tommy with the connection he needs. His ex-wife, Cheryl, is a constant reminder that their difference of opinions is what drove them apart as she takes him through a trial for custody over their son.﻿﻿              The writing in this book is absolutely astounding. This is not a world I am familiar with at all. I am not a parent, I have not been married or divorced, I do not have aging parents at the moment, I don't personally know someone with autism yet the writer makes these plots seem relatable and meaningful to everyone. I could feel the painful parental experience of discussing the chemicals in Tommy's brain nonchalantly - as if it was completely normal. I could feel the frustration from Chris as he urges his father to slow down and stop doing housework that will land him in the hospital. I could also feel the intense moments between Tommy and the chimpanzees he experiences and how much it meant to Chris to see his son come alive for the first time.﻿﻿              The tone of the writing perfectly illustrates whatever event is happening at that time. When Tommy is making headway with the chimpanzees, the writing becomes elated and hopeful. When Tommy is in the hospital, the writing is worried and tense. Through the writing of Chris' internal monologue, we see the deeply pitted emotional bond that Chris has with his son and we root him on as a result.﻿﻿              I give this book four stars. It is heartwarming and tear-jerking and fascinating on so many levels. This book is a raw look at what it means to be a parents of autism and inter-generational connections. REVIEWED BYDaniella Poloni",

        "\"A poignantly penned and memorable tale of paternal love and struggle,",
        "Like No Other Boy",
        "by Larry Center is a heartfelt novel that honestly explores a complex and poorly understood condition. Showing the symptoms, scope, and unpredictability of autism through a father's occasionally overwhelmed eyes helps this story hit home. This story also demonstrates the incredible power of animal interactions, and the unspoken peace they can bring to children, adults, and everyone in between. The prose is both authentic and educational, particularly for those readers without direct experience of developmental delays. With carefully chosen descriptive language, a clear foundation of in-depth research, and a sensitive storytelling style, this novel is a raw and revelatory look at both the universal and unique challenges of parenting.\" Self-Publishing Review, ★★★★★",
        "From the Inside Flap",
        "Publisher's Weekly:Center's heartfelt tale of an autistic boy's uncanny ability to relate to chimpanzees is emotionally affecting. Following a brutal divorce, Chris Crutcher and Cheryl Bridgewater split custody of their son, Tommy. While Cheryl obsesses over psychology-based treatment for Tommy's autism, Chris tries to accept his son as he is. After Tommy appears to communicate in a meaningful way with chimps he sees through the glass walls of an exhibit at the San Diego Zoo, representatives from the Weller Institute, a renowned primatology research center, ask to study the special connection between child and chimpanzee. While Chris sees the perfect opportunity to support his son, Cheryl insists Tommy attend a more traditional school in Houston, threatening a lawsuit that could separate the family for good.﻿﻿﻿Chris's ever-evolving relationship with his aging father is a great accent to the primary story line, briefly touching on the guarded masculinity of many father-son relationships. Chris's frustrations as the father of a disabled child feel real; although he loves Tommy, he will never fully understand him, and the author finely emphasizes this divide. Though the story often strays into idealism, it's grounded in a genuine humanity that will speak to readers' hearts.",

He is inrigued with the idea of language development in children and the power of animal communication, the possibility that perhaps there is a layer where they both meet. Perhaps there's more to communication than meets the ear. He has a degree in philosophy and tends to look at the world through a lens that questions reality, its limits and boundaries. He writes his novels listening to the music of Don Henley in the background. He is hard at work on other novels.\"]}"
