        "Lidow, an academic and entrepreneur, sets out to help entrepreneurs succeed by way of his notion of leadership, which is “required to take an initial idea to the point where it has become an enterprise that produces value and is self-sustaining.” Self-sustaining means the business can operate whether or not the founder is active and it can attract new customers through innovation in products or services, replacing customers that have been lost. The author distinguishes between an entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial leader (EL), or one who grows the enterprise to be self-sustainable. Required skills of an EL include being self-aware, building relationships, motivating others, leading change, and understanding the leadership needs of enterprises as they mature. The author tells stories about entrepreneurs and provides lessons in each instance on how they attain success or suffer failure and concludes with an excellent set of appendixes. Though this could be used as a textbook, it is user-friendly and a valuable handbook for many library patrons for learning about entrepreneurship and what it takes to become an EL. --Mary Whaley",
