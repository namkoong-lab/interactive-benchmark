        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "The Christmas in My Heart franchise has been going strong for a full decade now; this tenth-anniversary edition follows the usual formula of fostering Christmas spirit through old-time stories and woodcut illustrations. Some of the better tales in this collection adhere to an anniversary-appropriate theme of remembrance Pearl S. Buck undoubtedly takes top honors here, offering a mature and reflective story about a widow who uses her Christmas alone to remember the joys and sorrows of her marriage. Fans of less subtle, more tear-inducing Christmas yarns will dig out the Kleenex for Frank McMillan's \"Terry\" and Seth Parker's \"No Man Need Walk Alone,\" while romantics will enjoy boy-meets-girl-on-Christmas-Eve stories from Margaret Sangster and Grace Livingston Hill.",
