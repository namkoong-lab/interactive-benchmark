        "THE ENDURING VISION'S engaging narrative integrates political, social, and cultural history within a chronological framework. Known for its focus on the environment and the land, the text is also praised for its innovative coverage of cultural history, public health and medicine, and the West--including Native American history. The 7th Edition brings the work fully up-to-date, and was revised line-by-line to create a sharper narrative. A new feature, called \"Going to the Source,\" is a one page excerpt of a primary source. These appear throughout each chapter with analysis questions to serve as review. Chapters 26-29 have been reorganized to consolidate coverage of the Cold War, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War, so that each is addressed cohesively."
