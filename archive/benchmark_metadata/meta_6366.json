    "description": [
        "If you own multiple trailers or frequently tow a variety of loads, you know how much time and money are spent tailoring your towing system to each and every individual trailer. There is nothing more inconvenient than switching back and forth between a few different ball mounts and trying to remember which mount fits with which trailer. A CURT adjustable ball mount is your multipurpose towing solution. This CURT channel mount uses a shank with multiple mounting holes to allow for easy height adjustment. A variety of attachments -- including a two-sided trailer ball, a ball mount tongue and ball and pintle combinations -- can be mounted in the channel to accommodate a variety of towing situations. This lock set adds security and peace of mind to your towing setup, allowing you to replace one of the pins in the channel mount with a key-operated lock. The locks are similar to the style of our hitch locks and feature a zinc finish and dust caps to ensure lasting use. The locks are keyed alike and can be used on any CURT adjustable channel mounts. Four keys are included in this package."
