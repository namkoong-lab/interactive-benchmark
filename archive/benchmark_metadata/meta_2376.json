        "A mostly true story about the amazing friendship between a wild goose and a ‘ferocious’ guard dog in Taghkanic, New York. We watched this happen, just down the street from our house. A goose and a big guard dog hanging out, day in and day out for several years. We concluded that the dog was very lonely and needed friendship and the goose needed protection. And those primal needs blossomed into something more."

        "This review is from: Lucy and Max: A mostly true story about the amazing friendship between a wild goose and a 'ferocious' guard dog in Taghkanic, New York. (Kindle Edition)",
        "New York State author Dan Udell has that kind of life that embraces all things of the mind and soul - music, writing, photography, science, technology and the wonders of nature. He earned degrees in physics and mathematics form Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, offered his talent as a writer with IBM (science, technology and photoessays and videography presentations for historic events), and curated art exhibitions as well as being the featured artist in many solo photographic exhibitions. Now, turning to a novel/memoir medium he places before us one of the more unusual and fascinating true stories - LUCY AND MAX -a very unusual pairing of the canine and avian worlds, an inexplicable goose and dog alliance, true and lasting.In this completely charming rather short tale Dan Udell combines black and white drawings of both of his main characters, Lucy the goose and Max the dog, with beautifully spaced floating paragraphs telling us of the 'accidental' meeting of Lucy (who suffered a broken wing during fall flight) and Max chained to his dog house, their gradual building of trust and respect and protection from 'outsider' animals as well as Jack (Max's owner), and through the narration by Dan we learn of the idiosyncrasies of this strange but very tender and understated relationship between goose and dog. We travel the seasons together, learn of encounters with outsiders and the growing relationship that forms so that when Lucy's wing finally heals and she can once again fly, the ongoing relationship continues.It is as quiet and lovely as that, but the beauty of the story is the unexpected innocence and friendship that proves that colleagues and friends are where you find them - despite what the outside world may think! A beautiful little melody of nature told and illustrated with elegance and love. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 16",
