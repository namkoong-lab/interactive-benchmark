        "Kotobukiya's Marvel Bishoujo statue line continues with none other than fan favorite Spider-Gwen! Spider-Gwen comes in for a landing, one leg outstretched and ready to shoot a web from her left hand. Based on a new character interpretation by Shunya Yamashita, Spider-Gwen looks amazing in her black, white, and pink costume. Gwen stands 22 cm (nearly 9 inches) tall in 1:7 scale."
