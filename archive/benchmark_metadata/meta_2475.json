        "It Worked for Me",
        "is filled with vivid experiences and lessons learned that have shaped the legendary public service career of the four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. At its heart are Powell's \"Thirteen Rules\"—notes he gathered over the years and that formed the basis of his leadership presentations given throughout the world. Powell's short but sweet rules—among them, \"Get mad, then get over it\" and \"Share credit\"—are illustrated by revealing personal stories that introduce and expand upon his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others. In work and in life, Powell writes, \"it's about how we touch and are touched by the people we meet. It's all about the people.\"",
        "A natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables with wise advice on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. \"Trust your people,\" he counsels as he delegates presidential briefing responsibilities to two junior State Department desk officers. \"Do your best—someone is watching,\" he advises those just starting out, recalling his own teenage summer job mopping floors in a soda-bottling factory.",
        "Powell combines the insights he has gained serving in the top ranks of the military and in four presidential administrations with the lessons he's learned from his immigrant-family upbringing in the Bronx, his training in the ROTC, and his growth as an Army officer. The result is a powerful portrait of a leader who is reflective, self-effacing, and grateful for the contributions of everyone he works with.",

        "It Worked for Me",
        "I love stories. In the course of my career I gathered a number of them that mean a lot to me. Most come from my military life. I was in the military from age seventeen as an ROTC cadet until I was a retired GI at age fifty-six. Others came from my service as Secretary of State and as National Security Advisor. Yet others came to me as I wandered through life. In this book I want to share with you a selection of these stories as well as experiences that have stayed with me over the years. Each one of them taught me something important about life and leadership. Some of the stories deal with serious aspects of my life, including some of the controversial issues I was involved in during my tenure as Secretary of State. There are also humorous stories from my life as well. I offer them to you for whatever use you may wish to make of them.",
