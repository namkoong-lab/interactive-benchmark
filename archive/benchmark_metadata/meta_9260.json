        "This is the first general history of World War II to be based both on the existing literature and on extensive work in British, American and German archives. It covers all the theaters of war, the weaponry used, and developments on the home front. Taking a global perspective, the work deals with all belligerents and relates events in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, and the Pacific to each other. The role of diplomacy and strategy, of intelligence and espionage, and the impact of war upon society are all dealt with, often on the basis of hitherto unknown material. New light is shed on the actions of great and small powers and on topics ranging from the beginning of the war to the dropping of the atomic bombs; the titanic battles on the Eastern Front are fitted into the war as a whole; the killing of six million Jews and millions of others is placed into context; and the fighting at sea and in the air is included in a coherent view of the great conflict."

        "Amazon.com Review",
        "This comprehensive examination of the Second World War looks at grand strategy and diplomacy, as opposed to the gritty details of the combat experience.",
        "A World at Arms",
        "is written in a matter-of-fact tone, so don't expect a poetic narrative. Despite this, no other historian has presented such a sweeping overview. Weinberg performs the important task of reminding his readers in the West that much of the fighting--and perhaps the most decisive parts--was done in the East, between the Germans and the Russians. American readers, for their part, may appreciate Weinberg's treatment of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who is portrayed as a courageous wartime leader. This book is an essential part of any library on the Second World War.",
        "Review",
        "\"No one, scholars included, should presume to know about the Second World War if they have not read this book.\" American Heritage\"...Weinberg has written the most authoritative single-volume account of the Second World War, a book that the author describes, with ample reason, as a \"global history.\" It's easy enough to tell what happended, but to explain why requires the sort of vast knowledge that Weinberg commands.\" Forbes\"...a blockbuster of a survey, grounded, to a remarkable extent for so large a work, in primary sources and also in an evident mastery of the secondary literature. It is a joy to read: lively, vigorous, and...altogether a stylistic gem....[it] offers refreshinly forthright judgments on every major aspect of World War II strategy and policy.\" Naval War College Review\"The bulk of the book, over 900 pages, delivers a clearly written chronological narrative of the war....Weinberg's book is based not only on mastery of the published literature, but is also the product of fifteen years of archival research....In terms of its comprehensiveness and disciplined scholarship, the work outshines that of his predecessors.\" The Boston Book Review\"A World at Arms provided me with an entirely new panorama of the world at war. I'm overwhelmed with its refreshing sense of candor, its incisive and direct overview of the global conflict of our times. A magnificent read!\" Kathy Anderson, General Trade Buyer, University Bookstore, UC-San Diego\"...the text is a masterpiece of clear, level-headed explanation...It certainly deserves to be placed alongside the war histories of John Keegan, Martin Gilbert, and A.J.P. Taylor. As a sheer work of reference, it outclasses even them.\" Andrew Roberts, Sunday Telegraph\"This is the book on the Second World War that we have been waiting for, a truly global analysis which conveys the breadth, craftsmanship and sagacious insights of a master historian.\" Carole Fink, author of Marc Bloch\"A most impressive work, the product of a distinguished historian at the height of his powers. Written in a clear and direct style, the book is peppered with sharp insights and shrewd observations and should appeal to a very wide audience.\" Jeremy Noakes, author of Nazism 1919-1945 and Intelligence and International Relations, 1900-45\"Few historians could have taken on the daunting challenge of attempting a global history of the Second World War; but Gerhard Weinberg succeeds brilliantly. It is a masterly study which is unlikely to be surpassed.\" Ian Kershaw, author of Nazi Dictatorship and Hitler\"Gerhard Weinberg is probably the world's leading expert on Hitler's foreign policy and his book on the second world war, A World At Arms, published in 1994, is by far the best single-volume history of that global sonflict.\" Vernon Bogdanor, Professor of Government at Oxford University",

        "Book Description",
        "This is the first general history of World War II to be based both on the existing literature and on extensive work in British, American and German archives. It covers all the theatres of war, the weaponry used, and developments on the home front. Unlike other books on the war which rely heavily on dubious memoirs, treat different theaters as is they were appended to one another, or concentrate on the country of the author, this one is based on research in the archives and looks at the war as the global catastrophe it was.",
