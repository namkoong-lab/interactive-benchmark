        "A record of Atlantic Monthly authors reads like a Who's Who of American literature. The magazine's stable of contributors included Mark Twain, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Frederick Douglass, Louisa May Alcott, Sarah Orne Jewett, Kate Chopin, Henry Adams, Frank Norris, Jack London, Henry James, Owen Wister, Robert Frost, and many others.In Republic of Words, Susan Goodman brilliantly captures this emerging culture of arts, ideas, science, and literature of an America in its adolescence, as filtered through the intersecting lives and words of the best and brightest writers of the day. Through this lens, Goodman examines the life of the magazine from its emergence in 1857 through the 1920s."

        "Review",
        "&#8220;Taking her cue from editors such as William Dean Howells, who &#8216;knew that books lived as much on author&#8217;s personalities as on their contents&#8217;, Goodman&#8217;s own book, with its Dickensian array of characters, stands out amid drier studies of the same milieu.&#8221;&#8212;",
        "Times Literary Supplement",
        "&#8220;Goodman delivers an admirably concise but textured examination of one of the nation&#8217;s leading intellectual magazines. . . . Melding textual analyses with biographical and historical background, the author provides something of a microcosmic look at the writing of an astonishing number of literary luminaries who graced the publication&#8217;s pages. . . . Highly recommended.&#8221;&#8212;",
