But after one visit, Motoharu winds up with an unexpected commitment. Ironworker Ohki Kouta is young, foul-mouthed, and not at all Motoharu's type!Architect Maki Motoharu is hanging out at the construction site ogling a particular hunky, well-toned construction worker when he is unexpectedly reunited with his lost cat, Shinobu. The reunion is all thanks to Ohki Kouta, a foul-mouthed young ironworker who found and cared for the lost cat. Unfortunately for Ohki, this act of kindness led to his eviction! When Maki agrees to take in young Ohki, will he be able to tame this feisty stray? Includes a bonus “P.B.B” side story."
