        "Size is approximate for general description. Reproduction image size varies based on original poster dimension ratios. Because this is a reproduction of an original poster it will feature the same characteristics as the original which can include registration issues, discoloration, etc. Every effort has been made to mitigate these issues but some add to the character of the piece and so have been left intact. Please do not buy a frame until you have received your poster as some customization may be required. Item ships rolled in a tube. Please e-mail any questions. If there is something specific you are looking for send us a message!"
