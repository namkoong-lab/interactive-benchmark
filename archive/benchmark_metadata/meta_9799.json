        "Growing your own mushrooms on straw logs or sawdust blocks is the perfect way to enjoy fresh mushrooms at home. It is a fun project to engage in and is low maintenance. Even if you do not have a large backyard, mushroom growing can be a great addition to your urban garden . Any hardwood loving mushrooms can be grown on straw, wood chips or sawdust blocks, including Shiitake, Oysters, Reishi, and Lion’s Mane. Mushroom cultivation involves first \"inoculating\" the substrate of your choice with mushroom mycelium, and then allowing the mycelium to colonize over a period of 2-3 weeks. When the substrate is fully colonized- and the conditions, such as light, moisture, and temperature, are right- the mushrooms will emerge from the substreate and can be harvested and enjoyed."
