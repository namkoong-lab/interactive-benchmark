        "Are expensive router bits worth the cost? Because of the features found in these Freud bits--long-lasting micrograin carbide/titanium tips, tri-metal brazing, and an antikickback design-- our answer is a resounding",
        "yes",
        ". Each Freud bit is computer-balanced to run vibration- and chatter-free at speeds well in excess of the typical 22,000 rpm of most routers. These bits have a high shear angle that produces less tear-out and chatter marks, leaving a cross-grained cut that requires little or no sanding. Multiaxis grinding helps ensure the proper relief angle on cutting edges regardless of how the bit is oriented. This nine-piece set includes a nice variety of bits and is ideal for the beginning woodworker.",
        "--Tim Block",
        "From the Manufacturer",

The shanks are 1/4 inch, and all bits are solid carbide tipped for long lasting sharpness. A wooden box is provided for protection and storage. The bits will cuts all composition materials, plywood, hardwood, and softwood, and can be used on handheld and table-mounted portable routers.",
