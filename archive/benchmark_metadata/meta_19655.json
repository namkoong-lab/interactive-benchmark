        "Product Description",
        "Here is an idea: This spring, fly to St. Martin or one of the other Caribbean islands and buy a sailboat. Then, next Halloween (or so) pack up the family and move on to the boat for the winter. You and your family can spend the first month learning to sail, then explore the islands, home-school the kids, and enjoy tropical living. If things go well, when you return home and sell the boat you might even make enough to pay for the trip. Sound far-fetched? This family of four from Camano Island, Washington did exactly that. Overcoming a lack of sailing and cruising experience with research, good advice and attitude, they had a great time and a great adventure as they sailed the Caribbean and the Bahamas. Also, the companion book (paperback and Kindle) is now available here on Amazon.com. Please search \"Books\" for 0972790616.",
        "Review",
        "Cruising World calls the video \"An inspirational primer on how to cruise the Caribbean with kids.\" Perfect for a family evening, the half-hour video shows what to expect on a cruising trip. Well edited, with digital quality video and professional production values, the fast-moving video covers buying and preparing the boat, typical days at anchor and on passage, favorite activities, and things to watch out for. Shockingly beautiful scenic and underwater pictures bring the tropics to your television. There s even insider footage of Open Ocean sailboat racing from the Sint Maarten Yacht Club Heineken Regatta. --Cruising World Magazine"
