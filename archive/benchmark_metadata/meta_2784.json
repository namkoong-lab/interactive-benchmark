        ". Stafford uses the dominatrix language well and with humor in this entertaining, beautifully designed, and instructive book. A stern but encouraging teacher, she approaches knitting and designing knitwear in a way best described as punishing, but she does not expect her readers to do the same. She does expect them to take her advice and discipline their knitting. If you do, she promises results. Rip if you must. Knit a gauge or two or three until you get it right. Her advice is universally good, and she shares many useful tips. Obviously a serious knitwear designer, Stafford favors structured pieces and has included funky, form-fitting projects with broad appeal. She is a strong advocate of continental style, and some of her techniques are different from the standard instructions. This may be a difficult book to learn to knit from, since some steps are glossed over, such as how to make a slip knot; and some techniques, such as provisional cast on, could use an extra step or two for clarification. Knitters with the basics (cast on, knit, and purl) will find this a fun and highly instructional book to take them from scarf to structured clothing. Stafford's unique voice and style are the heart of the book. Unlike with many instruction books that might be flipped through, knitters will find themselves reading Stafford's entertaining prose cover to vinyl cover.",
