Orser was born in Bismarck, North Dakota, and has lived much of her life there. Among her fondest memories are those from the time she spent visiting her grandparents in Rugby, North Dakota, and going with them to the cabin her grandfather built on Lake Metigoshe in the 1930s. Lake Metigoshe, cupped in Turtle Mountain with shoreline in both the U.S. and Canada, plays a significant role in much of Lori's fiction.\", 'Lori started telling stories, with characters and plots, when she was three; she did wait until she was 8 to write her first story, though. Hooked on the \"scary\" comic books of the 60s, and shows like Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, she loved ghost stories, all things paranormal, and science fiction, and those, along with good mysteries, were the books that were among her best friends in childhood. Some of her writing influences are Ambrose Bierce, August Derleth, E.A. Poe, Sarah Rayne, S.J. Bolton, F.G. Cottom, Phil Rickman, \"The Shining\" by Stephen King, and Noel Hynd. Favorite reads include Bolton, Cottam, Rickman and Hynd, along with Tracy Grant, Jane Kirkpatrick, M.M. Justus, Ian S. Rutter, and Velda Brotherton, along with a host of cozy mystery authors.', 'Although at heart a writer of fiction, she wrote Spooky Creepy North Dakota when the contract was offered her. Spooky Creepy South Dakota is forthcoming from Schiffer Publishing, but there is no release date at this time.', \"Lori went to the University of North Dakota in frozen Grand Forks, majoring in anthropology (including some cross-listed Native American Studies courses) and German; she went on to Kansas University in Lawrence for an MA in linguistics. Her thesis research on the Michif (also spelled Metchif)language spoken on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa allowed her to spend time in an area she loves while hearing and recording a number of traditional stories, both Chippewa/Cree and French-Canadian. You'll find a couple of these in Spooky Creepy North Dakota.\"]}"
