It is the morning but there is no sun yet, just white light around the edges. It is the time to get the eggs. Time for my best thing. The eggs they shine with their white and I do not need the light to find them. The foxes need no light either. I am a little like the fox, he is a little like me.",
        "Lucy is a young woman with an uncommon voice and an unusual way of looking at the world. She doesn’t understand why her mother has sent her to live with old Mister and Missus on their farm, but she knows she must never leave or her mother won’t be able to find her again.

        "Sarkissian’s bold debut novel features a unique protagonist, the affectionate and eccentric Lucy, a mentally challenged young girl sent to live on a farm after her mother is no longer able to care for her. Also living there is Samantha, a pregnant teenager who takes Lucy under her wing while Lucy waits to be reunited with her mother. Lucy is eager to please those around her and is fascinated with the idea of family, particularly with her hope of seeing Samantha together with the father of her baby. But Samantha has promised the baby to the farm’s owners, known as Mister and Missus. Interjections of Missus’ first-person narration slowly reveal a tormented past involving the loss of her adopted daughter years earlier. When the baby is born and Samantha has a change of heart, Lucy takes off on an unexpected journey to fulfill a promise to Samantha. Lucy’s dazzling stream of consciousness is heightened with elements of fantasy—she is accompanied and guided by a talking pet chicken—while Sarkissian tenderly depicts her characters’ frailties, fears, and desires. --Leah Strauss",
