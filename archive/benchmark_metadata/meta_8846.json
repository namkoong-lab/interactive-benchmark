        "The New York Review of Books",
        "“This is India. I don’t know any other book that comes so near to capturing the whole crazy spectrum. . . . Brilliant.” —",
        "The Observer",
        "“His narrative skill is spectacular. One returns with pleasure to the slow hand-in-hand revelation of both India and himself. . . . There is a kind of displaced person who has a better sense of place than anybody: Mr. Naipaul is an outstanding example.” —",

        "(London) “[Naipaul’s] penetrating, opinionated travel writing . . . makes up a remarkable running commentary on the clash of civilizations.” —",
