        "Brass Jewelry Supplies",
        "Brass is a metallic alloy that is made of copper and zinc. It is popular in jewelry making because it provides good formability, high workability and durability, and resistance to corrosion in comparison to other metal alloy.",
        "Caring for Metal Jewelry – Metal should not come in contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store jewelry in a jewelry box or pouch. Metal is prone to tarnish as metal naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. If the jewelry is made of gold and silver, cleaning them regularly will help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, using a gentle polish will help remove tarnish from the silver or gold.",
