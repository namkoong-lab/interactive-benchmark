        "Tell me your name, and I will tell you who you are. Give me your date of birth, and I will show you your future. The hidden meaning and power of numbers has been studied since ancient times. Just as astrologers use the planets and signs of the zodiac to explore relationships and predict the future, so do numerologists use numbers. Now, by following numerologist Norman Shine's clearly illustrated, easy-to-understand system, anyone can access and use the energy and power of numbers. Each letter of the alphabet has numerical value, and each number is an energy source. It is the way that these energies combine and relate to one another that determines how and why you behave the way you do; by comparing your numbers with another person's, you can explore your relationship to them. Plot the numbers of your birthday, and you can see the direction of your future."
