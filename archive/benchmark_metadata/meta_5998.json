        "Bravo Bells are made in the USA using state of the art lead-free pewter. Each Bravo Bell comes with a 24 mm nickel plated split ring and a 2″x 3 1/2″ velveteen drawstring black bag and a Bravo Bells Legend Card",
        "Meant to drive away Gremlins while on the road and a great way to remind fellow bikers that they need to stay safe. But there are a few rules",
        "Hang it from the lowest part of your bike. Gremlins will be trapped in its hollow if they try to reach for your bike. And hang it towards the front as the ringing drives them away",
        "If you buy your own bell the magic does work. But if you receive one as a gift from a friend or loved one the magic is twice as strong. If you ever sell your bike, keep the bell. It’s a precious gift of love and good will",
        "If you steal a bell off someone else’s bike you’ll get all the gremlins they would have had, on top of your own"

        "A BELLS PURPOSE: As the story goes, an old gray-beard biker traveling back from Mexico with a full moon on a cool desert night. He had his saddlebags full of trinkets for kids at home, biker friends. Everything seemed perfect, but he did not know of the gremlins waiting for him. These gremlins lay out traps on the road or deploy invisible devilish devices to break your bike. They herd the biker coming and scared a coyote onto the road right as the biker rounded the sharp turn. He skidded and went down. He woke up in the ditch and saw the gremlins moving toward him. His saddle bag was torn off and lay next to him. He started throwing things from his bag, and the only items that scared the Gremlins were the bells he bought for the children. He grabbed the bells and amazingly the ringing of the bell seems to confuse the gremlins. As it turned out a couple of bikers heard the bells and followed the sounds. They saw the biker and he seemed to be afraid of something, so they yelled to frighten away any animals. Old graybeard was so grateful for the rescue, he cut some tassels off his saddlebag, and used them to tie a bell to each of their bikes. He explained how they would warn off the gremlins, and if they were ever in trouble, they could ring the bell for help."
