        "After a whirlwind marriage to San Celina Police Chief Gabe Ortiz, Benni Harper is excited to visit her Kansas hometown. At a rowdy backyard barbecue, she meets Tyler Brown, an aspiring country singer with a promising future--and a fascinating past. Once, Tyler had lived the simple Amish life. Now she's determined to make it on her own selling her exquisite handmade quilts. But Tyler's gifts--and her life--are cut short when she's murdered. Out of his jurisdiction, Gabe is frustrated to sit on the sidelines while his friends are investigated by his own sleuthing wife.

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Newly married California museum curator Benni Harper travels to Kansas to meet her in-laws in this third of Fowler's quilt-pattern series (after Irish Chain). Police chief Gabe Ortiz, her husband, assures her that everyone in his small hometown will love her, but Benni, whose father, eccentric Aunt Dove and Uncle Arnie are driving from California to be with them, isn't so sure. At a party given by Gabe's sister, she introduces herself to Tyler Brown, whose quilt on the sister's living room wall she admires. Tyler, who says she left her Amish family a year ago to pursue a singing career, is visibly upset and says she's being harassed. Later that evening, Tyler's body is found, her head bashed in, leaving Gabe's childhood friends suspects in the murder. With the help of her sister-in-law, Benni attempts to identify the killer and, in the process, learns more about the pasts of her husband and his friends than she's sure she wants to know. Complicating matters further and adding comic relief to this grim tale are periodic calls from her family as they work their way across the country. Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "As cowgirl-turned-quilter Benni Harper might have expected, marriage to San Celina (Cal.) police chief Gabe Ortiz is no bed of roses. On her maiden voyage to Derby, Kansas, to meet her bridegroom's family, she finds them up to their Stetsons in murder. Local feed-and-grain scion Rob Harlow's newest girlfriend, country singer Tyler Brown, has been bashed to death with a brick, and everyone in town is a suspect. It's an especially rich field, since Tyler was AWOL from an Amish husband who couldn't get divorced as long as she lived, and her current activities weren't calculated to win new friends. Despite her distracting misgivings about her own husband's secrets, Benni's sharp eye for quilt patterns provides the crucial clue. And for that matter almost the only clue in Benni's third outing (Irish Chain, 1995, etc.), more notable for its double- wide raft of suspects and its affectionate prairie background than for its tight plotting. --",

Yes, there are a few of us that exist!', \"I've been married 48 years to my high school sweetheart, Allen, who was born in Kansas. We met when we were fifteen. We don't have children, but are currently owned by a scruffy and adorable rescue terrier mix named Ivy. Though I'm a native Southern Californian, my parents are not. My father was born in Colorado and grew up in a migrant worker family. My mother's family were cotton share croppers in Arkansas. I've been writing since I was in my late-twenties. I published my first novel, Fool's Puzzle, when I was in my late thirties. I like to ride horses when I can (and luckily, have friends who own horses), walk my dog, travel with my husband and, of course, love to read. There are four girls in my family. I'm the number two sister.\", \"I was named after my father and my grandfather. Both of them were named Earl. The first book I remember reading by myself was Curious George. I think it was the one where he went to the circus. My favorite fictional character is Old Yeller. He had courage and loyalty, two virtues I admire greatly. Back in the 1980's, for a year and a half, I taught a weekly craft class at a retirement home in Covina, California. My youngest member was in her late sixties; my oldest was ninety-eight. Those fifteen women taught me way more than I ever taught them. I love strawberry ice cream and fried tacos. Together or separately. Doesn't matter.\"]}"
