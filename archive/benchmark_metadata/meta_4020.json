Our drill pumps are designed for reliable, professional level use by using the highest quality materials in the enclosures and impellers. Additionally, ZUWA drill pumps are backed by JHProcess, located right outside of Philadelphia, with years of industry professional experience and outstanding customer service in the field of impeller pumps. OUR DRILL DRIVEN IMPELLER PUMPS Our pump series 2001-B is ideally driven with an Electric or Battery powered drill. The shaft can easily be fixed to the chuck of each regular electric or cordless drill and screwdriver. Connect the shaft of the pump with the chuck. The depth stop of the drill fully stabilizes the system and ready you are. Contrary to similar pumps on the market this pump is truly self-priming. It has a MACHINED METAL BODY instead of a cheap cast metal or plastic and a shaft with a top quality ball bearing which GUARANTEES A LONG LIFETIME."
