        "Memory foam's ability to reduce pressure points is one of the reasons so many people are using it to get the best night's sleep. Now you can enjoy the benefits of memory foam without having to buy a new mattress by adding this memory foam mattress topper to your existing spring, latex or even memory foam mattress. This topper will add comfort and increase the quality of sleep from your mattress immediately. Two inches of five pound density memory foam used in this topper is specifically designed to enhance the feel of your current mattress and also provides additional support in areas where your mattress may be dipping or sagging. The foam is also specially formulated to contour to your body at any temperature and will give you the extra comfort you need to get the best night's sleep possible from your current mattress. Our toppers have also earned the Purges certification, which means they are manufactured, fabricated and packaged in the U.S.A. meeting all EPA and CSPC standards being safe and free from harmful chemicals. Purges uses independent laboratory results to qualify products and ensure they are manufactured without the use of ozone-depleting substances such as Chlorofluorocarbons, Polybrominated Biphenyl Ether substances, Harmful Metals, Formaldehyde, Prohibited Palates or any other unsafe materials.

There may be a new foam smell associated with your new topper; however, this odor is not toxic or harmful passing all Purged, EPA and CSPC standards. MADE IN THE USA."
