        "Finally an expansive biography of one of the twentieth century’s greatest music and cultural icons From noted author and rock ’n’ roll journalist Marc Spitz comes a major David Bowie biography to rival any other. Following Bowie’s life from his start as David Jones, an R & B—loving kid from Bromley, England, to his rise to rock ’n’ roll aristocracy as David Bowie, Bowie recounts his career but also reveals how much his music has influenced other musicians and forever changed the landscape of the modern era. Along the way, Spitz reflects on how growing up with Bowie as his soundtrack and how writing this definitive book on Bowie influenced him in ways he never expected, adding a personal dimension that Bowie fans and those passionate about art and culture will connect with and that no other bio on the artist offers. Bowie takes an in-depth look at the culture of postwar England in which Bowie grew up, the mod and hippie scenes of swinging London in the sixties, the sex and drug-fueled glitter scene of the early seventies when Bowie’s alter-ego Ziggy Stardust was born, his rise to global stardom in the eighties and his subsequent status as an elder statesman of alternative culture. Spitz puts each incarnation of Bowie into the context of its era, creating a cultural time line that is intriguing both for its historical significance as well as for its delineation of this rock ’n’ roll legend, the first musician to evolve a coherent vision after the death of the sixties dream. Amid the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll mayhem, a deeper portrait of the artist emerges. Bowie’s early struggles to go from follower to leader, his tricky relationship with art and commerce and Buddhism and the occult, his complicated family life, his open romantic relationship and, finally, his perceived disavowal of all that made him a touchstone for outcasts are all thoughtfully explored. A fresh evaluation of his recorded work, as well as his film, stage and video performances, is included as well. Based on a hundred original interviews with those who knew him best and those familiar with his work, including ex-wife Angie Bowie, former Bowie manager Kenneth Pitt, Siouxsie Sioux, Camille Paglia, Dick Cavett, Todd Haynes, Ricky Gervais and Peter Frampton, Bowie gives us not only a portrait of one of the most important artists in the last century, but also an honest examination of a truly revolutionary artist and the unique impact he’s had across generations."

Born David Jones in the Brixton suburbs of London in 1947, Bowie treaded the musical edges from blues to mod to rock-and-roll, moving from band to band in his teens and trying out different personas. Assuming the name of an American frontiersman who died at the Alamo, Bowie took his cues from influences as diverse as Bob Dylan, the Velvet Underground, and Marcel Marceau, playing with mime, theater, fashion and sheer showmanship.

        "From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Louis Bayard A life of David Bowie, fine, but which life? Or, more pressingly, which hair? The long tresses of his psychedelic folk days or Ziggy Stardust's Red Hot Red mullet? The Thin White Duke's lounge-lizard updraft or the peroxide squiff of \"Let's Dance\" or the Satanic pompadour of Tin Machine? Or the chastened chestnut of recent years? A million or so hairstyles, all told, with as many men attached, and it's up to music writer Marc Spitz to sort through them all. He begins with the youngest incarnation: a boy named David Jones, born in 1947 to a tight-lipped family in a drab London suburb called Brixton. At age 3, David puts on makeup for the first time. His mother points out that makeup isn't for little boys. This just makes him want to grow up faster. His first and only office job comes right out of high school with an ad agency, but he soon chucks it to pursue the highly promising career of rock-and-roll legend. And why not? He's talented, he's mad with ambition, he's roughly the same age as the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who. But somehow it takes him six years to reach escape velocity, during which he logs three flop albums and nearly a dozen flop singles. He finds salvation as Ziggy Stardust, a brazenly theatrical creation -- imagine the Little Prince refracted through Quentin Crisp -- that provides the ideal home for his oracular baritone and polysexual prankishness. On the strength of songs such as \"Space Oddity,\" \"Starman\" and \"Changes,\" the androgyne-faun becomes a cult figure on both sides of the Atlantic, the first rock star \"to evolve a coherent vision of life after hippie.\" It's off to America, where else? Bowie holes up in Los Angeles, where he subsists on \"coffee, Marlboros, red and green peppers and whole milk from the carton.\" And cocaine. A million nostrils' worth. He hallucinates around the clock. His weight drops to 85 pounds. He makes a strange sci-fi movie. Then he runs off to Germany, where he hunkers down with kindred soul Brian Eno and records a trilogy of albums that anticipates new wave and industrial music and pretty much everything that rises from punk rock's ashes. It isn't until 1983, though, that he achieves the monster crossover success he has hungered for. The aptly titled \"Let's Dance\" spawns three No. 1 singles, endless MTV rotation and global arena saturation. David Bowie has arrived, which means he is now free to . . . go away. That at least is his fate in this biography, which devotes a scant 75 pages to the past 25 years of his career. And those pages must perforce include the infamous Glass Spider tour, which featured, yes, a very large spider and Peter Frampton and dancers working hard for the money. These days, Bowie is, by most accounts, happily married to African supermodel Iman and comfortable in his pop statesman status and having a good time with the Internet and hence not nearly as interesting as that itchy young Casanova who ran out on every musical genre the moment he had coaxed it into bed. He spread his seed wide, though. We see his likeness in the cyclical (and cynical) re-inventions of Madonna; in the synth and electro-pop of the Smiths, Depeche Mode and Moby; in the gender-blurring tropes of Duran Duran and Boy George (and, most recently, \"American Idol\" finalist Adam Lambert); in the careers Bowie personally nurtured: Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Mott the Hoople, Luther Vandross. One way or another, a lot of artists -- and music critics -- have fallen under Bowie's spell. Spitz is one of them. \"Hunky Dory,\" he opines, is \"an album that puts you into a panic attack because you cannot immediately put your ears on it.\" The album \"Young Americans\" \"can still make me break down and cry.\" \"It's no stretch to say that 'Life on Mars?' is one of the best pop songs ever written.\" Well, I think that is a stretch, but then I'm not particularly stirred by \"Heroes,\" either. \"Space Oddity\" is a more original and arresting concept than the song it obviously influenced -- \"Rocket Man\" -- but Elton John's melodic gift leaves Bowie on the far side of Saturn. As music critic Robert Christgau notes, Bowie has \"no special gift for convincing emotions or good tunes. . . . What makes [him] a worthy entertainer is his pretensions, his masks, the way he simulates meaning.\" This is also what makes Bowie a dicey proposition for analysis. Spitz has interviewed dozens of his friends and colleagues and has engaged passionately with each album. (\"Drums crash like steam shooting from a vent pipe; the bass burbles lightly like a toxic substance in a glass beaker purified over a Bunsen burner. The guitars come in cold and impossibly mellow.\") But he is up against biographical antimatter. The more you try to explain David Bowie -- reduce him, say, to \"a shy, suburban kid\" -- the less you explain. Because, in the end, how many shy suburban kids pose for an album cover in a Chinese silk-velour dress? The issue here is not complexity but vacancy. A shape that shifts as readily as Bowie's may well be suspected of having no center. Give scientists time, and they might even find a way to re-create Bowie as a computer app, combining bits of Oscar Wilde and Little Richard and Anthony Newley and the Velvet Underground and \"A Clockwork Orange\" and even Dale Carnegie. What the program will leave out, of course, is that errant spark of pop divinity. Which is the one thing no biographer can capture, either. bookworld@washpost.com Copyright 2010, The Washington Post.

        "1.There's an alien in the window of the house next door to the one where David Bowie was born at 40 Stansfield Road in Brixton, a southern borough of London. It peers out, gray skinned, with black, oval-shaped eyes and a tennis-racket-sized skull, the same kind of inflatable spacemen for sale in the gas station gift shops that one stops at while driving through Roswell, New Mexico. X-Files/E.T.-faced aliens. It might not be there now, should you decide to make a new pilgrimage, but it was there when I traveled to Brixton, as if to say, \"Welcome, biographer!\"Whoever lives in the virtually identical home at 38 Stansfield Road, they certainly know who was born next door. If the alien had eyelids it'd be winking. Otherwise, this block, like every other block in the area, is as quiet as it must have been in the harsh winter of 1947. The house itself is three stories high, pale brick, with a double-arched doorway painted French white. A chest-high brick wall separates the house from the adjacent buildings. Another brick wall girds the property, sectioning off a very tiny lawn and a spindled tree that extends just past the chimney. It's a handsome if compact residence. Unlike the city of Brixton, which was predominantly a white, middle-class enclave in the years just after World War II, this home is static. In another fifty-two years, while jet packs and flying cars travel overhead, one can imagine it looking exactly the same. There's no brass plaque here marking David Bowie's birth, but it is, nonetheless, a landmark, one pristinely preserved whether by design, accident or simple lack of means or inclination. That he came into the world inside is hardly unique; many children in the late forties were born at home and not in a hospital. Midwives were summoned once the water broke, as one would call a plumber or policeman. The house's real significance has less to do with David Bowie's and more to do with his mother and father's story anyhow. This was a second-chance home, the place where they hoped to build a strong family unit after their dark and complicated childhoods and some false starting on either side with regard to romance and parenthood. Brixton was still in wreckage thanks to the Nazi buzz bombs and the depleted nation's inability to quickly rebuild when David's mother, Margaret Mary Burns, from Royal Tunbridge Wells in the county of Kent, met his father, Haywood Stenton Jones, from Doncaster, Yorkshire. She was known as Peggy and he as John. It was not a posh area but it was theirs, a place to create new memories and remain protected from the area pain they'd known.Of the two, Peggy had the most to distance herself from. Several incidents occurred in her teens and early twenties that could cumulatively take on the characteristics of a Burns family curse. Mental illness seemed to be seared deeply into the genetic code (as has been well documented by other biographers and commented on by Bowie himself) David spent much of his adult life wondering when, not if, he was going to go legitimately mad. Schizophrenic behavior can lay dormant until triggered by a cataclysmic event. For Peggy, her three sisters and her brother, this event was of course the Second World War. However, Nora Burns, the second child, and Vivienne, the fifth, began exhibiting signs of mental illness early on. The constant explosions of the Luftwaffe's missiles and the nightmarish prospect of the Nazis occupying the United Kingdom coupled with the heartbreak of falling in love with a series of noncommittal soldiers would push their tendencies into full-blown afflictions during the war years. The disease manifested itself mostly as irrational behavior--nonsensical comments, unkempt appearance, chain-smoking, promiscuity, extreme passivity--so it can be argued, given the seemingly domino-like effect it had on the Burns girls, that schizophrenia itself was another, if quieter, cataclysmic event. Peggy's father, Jimmy, was a professional soldier of modest means, and the home they shared on Meadow Lane was close-quartered enough to amplify any breach in acceptable social behavior. Certain studies do indicate that those with schizophrenic brothers and sisters are more likely to exhibit schizophrenic tendencies themselves. Someone with one schizophrenic parent is even more likely to develop the disease. Peggy ultimately exhibited behavior that might be considered borderline. She could be loud, theatrical, and act out. She was basically spared the full effects of the illness, possibly because it was not actually something that was inherited but rather a very, very sad coincidence within this one English family. Still, it was certainly a specter, and so, at age twenty-two, Peggy, the oldest, became the first Burns sibling to leave the house. She found work as a resident nanny for guests of a nearby hotel, the Culverden Park Arms. It was during this period that she had a well-documented but exceedingly brief dalliance with the Blackshirts, a faction of nationalists headed by a Parliament member named Oswald Mosley (\"Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo,\" in Elvis Costello's debut single \"Less Than Zero\"). Much has been made of this in other Bowie biographies, given David Bowie's also well-covered fascination with fascism four decades later in the mid-1970s. One need not be an apologist (or superfan) to see how Bowie's publicly stated and since recanted endorsement of Hitler's charisma and the merits of a fascist leader overtaking Britain, while speaking with Cameron Crowe in a notorious 1976 Playboy interview, was the product of cocaine psychosis rather than any real fidelity to notions of racial purity or governmental insurrection. Peggy's attraction (leading to a fleeting attendance of one rally) was, it's been said, even less substantial in its motivation. It was the actual black shirts, those sleek and slimming namesakes, that attracted her rather than loudly spat polemics against immigration and integration.Relationships started during wartime are often more passionate than those begun during peace and prosperity. Peggy, with her high forehead, elegant nose, pale skin and dark, humorous eyes, possessed a certain unconventional, very English beauty. Although willful and independent, she was not immune to the rush of untethered emotion that seemed to wash over her generation with the declaration of war. While working at the hotel, she began a relationship with an employee, a handsome Jewish Frenchman named Wolf Rosemberg (who called himself Jack). He worked as a porter in the bar. His father was a well-off fur dealer in Paris. Their affair began in secret in the spring of 1937. She believed that she had met the love of her life. Soon afterward, she learned that she was pregnant. Rosemberg proposed. Their first and only child, Terence Guy Adair Burns, was born in the local Pembury Hospital on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day (hence his middle name). Adair was a family name. Everyone called the baby Terry.Jack and Peggy would never marry, and Terry would never really know his biological father. Early in 1938, the Nazis began annexing Eastern Europe and eventually invaded France. Jack returned to his family and joined up with the Resistance. He reappeared in London shortly before bombs began falling on Great Britain in '39. Jack attempted to claim the baby but was rebuffed by Peggy's mother, Margaret, as Peggy wasn't at home at the time. Rather than waiting, Rosemberg disappeared, his impatience and urgency surely affected by the pervasive communal feelings of impending doom fast engulfing all of free Europe.Distraught, Peggy, like many young British and American women, went to work in a munitions factory. She raised Terry with Margaret's help. Peggy then entered into a rebound affair with a factory coworker. This led to another pregnancy, this time a daughter. Unable to care for both children on her own, she gave the child over to foster care when she was three months old and continued to make bombs and nurse her broken heart. In many ways, Peggy never got over Jack Rosemberg. He was \"the one that got away,\" and this sentiment would foment a resentment that would compromise the peace and optimism of Peggy and John's second-chance home on Stansfield Road (especially after Terry grew into a ringer for his estranged biological father).Compared with the Burns family, David's father was from relatively stolid genetic stock. John's influence surely had a calming, even a saving effect, on Peggy and David in both the postwar years as well as the increasingly chaotic 1960s, when David rebelled against his class and station and struggled to find success as a singer and songwriter. John's father, Robert Haywood Jones, was a boot maker, and his mother, Zillah Hannah Jones, worked in an industrial wool mill. She died when he was very young. John was sent away to private school and like many British children of his age, he was subjected to a brutally strict rearing full of emotional suppression and harsh punishment for dissent. As a young man, he lost his crippling shyness in the dark of the local cinema. Jones, whose features in photos seem much more pinched than those of Peggy, as if he's constantly straining to avoid saying something troubling or rebellious, became a great fan of escapist films, English music halls, American jazz--anything that temporarily relieved him of his painful diffidence. When his father passed away John inherited a trust of three thousand pounds, to be paid out on the day of his twenty-first birthday in the fall of 1933. Jones decided to parlay the funds into a career in the entertainment business and some kind of permanent relief from his painfully quiet life. He left Yorkshire for London and fell under the wing of a fast-talking Irish would-be music hall impresario named James Sullivan.Sullivan was married to a mysterious Italian performer who was said to have perished before a live audience during a circus stunt gone wrong. His blond daughter Hilda was confident and socially engaging, a showbiz kid with a head full of yellow curls. She played the piano, sang, danced an...",
