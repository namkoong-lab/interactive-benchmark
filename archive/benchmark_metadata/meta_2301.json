        "\"Two Sides Of The Same Coin\" may sound cliche, but it is far from being typical. This a tale of two individuals by the names of Malik and Nicole. The book is divided into male and female parts to archive their experiences involving love and relationships. The book is a series of poems that tell their stories throughout their relationships involving first acquaintances, the \"getting to know you\" phase, and many more from both the male and female perspectives. Through the book, the reader will be taken on a journey throughout the relationship of a man and a woman through their eyes, but everything isn't perfect in paradise. These two stories describe how every connection developed with a person will either add or take something away from your life. Love can be beautiful, but don't be naive to it's deceitful ways."
