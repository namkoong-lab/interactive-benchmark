        "\"Estrangement is at the heart of Nancy Roberts' Crossing the Great Divide. In this collection of intricately linked short stories, Roberts braids and stitches together the tales of a core group of friends, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, lovers and pals, all of them literally and figuratively, brought together and divided. A seriously ill character, Grace, says to her sister, Joy, \"Please let me talk about what's happening to me.\" Our job is to pay attention to what is said and to understand what is not said. Our doing so as readers of these stories is a pleasure because Roberts' prose is remarkably deft. The voices in these stories are often wry, even in the midst of sadness; the language is always refreshing. Roberts' great gift here is that if we do listen closely we will hear ourselves.\"  Darrell Spencer, author of Caution: Men in Trees, winner of the Flannery OConner Award.",
        "\"Crossing the Great Divide is a marvelous collection of stories. In each story, Nancy Roberts shows an astonishing understanding of men and women. She is fearless in going deep into each character. This is writing marked first by superlative care and attention. But these stories dont sit and wonder, they bring wonder to muscular episodes of loss and renewal; they capture hope when it is fragile and when it is strong. This is very fine fiction which is both thoughtful and dramatic.\"  Ron Carlson, author of Plan B for the Middle Class, selected as one of the best books of 1992 by the New York Times"
