        "Shabazz The OG started his career in the music business in high school as a rapper and radio station intern. From there he propelled into promotions, artist bookings, road management, and― ultimately project management and consulting. Shabazz always felt his life, and means of support, would revolve around the entertainment industry. But as we know, \"Sometimes we don't find our purpose. Our purpose finds us.\" Much to his own surprise, Shabazz discovered that his purpose in life is to give― by way of offering his life's experiences and collected wisdom, to those who know him or not. Shabazz has used social media as a vehicle to delve into the lives of people who needed to hear his messages. At times that proved to be critical. For others it was simply refreshing to hear someone echo their same sentiments on where we stand as a culture and society.From his platform, Shabazz has entered the community and spoken in over 15 facilities and institutions to date. He has been the featured guest on numerous interviews. His aim is to continue sharing, motivating, encouraging, uplifting, and educating. He remains available to instill morale, confidence, and accountability to all whom he encounters along his journey.What's his formula? TRUST, LOYALTY, and CONSISTENCY",
