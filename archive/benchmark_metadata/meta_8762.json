        "Finn and Company are back! In this sequel to MAN UP, sports agent Patrick Finn’s newest client extraordinaire is none other than Svetlana Takitov, the rising Russian tennis star and aspiring fashion model. But this one needs loads of attention and a seemingly bottomless bank account, as she intends to become nothing less than a world-famous, socialite diva. What Finn desperately needs is for Takitov to qualify for the next tournament, a task that becomes all but impossible when a Russian thug is found dead in her condo—death by mango pit—and Svetlana goes on the run. Enter Finn. In a bid to protect his agency’s investment, Finn enlists his trusted partner Nikki O’Callahan—along with Svetlana’s publicist, and her hair stylist—and tracks the part-time athlete to a paradise island halfway across the globe. Before they have time to grease up for the beach, though, they're all embroiled in a battle between Svetlana and a pair of Russian hitmen. Now with more help than he cares for, it’s up to Finn to ward off the killers, save Svetlana, and get the hell out of Paradise."
