        "Review",
        "\"As the seasoned author of 15 successful cookbooks (e.g.,",
        "Art of the Slow Cooker",
        "), Schloss does not disappoint here. This collection contains 200 recipes for carbonated beverages, ranging from the expected (Rooty Toot Root Beer) to the gourmet (Spiced Balsamic Fig Sparkler). In addition to the soda recipes, Scholss devotes two chapters to food cooked with the drinks, covering both savory main dishes and sweet desserts. The short descriptions that accompany each recipe are carefully written to communicate taste and mouthfeel with vivid accuracy. Whenever possible, drink recipes have a range of options including carbonating with a siphon or even mixing into a cocktail. VERDICT The retro fonts and stylish layout make this book a modern answer to Stephen Cresswell’s 1998",
        "Homemade Root Beer, Soda, & Pop",
        ". Accessible to novice soda makers and appealing to experts, this is an exceptional collection and a comprehensive resource for both kitchen and bar.\"",
