        "A fun re-telling of the Christmas story for young children, including regular invitations to make some noise!",
        "Some people think that Christmas was a \"Silent Night\". Far from it. It was filled with shouting, singing and screaming! It was as noisy as any of our Christmas celebrations.",
        "This fun and fresh retelling of the Christmas story comes with invitations to make some noise, so that children can join in as parents read to them. But it also shows children that at the heart of the Christmas story is something we should all be quiet and see: God’s Son Jesus was born, so that we can be friends with God forever.",
        "A wonderful Christmas gift for children aged 2-4."
