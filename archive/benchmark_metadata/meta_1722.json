        "MORNING COFFEE CUP: Wake up with your morning coffee and a complement. Start off the day with a dose of caffeine in the AM. Start your day off right with dark coffee and some motivational encouragement printed on either side of the mug, so you can see it and the rest of the world can too. MAKE SOMEONE SMILE GIFT: Make someone you love smile every time they have a hot beverage. Remind them that you love them, but not in that sappy best dad ever kind of way. Black text on clean white ceramic makes for a clear message. Give it to your mom, dad, daughter, sister, boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, or best friend for her birthday, his graduation, or any other occasion where gifts and a happy little chuckle are appropriate. STURDY CERAMIC: Our classic white ceramic mug is built to stand up to the daily use we know a well-loved mug receives. Plus it's dishwasher and microwave safe because anyone using this mug is too awesome to spend time washing dishes or waiting for water to boil on the stove. SCRATCH RESISTANT PRINT: We use the finest ceramic and our images are imprinted using a Dye Sublimation process that makes the print a part of the mug. SATISFACTION : If our inspirational quote or design doesn't make you or someone you know smile (or the mug breaks or is damaged in shipping etc. etc.) we'll refund you. WhyBecause you're awesome. 11-ounce Standard-sized Mug with an Awesome Design on Both Sides of it!!"
