        "At Scriber Lake High School, we believe that listening is one of the loudest forms of kindness, and that healing begins the moment a person feels seen and heard.",
        "For seven years, Scriber students have been writing about deep emotional pain, and for seven years, Scriber staff have been trying to improve how we listen to them. We have processed and shared unimaginable traumas as a community, raised our consciousness, and increased our collective empathy. Over a seven-year period, our school has become a place where all stories are welcome, and many students have chosen to make their stories available to the world with the hope of providing healing to others.",
        "This year, the Nahui Ollin Aztec transformation cycle provided a deeper intentionality and metacognition to our writing process. Each writer was asked the guiding questions; our job was to listen as they analyzed their experiences, then reflect back what we heard. Through this process, they learned to listen to themselves and discovered a wealth of self-knowledge about their own placement within the cycle.",
        "As a result, there's a ton of courage in this book. Courage to heal. Courage to transform. Courage to gain vision.",
        "So, listen, these writers wrote these stories for themselves. They are publishing them for you."

        "Review",
        "These stories remind us that each and every student can succeed, regardless of zip code, skin color, native language, gender/gender identity, immigration status, religion, or social standing. We thank these brave students for touching so many in our community by opening up and sharing their most private struggles.",
        "--Dr. Kristine McDuffy, Superintendent, Edmonds School District",
        "Writing is a path to mutual understanding. The honesty and strength that comes through in these stories gives me hope that we can continue to learn from each other. The Scriber Lake writers embody what Ray Bradbury said: \"Let the world burn through you. Throw the prism light, white hot, on paper.\" --Maria Montalvo, columnist, Edmonds Beacon",
        "Book seven is the best volume yet of this highly recommended series for your personal library. Ten authors pen personal examples of the value of learning from past experiences, planning our future and targeting our goals. These writers demonstrate that focused, courageous action overcomes fear.",
        "--Bob Fuller, Rotary Club of Lynnwood",
        "I can think of no better way to teach students than to have them craft and publish their own stories. After including student voices and the Scriber books in my classroom for six years, I know that storytelling unites and heals us. This writing program should be part of every school's curriculum.",
        "--Stacy Wright, teacher-librarian, Edmonds School District",
        "These students have woven their resilience into the fabric of the entire school community. We",
        "must read these stories so that we can foster a collective consciousness.",
        "--Karen L. Mikolasy, professor, University of Washington",
        "About the Author",
        "Marjie Bowker has taught at Scriber Lake High School for twelve years out of her twenty-one-year teaching career. She landed at Scriber after teaching in local general education positions and at American International Schools in Norway, China, and Vietnam for nine years. She did not intend to stay at Scriber long; however, she quickly fell for the honesty of the students and soon realized she had found her place. This is the seventh book she has compiled and edited with Scriber writers. Marjie is the author of a curriculum guide, They Absolutely Want to Write: Teaching the Heart and Soul of Narrative Writing, and a book based on the concepts of Appreciative Inquiry, Creating a Success Culture: Transforming Our Schools One Question at a Time.Leighanne Law, Scriber Lake High School's teacher-librarian, earned her BA in English from Carleton College in Minnesota and has used her degree to build a career out of reading and talking about books. After many years working as a bookseller and event coordinator, she realized that the best part of her job was connecting youth to the glorious world of reading. In 2013, she went back to school to earn her MA in Teaching from the University of Washington and then jumped right into their library endorsement program. One of her professors at the UW told her about this amazing little alternative high school that was looking for a new librarian and in 2014 she landed the best job in the world. She is honored to be a part of this school's community of storytellers."
