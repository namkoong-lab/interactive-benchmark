        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "\"Hot diggety!\" exclaims plump Mole when he sees the full moon for what is apparently the first time. And indeed, the moon is at its most fetching, glowing in the cobalt-blue night sky \"like a bright silver coin.\" Mole spends the balance of the book engaged in sweetly comic attempts to pry the moon out of the sky. His woodland pals try to warn him off the plan, each one pointing out, \"It's not as close as it looks.\" But that doesn't stop Mole from trying to leap for it, poke it, knock it down with acorns or simply grab it from a high tree branch. Finally, it dawns on him: the moon's beauty lies in the fact that everyone can enjoy it (and besides, Mole now notes sagely, \"It's NOT as close as it looks!\"). Author and artist seem ideally paired for this well-traveled but sweet tale. In Emmett's unadorned, gentle prose, Mole never seems the least bit avaricious he's just genuinely enchanted by the moon's ethereal beauty. As was true in her Down in the Woods at Sleepytime, Cabban's creatures radiate genuine affection for one another. Keeping the detailing in her settings to a minimum there's just enough to provide a proper stage for Mole's pratfalls Cabban lets the luminescence of the sky and moon hold center stage. It's easy to see why Mole is so thoroughly captivated. Ages 3-6.",

        "reS-K-Mole is mesmerized by the beauty of the full moon and tries to bring it down from the sky, but jumping up and down, swishing a stick, and throwing acorns fail to knock it from its place. Rabbit, Hedgehog, and Squirrel all shake their heads and tell Mole to give up: \"It's not as close as it looks.\" But the little creature persists, climbing a tree to get closer. He falls from its limb into a puddle, where he sees the moon's reflection floating. But when he touches it, the moon breaks into pieces and disappears. Devastated, he thinks he has destroyed it forever. His friends point out that it is still up in the sky and Mole is joyous, finally ready to leave it in its place. Dark blue skies and a glowing moon exude peace and serenity in this sweet book. Preschoolers will sympathize with Mole's attempts and sigh with contentment when they realize he has not ruined the treasure. The onomatopoeia scattered throughout makes this an appealing read-aloud. A pleasant, quiet offering.",

        "Ages 3-7. This funny fable about an overreaching little mole delivers a reassuring moral for contemporary kids who want \"the moon.\" One night, when the ground and leaves are brightly tinged with silvery moonlight, Mole emerges from his hole, is moonstruck and decides that he wants \"that shiny thing\" in the sky. He jumps to get the moon, pokes at it with a stick, and then throws acorns at it, much to the amusement of his forest friends. When Mole shatters the moon's reflection by falling in a puddle, he's afraid he's destroyed the beautiful orb. His friends show him that all is still well and that some things are best enjoyed as they are. The comical, thought-provoking story gets a lift from Cabban's sweet art, which occasionally uses vertical panels to create a great cartoon effect.",

        "Jonathan Emmett intended to end this story with Mole building a tower to the moon, until his three-year-old son, Max, pointed out that it would be far easier for Mole to climb a tree instead. (Max also thinks that Mole would have gotten the moon—if only he had chosen a taller tree.) BRINGING DOWN THE MOON is Jonathan Emmett's first book with Candlewick Press.Vanessa Cabban has written and illustrated several books for children, including BERTIE AND SMALL AND THE BRAVE SEA JOURNEY and and BERTIE AND SMALL AND THE FAST BIKE RIDE. She is also the illustrator of DOWN IN THE WOODS AT SLEEPYTIME by Carole Lexa Schaefer. She says, \"Mole's story touched me because he takes on an enormous task and triumphs in his own way. I wanted him to be a role model we can all love and relate to.\"",
