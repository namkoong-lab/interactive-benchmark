Tightly knit and perfectly finished, they're warm but breathable: the perfect winter hat for women and men.",
        "Alpaca - The Royal Fiber of the Incas",
        "Alpaca fiber comes from the alpaca, an animal like a llama that lives at high altitudes in Bolivia and Peru. Its lustrous, silky feel sets it apart from other fibers, and during the Inca Empire (1200 AD - 1532 AD), only the royal family could use clothing made of Alpaca.",
        "Why buy Alpaca?",
        "Alpaca is a rare fiber with limited production. It is warmer, softer and far more durable than wool. Due to its long fiber length, alpaca will never pill. Your Alpaca item is an investment that will still look beautiful many years after its purchase.",
        "Alpaca is a Socially Responsible Fiber",
        "Alpaca is an ecologically sustainable \"green\" fiber. Alpacas graze freely as they have for millenia. The husbandry of alpaca sustains rural families in the highlands of Peru, enabling them to stay in their traditional homes.",
        "How to care for your Alpaca clothing:",
        "Alpaca is not delicate. Care for exactly like wool. Hand-wash in cold water or dry-clean.Lay flat to dry. Store neatly folded - do not hang. Store in a moth-free environment.",
        "With this care, an Alpaca item will stand up to years of everyday usage with few signs of wear.",
