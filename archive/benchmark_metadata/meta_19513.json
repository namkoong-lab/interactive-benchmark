        "Wealthy, retired judge Justin Playfair (George C. Scott, The Day of the Dolphin, The Hustler) has a most peculiar eccentricity: he believes he is Sherlock Holmes. Betrayed by his scheming brother, “Holmes” comes under the care of psychiatrist Dr. Mildred Watson (Joanne Woodward, The Three Faces of Eve, Paris Blues). As Watson follows Holmes through Manhattan on a search for his elusive nemesis Moriarty, the unlikely pair are drawn into a world of danger and intrigue. Together, they discover an uncommon reality—and a most magical love. Three years after the film The Lion in Winter, director Anthony Harvey (Grace Quigley) and screenwriter/playwright James Goldman (Robin and Marian) reunited for this classic romantic comedy. The amazing cast includes Jack Gilford (A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum), Al Lewis (TV’s The Munsters), Rue McClanahan (TV’s The Golden Girls), Kitty Winn (The Panic in Needle Park), F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus) and M. Emmet Walsh (Blood Simple). They Might Be Giants is presented in a special expanded version, featuring additional footage not seen in the original theatrical release.Special Features:-Expanded Edition - Featuring additional footage not seen in the original theatrical release -Audio Commentary with Director Anthony Harvey and Film Archivist Robert A.
