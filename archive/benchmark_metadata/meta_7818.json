        "(2011):   In the 45 years that I have been teaching reading to students with dyslexia, I'm always looking for reading material to back up that which is provided by the program, which my students can use to practice reading on their own or at home with a parent's guidance. Many publishers have sets of \"high-low\" books intended for older readers with limited reading skills but these do not follow the principles of the Orton-Gillingham-based reading programs - systematic, highly structured, recursive in its presentation of skills taught, and with progress predicated on mastery of the current level of skills being taught. Now, Pam Brookes has created DOG ON A LOG Chapter Books that follow an incremental, phonics-based pattern and work well with the Wilson Reading Program as well as other O-G based programs. These wonderful little books have \"chapters,\" so that students feel that the books are a bit more sophisticated. Another advantage of these books is that they have just enough pictures to increase interest in the stories but not so many as to allow the reader to get the story from the pictures. Reading is necessary. Ms. Brookes has also created DOG ON A LOG Let's GO! Books. This complementary set of books tell the same stories with more pictures and less text. These books allow for skill practice in a format which may be less intimidating for some students until they feel confident enough to approach the chapter books. Ms. Brookes' books will be a great asset to educational therapists, parents, and special education teachers in their work with children and adults with dyslexia.",
        "From the Author",
        "My child needed an ongoing supply of progressive phonics books that use an Orton-Gllingham approach. This proved to be a nearly impossible, expensive task.I decided to put my talents to use and simply write books for her. She is learning to read using an Orton-Gillingham approach. These books follow a gentle progression of phonics rules. DOG ON A LOG Books have five books at each step to allow for practice, repetition, and enjoyment.I want to share our books with new readers and their families. I also want to make them affordable. Since every family will have different needs and different budgets, I am making the books available in both digital and paper editions. They can be purchased as individual books or collections of five same-step books in one volume. Paperbacks have black and white images. They are optimized for dyslexic learners with cream colored paper and Verdana font. The digital books all have color pictures. As our reading journey progresses I will continue to write books for my daughter and to share them with other families.I was not going to include artwork because drawing is not my talent. However, my daughter was adamant she wanted her books to include pictures. I am grateful to the artists who have made their images available for public domain uses. These sweet images give my daughter a break when the reading is challenging.I hope other new readers will be entertained by these stories as they practice, and master, each step of their reading journey. Pam Brookes",
