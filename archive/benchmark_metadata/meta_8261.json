        "When New York Police Detective Jack Reeves is called to the local newspaper office to investigate a reporter's murder, he discovers that the victim was once his wife Ashley's colleague at The Chronicle. Immediately, he recalls that the man's reputation was less than stellar. Fortunately, Jack and his partner, Ryan Parks, can utilize Ashley's connections to compose a list of possible killers. Frank Finnegan's ruthless, cavalier persona left most of the people entangled in his professional and personal affairs news sources and subjects, friends and rivals with reasons to want him dead. Before Jack can dream of taking Ashley on an overdue vacation, he and Ryan must comb the city to track down each of the aggrieved suspects who populate the headlines of Finnegan's final days."

        "New York police detective Jack Reeves really wants to go home, where his family awaits the beginning of their much-needed vacation. Before that can happen, he gets called to the offices of the Chronicle to investigate the murder of reporter Frank Finnegan. Jack and his partner, Ryan Parks, have plenty of suspects: Finnegan’s co-workers, rivals, friends, sources, and big shots accused of corruption in Finnegan’s stories. It turns out that Finnegan was a ruthless reporter, willing to go to any length to get a story, with no regard to collateral damage. Jack’s wife, Ashley, a former Chronicle reporter who stays in touch with the staff, provides useful inside information as the detectives methodically build their case. Readers will get a good taste of routine police work as well as revealing looks at both the seamy side of local politics and the always awkward relations between media and local government. This is Danielewski’s eighth mystery featuring Reeves. --Barbara Bibel",
