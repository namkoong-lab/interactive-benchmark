A bluejay stands on the path to a thatched cottage in Call of the BlueJay by Caplyn Dor. With colorful flowers lining the path and swans in the pond to the left, this highly detailed image is sure to please! This interlocking jigsaw puzzle made of quality, thick recycled paperboard and is 27x20” finished. It is packed in a sealed plastic bag with very low puzzle dust. A full color poster sheet is included for easy reference as you relax, kick back and enjoy mentally traveling to a simpler time while you assemble this colorful puzzle! About the Artist: Caplyn Dor is an award-winning fine artist and graphics illustrator. Coming from an artistic family contributed greatly in forming the artistic building blocks for Caplyn’s art career. As a child, she often went fishing with her father and then watched him paint beautifully-engaging country scenes from memory upon his return. The artist also watched her mother, who was a gifted ceramist, create beautiful figurines through the modeling of clay and was overjoyed when allowed to help her mother paint them. These are some of the many influences that the artist had upon her life in directing her along her artistic path. Caplyn Dor tends to see beauty on the most miniscule scale and uses this in every way within her work to create a feeling of wellbeing and to bring the viewer to a very pleasing and serene place. Caplyn credits her talent mainly to her strong faith and love of God. She can be found working on her art at home in Western New York with her wonderfully supportive husband, Ken and her cat, Isis."
