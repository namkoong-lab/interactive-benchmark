        "As a starry-eyed child, I wanted to believe my shining prince would ride up on a white horse, present a diamond ring, and carry me away to his castle. His love would be endless and our lives would be the happily ever after all girls dreamed about. I never knew the fairytale was nothing more than a lie.I was a good girl.Until one night, one tiny trip, one little mistake, one moment of indiscretion.When I fell down the rabbit hole, I stumbled into the absolute fantasy, succumbing to their whims and rituals. As their very naughty girl, I embraced the nightmare and refused ever to leave.The Darkland is mine.And those monsters will kneel before their one true Queen."
