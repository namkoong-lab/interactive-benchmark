        "Frankie Mason is dead. Even though his murderer has been caught and sentenced, Frankie’s only son, James, is unable to cope with the permanent scar left by witnessing his father’s brutal death. No matter what lengths he would have to go to, James will have his revenge.",
        "Crescent Earth is the first book of this sci-fi series, opening with the first intentional murder of a human committed by a sentient android. Piloting a time traveling spaceship, James pursues his father’s murderer, infiltrating Martian moon bases, breaking into solarpunk glass cities, and fighting his way through underground military facilities.",
        "Now, as the truth of his father’s murder finally seems within his reach, James is finding revenge and time travel itself a little more than he had asked for. Would he be able to carry out his plans for vengeance, even knowing he should? After all, as the mysterious Dr. Haywood Williams says, history has a way of preserving itself."

        "Review",
        "\"Crescent Earth harnesses a diverse narrative rich with family and love whose beats evoke iRobot and 12 Monkeys. The longing for home experienced by young James juxtaposes against an inevitable wedge of predestination that splits his reality. As we time-travel on both a journey and return through his past, history reveals itself and reflects on humanity. Neither moralizing nor preachy, Crescent Earth propels us on a voyage of knowing with a chaotic, fantastic middle, and a calming, inexorable conclusion, yet remains volatile until the end.\" - Fish Phillips, Author of The Last Minder Fasten your seatbelts because Crescent Earth is a wild, mind-bending, page-turning journey through space and time as Jimmy Mason attempts to unravel the mystery of why an otherwise peaceful, sentient android killed his father. — Sherman Morrison, author of When Willows Weep",
        "\"A smart Sci-Fi mystery that goes places you won't be prepared for.\" - Dave Cook, comic book author (Killtopia)",
        "Remember when conspiracies where harmless fun and explored the idea of Chewbacca-like creatures in the woods, shadowy organizations, and potato-quality photos of mysterious spheres in the sky? While the former two things aren't in this story, it's refreshing to see Ilia take the familiar and reinvent itself by redefining the UFO. Crescent Earth is a great example of how time-travel in fiction is not to be used as a crutch for escaping the ramifications of actions and consequences, but instead to serve as a reminder that our actions do have consequences.\" - Sean Mullen, author, DontFeedthewolf.com"
