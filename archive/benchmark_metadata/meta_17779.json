        "The PS 2. 0 Saddle is the updated version of the popular ISM \"Road\" saddle. It features 30-series foam and gel padding for comfortable support, and is ideal for triathlon, time trial, and road bikes. Similar to the other PS series saddles, the PS 2. 0 has a slight upward slope at the rear, providing superb hip support when your body is rotated forward in the aero position, or an aggressive road riding position. This is often preferred by athletes that don't move around on the seat excessively while riding, making it a worthy choice for triathletes and time trialists who ride in the aerobars, or for flat courses in which the athlete likes to 'settle in' to one position and go. Like all ISM saddles, the PS 2. 0 is nose-less and designed to remove pressure from soft tissue, ensuring maximum blood flow and no numbness, and therefore a more enjoyable ride."
