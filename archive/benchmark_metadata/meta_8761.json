        "I love learning about the faith. It was this type of book that helped me enter the Catholic Church in Easter of 1999. I kind of wished this was published back then, but Chris likely wasn't born yet. There are so many misunderstandings and stereotypes about Catholicism. Chris Sparks tackles them one after the other. Whether you are a recent convert, looking into the Catholic faith, a cradle Catholic, or some random person checking religious books out, this has a lot you can get your teeth into. Keep enjoying the journey. - Chris Padgett, author of",

        "Christopher Sparks has given us a gift: a testimony to the goodness and beauty of Jesus Christ, still present in His Body, the Church, and still giving His gentle and moving grace in this dark age. When so many inside the Church hide His face and so many outside the Church can therefore not see Him, Chris Sparks bears witness as an apostle should. - Mark P. Shea, author of",

        "About the Author",
        "Christopher Sparks has a BA in history and philosophy from Gonzaga University, and an MA in theology from Franciscan University of Steubenville. He has written for Catholic Exchange, Lay Witness magazine, and various publications by the Marian Fathers. He blogs at attheturnofthetide.blogspot.com\r \r Sparks' interest in defending the Catholic faith began as an attempt to find out whether or not it was true. The best way to test it seemed to be to hear the objections of those who attacked it and then to find out if there was any response. After years of pursuing such objections, he came to the conclusion that it was true, largely based on the two points identified by Cardinal Ratzinger as the only two real defenses of the faith: the witness of the lives of the saints and the tremendous contributions of the Catholic Church and her members to human culture."
