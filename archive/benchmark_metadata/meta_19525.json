        "Like reading and writing, drawing is a fundamental life skill. Once an integral part of a traditional education, knowledge of drawing deepens your understanding of the visual world that surrounds you. Contrary to what many people think, the ability to draw does not depend on innate talent or a unique gift. In fact, you may be amazed at how well you can learn to draw, especially with the right instructor. The 36 video lessons of How to Draw offer you dynamic and comprehensive training in the art of drawing. Your teacher, David Brody, brings more than forty years of study, studio work, and dedicated teaching to this course, demonstrating an inspiring teaching style and limitless insight into the learning process. This brilliantly designed course takes you step by step through all of the key elements that together build the integrated skill of drawing. This is your opportunity to master the primary skill of visual art, an ability with rewards you will treasure for a lifetime.",
