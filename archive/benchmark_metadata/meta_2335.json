        "She's beautiful and so damn feisty. I don't know how she ended up with a$$hole she was with, but I'm here now and I'm going to help her. I can't have her though. She's damaged. She hides behind a tough exterior, but deep down, she needs some serious help. Help that I don't know how to give. And now she's wrapped up in this mess with Reed Security and we're on the run together. I knew she would be tempting. I knew I couldn't just walk away. Damsels in distress are my thing. I want her so much, but not until she deals with her past. Only then will I make her mine.",

        "Ugh, I hate men that think they need to save you. Jackson is like that. He thinks I need someone to coddle me and talk things through with me. But what I really need is a man to take me and make me his. In a positive way, of course. I've done the other way and it wasn't fun. But I'm not a wallflower. I know that bad shit happens. I also know that I just need to move on. I've never been one to dwell on the past, but Jackson doesn't want to hear that. He wants me to heal. I wish he would listen to me when I tell him I just need some sexual healing."

Some of my favorite titles are Pride and Prejudice, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Horatio Hornblower. I started writing when I was trying to come up with suggestions on ways I could help bring in some extra money. I came up with the idea that I could donate plasma because you could earn an extra $500/month. My husband responded with, \"No. Find something else. Write a blog. Write a book.\" I didn\\'t think I had anything to share on blog that a thousand other mothers hadn\\'t already thought of. I decided to take his challenge seriously and sat down to write my first book, Jack. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed writing. From there, the stories continued to flow and I haven\\'t been able to stop. I hope my readers enjoy my books as much as I enjoy writing them. Between reading, writing, and taking care of three small kids, my days are quite full.']}"
