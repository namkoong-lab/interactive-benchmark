        "A week-long stay in a creepy Connecticut mansion is replete with hidden passageways, disappearing corpses, and quirky inheritance recipients. And if that’s not enough to make for hair-raising moments on the secluded, storm-bound estate, how about a ghost named Fred?",
        "The stipulation in the will of Jill-Jocasta Fonne’s aunt reads: if a guest leaves early, his or her share will be divided among those remaining. The first one to leave - permanently - dies just hours after arriving.",
        "Soon, people start dropping like flies. Donning amateur sleuth caps, Jill and her associates, Rey and Linda, attempt to solve the mystifying murders. Others jump in, and the bumbling and stumbling - and mayhem - begin.",
        "Praise:",
        "★★★★★ - \"Will keep you amused - and guessing - from beginning to end.\""

        "About the Author",
        "Tyler Colins is a writer of fiction and blog posts, and a sometimes editor and proofreader of books, manuals, and film/television scripts. Fact-checking and researching, organizing and coordinating are skills and joys (she likes playing detective and developing structure). She aims to provide readers with smiles and chuckles like the ever-talented Janet Evanovich and the sadly passed and missed Lawrence Sanders, the -coziness- of Jessica Fletcher, and a few diversions and distractions as only long-time pros Jonathan Kellerman and Kathy Reichs can craft.",

She has always held a love for America; it's been her dream to reside there since the beautiful Stars &amp; Stripes caught her eye at age of five. As an only child born to older parents from lands far away, Imagination served as a playmate for many years. “She” inspired Ty to become a writer, but it was only recently that Inspiration nudged her to get out in the world and promote herself and the “The Triple Threat Investigation Agency” cozy-with-a-bit-o'-grit mystery series.\"]}"
