        "Pink Earth Lichen, responsibly harvested from our own woodland property in Northern Maine. Pink Earth Lichen (or \"candy lichen\") is a fructose lichen, scientific name \"Dibaeis Baeomyces\", and is from the Icmadophilaceae family. These lovely pink treasures like to grow on coarse sandy or clay like soil and mostly prefers to be in in full sun. Your Pink earth Lichen will arrive on a approximately 2\" section of sandy/claylike soil (this could be 2 sections totaling 2\") nestled in a 2 oz plastic lidded cup, packed with soil to prevent breakage during travel. Tin Roof Treasure offers only the highest quality natural craft, gardening and floral supplies, all harvested right here in Maine."
