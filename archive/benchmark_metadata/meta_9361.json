He exhibited Siegfried-related pieces with French sculptor Christophe Charbonnel in 2015. His “Siegfried “has also been produced as a video performance set to Wagner's music performed by the Orchestre National de Lyon.\", 'His new ongoing series is his most personal work to date. In Castle in the Stars, he draws on Jules Verne and nineteenth century romanticism to create a watercolor world of adventure and wonder, to enchant adults and younger readers alike. A special exhibition on this series was produced in 2017 by the Angoulême International Comics festival, showcasing 70 pieces of original art along with costumes, props and models.', 'His works have been translated in 19 languages.']}"
