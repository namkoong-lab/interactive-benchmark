        "About the Author",
        "Tambra L. Eifert knew at a relatively young age that she would one day be an author. She always could create stories with real and fictional characters, presenting lessons to be learned and problems to be solved. Tambra's style of writing is somewhat different from other authors in that she can start with just a word or phrase, a detail or event, or even an inspirational thought, and like a seed, it magically grows into a story. Tambra resides in Topeka, Kansas with her two dogs and bird. Earning a Ph.D. from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, she serves as a faculty member teaching geology courses at Washburn University."
