        "The Sandwich Generation. With our life expectancy becoming longer, more people are finding themselves smack dab in the middle of raising their children and parenting their parents. Heather Davis is no different. With her mom's debilitating stroke one early March morning, Heather and her sister found themselves navigating the new road as caregivers. In Davis's signature silliness, she chronicles her mother's recovery and the merging of her past family and her present family under one roof. Her stories will not only have you holding your sides with laughter, but inviting your own parents to live with you. Or maybe not."

My first book, TMI Mom Oversharing My Life is a number 1 best seller, and it has led the way for three more TMI Mom books: Getting Lucky, Crazy on Board and Girlfriend Rules. My fifth book Life With Extra Cheese, chronicles my life in the sandwich generation--my mom moved in with us, y'all! My latest series was kicked off with Sundays at the Fields, thoughts and devotions for busy softball families. When I’m not jetting off to NYC to appear on national talk shows (okay–it’s only been one show), I live in Oklahoma with my very patient husband, Brian, and our two crazy daughters. The nuts don’t fall far from the tree. Come visit me at www.Heather-Davis.net\"]}"
