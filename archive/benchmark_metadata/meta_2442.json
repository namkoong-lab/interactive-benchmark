        "Corruption. Secrets. Betrayal.Knowing the number of people I can trust is limited. Not uncommon for an heir to the key of Enclave. I should understand it. Be used to it. Expect it. But somehow I’m still blindsided when I find I’ve dedicated my life to a lie. To what extent is the proof of our sins buried? I’m not sure. Only as more time passes, I’m worried I’ll never learn fact from fiction. It’s why I’m taking my place within our brotherhood. Not out of obligation, but as a cover to get what I desperately need.The truth.The only thing standing in my way? A six-foot asshole in Armani with sapphire eyes and a heart of ice and stone. He despises me on principle alone. He’s a distraction I crave but can’t afford. Yet I doubt the hatred he carries is actually for me. Which makes me want to melt his cold, callous demeanor more. And when I catch a glimpse beneath the surface, I find I’m not the only one searching for answers to unspoken questions.Or keeping secrets.**These Vile Secrets is an enemies-to-lovers MM romance and is the first book of five in the Enclave series. This is a true series and must be read in order. This is Roman's story. This is diving into dark romance and there will be triggering content."

She believes home isn’t a place, but a feeling, and it’s one she gets when she’s chilling lakeside or on hiking trails with her dogs, camera in hand. She’s addicted to all things photography, plants, peaks, puppies, and paperbacks, though not necessarily in that order. Music is her love language, and traveling the country (and world) is the way she chooses to find most of her inspiration for whatever epic love story she will tell next!', \"Join CE Ricci's Reader Group here! https://bit.ly/3TQJMt3\", 'Facebook: @authorcericci', 'Instagram: @authorcericci', 'CE Ricci is represented by Two Daisy Media', 'For all subsidiary rights, please contact Savannah Greenwell: info@twodaisy.com']}"
