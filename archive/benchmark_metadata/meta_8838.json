        "Simone Martel's beautifully cultivated garden stories range from the humorous, the tale of an errant water lily, to the profound and unexpected, how inspiration and hope can come from working in a tomato field. Each tale is a verdant-themed treasure and Martel's the perfect storyteller to bring in the harvest. --Sandra Knauf Editor and Publisher, Greenwoman Magazine Author of Zera and the Green Man",
