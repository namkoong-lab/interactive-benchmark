        "it could be the bug edition of Ranger Rick",
        ". The back of the book has comparison charts to help identify eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. It would make a great home reference book for any kid interested in bugs.  - Kaylee from Goodreads In awe filled photography we are able to see complete life cycles of insects and spiders from eggs to larvae, pupa to adult. This is by far one of the most interesting bug books I have ever read. It also includes a top host and nectar plant guide, comparison guides for each stage of the life cycle, and briefly touches on plant and soil life. Detailed descriptions and photographs make this book interesting even for those who aren't overly fond of insects. -- Melanie Schemanski (melanieski.blogspot.com)\"For all aspiring entomologists, or even just plain nature lovers, this book should be part of your library.\" --Aron Row (citybookreview.com)The entire book is filled with amazing photographs that will delight readers of all ages.  Each of the sections about the insects has wonderful basic information with pictures of the different stages of the insect. The brother-sister author team has brought the mysterious world of these little critters to life. And this book is a great way to start to learn about insects whether you are 5 or 55. This book is an excellent book for children, grandchildren, a favorite teacher or a favorite gardener.-- Donna Donabella (GardensEyeView.com)",

We live in northern Kentucky just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati. We enjoy teaching others about flower gardening, nature photography and butterfly life cycles.
