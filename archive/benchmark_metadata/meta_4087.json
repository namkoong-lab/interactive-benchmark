        "From the Manufacturer",
        "The Energy Star TCP 801014 14-watt SpringLight is a perfect fit for just about all energy efficient lighting applications. It's medium base and compact height fits anywhere a standard incandescent fits and saves up to 75-percent in energy costs compared to similar light output incandescent lamps. Ideal for hard to reach places, the 27K SpringLight's 10,000 hour runtime lasts 10-13 times longer than incandescent and its End of Life logic guards against non-passive failures. TCP's world class phosphor insures the lamp's 900 lumen output and excellent lumen maintenance. TCP SpringLights meet FCC consumer limits and are UL approved for enclosed fixtures 23-watts and below. The TCP 801014 14-watt SpringLight is covered by a 12-month warranty and is sold one item per package. TCP is the home of lighting innovation and offers one of the largest selections of Energy Star-approved products. The TCP SpringLight line saves energy and money as their lowest price-marked series of lamps."
