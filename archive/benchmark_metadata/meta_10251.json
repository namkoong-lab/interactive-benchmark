        "Amazon.com",
        "In explaining the title of his fourth recording, Ray Lynch writes in the recording's liner notes that it \"refers to the inexplicable feeling of headlessness. What is left when there is no thinking? Just the body, feeling, being, enjoying.\" Make of that what you will, keeping in mind that the phrase (plus three other song titles) come from the writings of spiritual guide Da Avabhasa. As for the music, it involves Lynch (classical guitar, harplike keyboards) and a handful of musicians from the San Francisco symphony (violin, cello, and assorted horns get the most exposure) cultivating a gentle soundtrack for the vision of rapture playing in Lynch's imagination. For anyone not fully tuned into Lynch's wavelength, it is generally an unremarkable journey that nevertheless offers some pleasant moments, particularly the opening, quietly melodic journey for guitar (\"Over Easy\") and the Western guitar twang Lynch slips into the soft classical latticework of \"Mesquite.\" Lynch has a following, as evidenced by the enthusiastic consumer reviews that accompany this offering. If you, as a mainstream music listener, intend to join it, bring only modest musical expectations.",
