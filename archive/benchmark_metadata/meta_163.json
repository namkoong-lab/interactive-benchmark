    "description": [
        "The wedding vase is a symbol of unity between a bride and groom. The first step to creating this piece is to cover the bowl in horse hair. As it is being fired, the hair melts into the pot to create each unique pattern. Then the piece is hand painted and etched. A beautiful accent to your home or a thoughtful gift. This purchase allows Native Americans to continue to be employed in their trade. Due to the nature of handmade items, colors and designs may vary slightly. A card explaining the story of the Wedding Vase is included with purchase."
