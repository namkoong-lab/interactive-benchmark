        "About the Author",
        "Dale Reich, also known as \"Bumpa\" to his four grandsons, is a retired teacher who lives in Wisconsin. He enjoys reading books to children as well as writing and illustrating them. Dale believes that one of the greatest gifts that a parent can give his or her child is to read them a bedtime story every night. \"It was the best part of each day as my children were growing up,\" he says. \"I just wish I could go back and do it all over again! I hope my children feel the same way.\""
