        "Deluxe edition includes six additional tracks. 2013 release from the multi-platinum Southern California quartet. Reborn is not only their first independent release outside of the traditional label system; it's also their first to feature drummer Dylan Howard [Unwritten Law] and co-production by longtime friend Matt Thorne. Holing up in a studio with Thorne, Trapt began to prolifically crank out songs. The record's first single 'Bring It' served as the catalyst, sparking a veritable flurry of creativity."
