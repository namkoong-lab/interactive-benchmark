    "description": [
        "This silicone O-ring is red in color, round in shape, has a durometer of 7OA, and is designed for use in a wide variety of sealing applications. Silicone is acceptable for temperature applications between -76 degrees F (-60 degrees C) to 437 degrees F (225 degrees C). It has good resistance to ozone, weather, detergent, salt water, engine and transmission oil, non-petroleum brake fluid, hydraulic fluids that resist fire, vegetable and animal oils, and high molecular weight chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. Silicone is vulnerable to mechanical wear and tear, water and steam over 250 degrees F (121 degrees C), aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene), chlorinated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene), acids and bases, and hydrocarbon fuels. O-rings commonly provide a pressure and fluid seal between cylindrically shaped, overlapping mating surfaces and are commonly seen in engines, faucets, flanges, valves, and various cylinders. They are circular in shape, with a round cross section and a hole in the center, similar to a doughnut. O-rings are available in a number of sizes, and can be ordered based on required nominal inside diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and cross-sectional (CS) diameter. This silicone O-ring has a shore durometer of 70A. Shore durometer is the hardness of a material, and its resistance to permanent indentation. A higher durometer value indicates greater resistance to indentation on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no indentation. This silicone O-ring meets standards defined by Aerospace Standard AS568A, which is the Aerospace Size Standard for O-rings."
