        "How should Christians respond to war? This age-old question has become more pressing given Western governments' recent overseas military interventions and the rise of extremist Islamist jihadism. Grounded in conservative evangelical theology, this book argues the historic church position that it is inadmissible for Christians to use violence or take part in war. It shows how the church's propensity to support the \"just wars,\" crusades, rebellions, or \"humanitarian interventions\" of its host nations over time has been disastrous for the reputation of the gospel. Instead, the church's response to war is simply to be the church, by preaching the gospel and making peace in the love and power of God. The book considers challenges to this argument for \"gospel peace.\" What about warfare in the Old Testament and military metaphors in the New? What of church history? And how do we deal with tyrants like Hitler and terrorists like Islamic State? Charting a path between just war theory and liberal pacifism, numerous inspiring examples from the worldwide church are used to demonstrate effective and authentically Christian responses to violence. The author argues that as Christians increasingly drop their unbiblical addiction to war, we may be entering one of the most exciting periods of church history.\"This book is not a political theology, nor is it a proposal for government action. It is both a heart cry and a biblical case for the church to be the church in living out the gospel of peace. And Nick gives us countless moving examples of what happens when faithful Christians live by this gospel in fearful and challenging situations; this is biblical theology contextualized in real life.\"--Nick Ladd, from the foreword\"Sadly, violence continues to be a recurring decimal in our world today. What should be an appropriate Christian response to violence? Dr. Nick Megoran argues in this book that Christians ought to promote peace rather than war. This is what it means to be the church and to be Christian in such a world as ours. I strongly recommend this book as a very helpful resource for navigating the intricate biblical and theological pathways to resolving the issues of violence, war, and peace.\"--John O. Enyinnaya, Associate Professor, Systematic and Biblical Theology,Nigerian Baptist Theological Seminary, Ogbomoso \"With a cloud of witnesses from Europe to the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Americas, Dr. Megoran's reasoning and examples in his powerful book recover the true mission of the church: to stand unflinchingly against the brutal turbulence of our age and to act with 'gospel peace' regardless of the odds. We desperately need this reminder!\"--Jeffrey Brown, an architect of the \"Boston Miracle,\" an anti-violence effort in the United StatesNick Megoran is Honorary Chaplain and Lecturer in the School of Geography, Politics and Sociology at Newcastle University, England. His undergraduate and postgraduate studies were conducted at Durham and Cambridge (England), Roskilde (Denmark), and Osh (Kyrgyzstan). The author of numerous articles and books, including The War on Terror: How Should Christians Respond? (2007), he has researched war, violence, and peace around the world."

I'm a political geographer at Newcastle University and also Minister of Wallsend Baptist Church.\", 'Political geography is the study of how we divide the world up between ourselves: how and why we draw borders between each other, and how we think about the world geopolitically as divided between certain types of people and places. It looks at what happens as a result.', 'It is also the study of what we can do to overcome those divisions and make a more peaceful world.', \"My writing explores this. It draws on political geography and international relations theory, on theology and on philosophy. I'm particularly interested in what it means to treat people as proper human beings in a variety of locations, including international borders. My work is informed by field research around the world, particularly along the Uzbek-Kyrgyz and German-Danish borderlands. I have also conducted field research in Israel-Palestine and Turkey, and on human value and the workplace in the UK.\", 'I use this work to think about some of the big questions we face as human beings - questions about meaning, purpose, value, suffering, death, religion and how to live life well.']}"
