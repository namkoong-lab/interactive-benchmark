The APA is the largest scientific and professional organization of psychologists in the United States, with over 118,000 members. The Publication Manual is used by all writers, researchers, editors, students, and educators in a wide variety of disciplines, so this clarification has the potential to significantly expand the use of inclusive language.” —",
