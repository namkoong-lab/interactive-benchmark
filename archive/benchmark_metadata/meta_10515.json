        "Philadelphia rock band Beretta76 was founded in 2003 by Camille Escobedo, Pete Rydberg and Rob Giglio (Creem Circus). Black Beauty is the 2006 full-length follow-up album to the band's debut eponymous EP. The album captures the band's melodic rock & roll glam-punk intensity drawing comparisons to The Runaways, Cheap Trick, Ramones and Suzi Quatro."
