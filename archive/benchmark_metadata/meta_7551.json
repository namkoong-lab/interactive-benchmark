        "About the Author",
        "Dennis Manoloff has been a sportswriter at",
        "The Plain Dealer",
        "since August 1990. He covers primarily pro sports. He has written on more than fifteen sports/activities, including cricket and curling. He has covered two World Series, several PGA and LPGA championship events, the NBA Finals, MLB and NBA All-Star Games, and the NFL playoffs. He was on the field and hit by a bottle during the Bottlegate game at Cleveland Browns Stadium in 2001.",
        "Among his beats was professional indoor soccer; the Crunch won three NPSL titles in the 1990s. Because pro indoor soccer does not count as a major sport, Dennis, who grew up in Bay Village, Oho, and graduated from Bay High School, has not seen a Cleveland team win a championship in his lifetime. He once coached former Browns punter Dave Zastudil, a Bay High graduate, in baseball.",
        "In 2001, Dennis, a Northwestern University graduate, wrote a twenty-five-piece",
        "Talkin Baseball",
        "series that ran weekly during the season.",
        "The Plain Dealer",
        "nominated it for a Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism.",
        "In 1998, he attempted to break the Guinness world record for most bowling pins knocked down in twenty-four hours. He fell woefully short but still managed 29,000 in twelve hours while raising several hundred dollars for charity."
