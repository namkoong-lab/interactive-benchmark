        "Life Changers is comprised of century-old stories of men who had their lives changed so profoundly and so dramatically that the original book was reprinted 12 times. Now 100 years later, with its 13th printing, this precious classic is set to change the lives of many more men and women. The words in this book are as true today as they were then. Life Changers is also about a man, Frank Buchman, who was first and foremost a teacher. Buchman could change the lives of students and scholars in the course of a single conversation; changing those lives so profoundly and persuasively that the world was in disbelief. Buchman started a movement that reached the shores of America and lives today in the form of many 12-step programs. While the original movement was founded on Christianity, its principles and ideas moved beyond religion and Christianity into a more generic spiritual movement."

        "About the Author",
        "Carl \"Tuchy\" Palmieri was born in 1942 in an old mansion belonging to the former mill owner of the factory where his father worked. His family was one of six related families that occupied the mansion. The second son of Italian immigrants, Carl grew up in Westport, Connecticut. After receiving a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Bridgeport he began his career marketing and installing accounting computers for the Burroughs Corporation. Twenty-one years later, in 1987, he started his own computer business. Carl is also the author of a series of self-help books. Today Carl lives with his wife, Susan, in Fairfield, Connecticut. He has three children, two stepchildren, and 12 grandchildren. His nickname, Tuchy, comes from having been one of three Carls in his family. There was a \"Big Carl,\" a \"Carl the Twin,\" and \"Carluch,\" which meant \"Little Carl.\" \"Carluch\" evolved into \"Carlatuch,\" \"Tuch,\" and finally, \"Tuchy.\""
