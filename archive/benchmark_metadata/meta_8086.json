        "Review",
        "This book, Muhammad for the Global Village, is authored by Dr. Muhammad al-Haashimi al-Haamidi, the highly-educated and brilliant media man, whom we know from watching on the al-Mustaqillah channel to be a man of culture and conscience, whose main characteristics are honesty, responsibility, respect and high values. This book is a worthy volume which combines sweetness of words, seriousness of content, careful selection of ideas and authentic documentation. Hence this work of Dr. al-Haashimi deserves to be widely accepted and he is deserving of great respect for the sincerity of his intention and the soundness of his method. --Dr. 'Aa'id al-Qarni, A well-known scholar and writer from Saudi Arabia"
