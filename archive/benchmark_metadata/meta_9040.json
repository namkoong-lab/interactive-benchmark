        "David Bruenger provides readers with a basic framework for understanding the relationships between the artist and audience and the producer consumer by examining the methods underlying creation-production-reception and creation-consumption-compensation. Each chapter offers a different perspective on the processes and structures that lead listeners to discover, experience, and interact with music and musical artists. Through case studies ranging from Taylor Swift’s refusal to allow her music to be streamed on Spotify to the rise of artists supported through sites like Patreon, Bruenger offers highly relevant real-world examples of industry practices that shape our encounters with music.",

        "is a critical tool for giving readers the agile knowledge necessary to adapt to a rapidly changing music industry. Graphs, tables, lists for additional reading, and questions for further discussion illustrate key concepts.   Online resources for instructors and students will include sample syllabi, lists for expanded reading, and more."

Bruenger . . . has written another very useful book for those seeking a framework for understanding those changes. . . . The underlying theme of the book is that music is not just about making and spending money but also about experiences that can change people's lives.\" ―",
