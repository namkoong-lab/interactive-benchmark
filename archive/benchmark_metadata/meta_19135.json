        "D.N. ½ inch white plumbers Teflon tape or thread seal tape is a simple but highly versatile thread sealant, used primarily in ductwork and piping applications. PTFE stands for polytetrafluoroethylene. It is essentially a long strip of synthetic polymer film sold on a spool. One key material characteristic of this Sealant Tape is the fact that it is water-repellant. This makes thread Tape incredibly useful for a wide range of plumbing and pipework jobs - which is why you will find a thread seal tape of some kind in almost every well-stocked pipework or plumbing too. Thread Tape plumbing stop leaks, water Sealant Tape is Perfect for showerheads, Pipe Sealing, and Pipe Threads.
