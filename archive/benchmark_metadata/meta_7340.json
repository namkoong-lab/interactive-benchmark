        "Review",
        "The Visconti Devils is an original fantasy romance novel about anartist dedicated to painting tarot cards, who falls deeply in love with a museum curator. He shows her a rare 15th century Visconti tarot deck,from which the card of the Devil is missing - just as it is missing from every other known copy of the ancient deck. Obsessed with finding themissing card because The Devil is the one card she cannot decide how topaint, the artist and her love embark on a quest to Italy in search ofthe secret; yet a far larger scheme of events is unfolding around them,one that will thrust them into a desperate struggle between the forcesof light and darkness. An engaging and atmospheric novel of love,adventure, and the darker side of the search for creative inspiration. -",
        "Midwest Book Review",
        "The book The Visconti Devils is a wonderfullook into the Tarot and the forces of good and evil. I really enjoyedreading about Maggie and her drive to find that last card and howMichael was willing to help her in her endeavor. Both Maggie and Michael were people who had very strong characteristics, which made them bigger than life. Ms. Dimitra brought the city of Milan to life and made mewant to visit during Carnevale. The sights and sounds had me feelinglike I was on another vacation. I can't wait to see what Ria comes upwith next.I give this book a 5 because the characters and placeswere so real. I could step into the pages of the book. The world camealive and what was found was very unexpected and different from anything I've ever read. -",
