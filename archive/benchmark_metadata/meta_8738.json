        "seeks to correct this injustice.Phil Sidnell challenges the common view that ancient cavalry were useful for scouting and raiding but left the real fighting to the foot soldiers. In fact, he argues, they were often used in a shock role and proved decisive on many occasions. The famous victories of great generals such as Alexander, Hannibal and Julius Caesar could not have been won without a full appreciation of the battle-winning potential of the cavalry.Drawing heavily on the ancient sources, Warhorse takes the reader on a thrilling ride through numerous vividly recreated battles, from the earliest civilizations to the Battle of Hastings, to reveal the horsemen of the ancient world in their full and deadly glory.",

        "'Wonderful book, you have a very clear and quick-paced writing style. It should become a classic.'",
        "He is US defense intelligence analyst as well as author and editor of many books, including\" Alexander: The Invincible King of Macedonia.\"--Sanford Lakoff'Sidnell offers an excellent account of cavalry's effectiveneess ... and convincingly proves that shock cavalry was decisive in the outcome of many ancient battles. Although his main audience will be academic. his writing style flows well enough to appeal to a more casual audience.' The Historian, Fall 2008--Sanford Lakoff\"Sidnell has produced a highly readable study of the combat role of cavalry in the ancient world. Sidnell nevertheless persuasively argues his points in an imaginative, thorough fashion. Illustrated with 14 excellent photographs and drawings (seven in color) and a helpful glossary, though lacking battle diagrams and a bibliography, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers.\" Summing Up: Highly recommended.\" -CHOICE, July 2007--Sanford Lakoff\"Throughout the book the sources are discussed and the reliability we can place on them is evaluated with reference to current academic thinking and archaeological research...an interesting and informative read... would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the period\"--Sanford Lakoff\"Warhorse will be a profitable read for anyone interested in ancient warfare, or in horses.\" -Albert A. Nofi, New York Military Affairs Symposium Review, 2009\"The ancient world opened with Homer's heroes riding into battle on chariots and ended when the Arabs' fleet mounts overran the Persian and much of the Byzantine empire. Sidnell charts a clear course across these centuries, and beyond.\" Reviewed in BBC History Magazine, 2008Title mentioned in Church Times, 2008.",
