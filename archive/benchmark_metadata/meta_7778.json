        "Jessie Bluefeather Holgrave is thrilled when her best friend Ellen gives birth to an adorable baby girl. She'd love to find a great man like Ellen's husband, Mike, and settle down but the past has taught her to be wary of men--especially men in uniform.",
        "So when Mike arrives at the hospital with flowers and a new co-worker in tow, Jessie decides she's not interested. However, Marsh Abbott, a Texas Ranger, is blond and blue-eyed, and Jessie can almost picture him in the role of husband, in spite of her fears.",
        "Marsh is immediately struck by the raven-haired beauty before him. He'd like to get to know her, but she doesn't seem interested. Yet he is both patient and persistent. Marsh wants to prove that he's worthy of her, even though he is a lawman.",
        "When his job takes him away and into danger, Jessie is both surprised and frightened by the depth of her feelings. Will Marsh be able to prove himself to her before she closes him out forever?"

A year later I joined Romance Writers of America and discovered all I'd done wrong!
