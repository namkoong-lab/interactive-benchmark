When Paul gets killed on the job, Choice and an inexperienced Bay Area reporter, Linda Maldonado, begin looking into the puzzling circumstances of the murder. As they work together to unravel the intricate threads of lies and half-truths, they discover that his death might be linked to an older, more personal one - the mysterious death of Allen's father some twenty years earlier.With his self-described \"philosophy of removement\" as his frame of reference, Choice searches for the hidden, long-buried answers, only to be outmaneuvered at every juncture. Against this backdrop of violence and deception, Choice soon discovers secrets that alter his understanding of his father, of his family - secrets that lead him to a buried history of betrayal."

        "\"That I am a nobody doesn't bother me as it might some people.

        "Despite the bang with which it starts, this is no action thriller rocketing along; instead it's a tortuous journey of discovery by its Korean-American protagonist and narrator, Allen Choice. Separated from his family by death and alienation, Choice is a loner and somewhat of a cipherAa 30-ish bachelor, a college dropout, a bodyguard for a private protection service. Everything changes when his partner, Paul Baumgartner, is shot dead while they're on a routine job babysitting a Silicon Valley executive. Choice's introspective, ruminative natureAhis \"dis-ease\" as he describes itAis shaken by this murder and by the Kafkaesque events that follow. Nudged by an aggressive reporter, Linda Maldonado, Choice begins to consider various possibilitiesAthat Paul, not their client, was the targetAor even that he himself was the intended victim. Choice finds his investigation anticipated or derailed at every turn, sometimes violently, sometimes more subtly, but inevitably forcing him to learn more about his heritage and his past, including the death of his father when he was only 10. Chang's intricately constructed plot moves easily from the minutiae of protecting a client to the cultural rootlessness affecting his hero. Choice's dual journeyAof self-discovery and the uncovering of his partner's killerAmakes for an absorbing blend of literary novel and crime thriller. (Feb.) Forecast: Chang's first two novels drew critical acclaim upon their publication by Black Heron; the second, Dispatches from the Cold, has been optioned for film. With the greater marketing muscle of HarperCollins behind himAincluding a four-city author tourAChang could break out with this title, especially if the option translates into a feature film.

        "Korean American Allen Choice (nee Choi) is an operative for a Silicon Valley executive protection company. He's been doing the work for several years and finds it engaging. That's a good thing because Allen doesn't have much of a life outside of work: single, no family, few friends. While bodyguarding a CEO, Choice's partner is shot in the head by a drive-by motorcyclist. In the aftermath of the incident, Choice's life becomes far more complex. He learns that his partner was moonlighting and that his death--not the CEO's--might have been the cyclist's objective. He also learns that the death of his father two decades before might be connected to his partner's death. And he meets a young Latina journalist who shares his suspicions and makes him realize how lonely he is. Chang's novel works well on several levels. It's good intrigue, it's skillfully written, and it's highly readable. Allen's search for the truth ultimately takes him on a compelling journey aimed at understanding himself, his family, his past, and his future.",
