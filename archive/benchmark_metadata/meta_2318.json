        "If you're looking for a family drama filled driven by suspense with emotionally compelling characters, CHASING AMANDA will reel you in. One child murdered, another missing. Potentially lethal small town secrets revealed.Dealing with parenting, a mother's love, and trusting one's faith--CHASING AMANDA comes at you at breakneck speed and just a touch of the paranormal.***Nine years ago, Molly Tanner witnessed a young girl's abduction in the busy city of Philadelphia, shifting her occasional clairvoyance into overdrive. Two days later, the girl's body was found, and Molly's life fell apart. Consumed by guilt for not acting upon her visions, and on the brink of losing her family, Molly escaped the torturous reminders in the city, fleeing to the safety of the close-knit rural community of Boyds, Maryland. Molly's life is back on track, her son has begun college, and she and her husband have finally rekindled their relationship. Their fresh start is shattered when a seven-year-old girl disappears from a local park near Molly's home. Unable to turn her back on another child and troubled by memories of the past, Molly sets out to find her, jeopardizing the marriage she'd fought so hard to hold together. While unearthing clues and struggling to decipher her visions, Molly discovers another side of Boyds, where the residents--and the land itself--hold potentially lethal secrets, and exposes another side of her husband, one that threatens to tear them apart.CHASING AMANDA has the emotional draw of a Jodi Picoult book, with the family drama and suspense of Lisa Scottoline."

        "From the Author",
        "I began writing Chasing Amanda in 2006, set it down to write Megan's Way in 2008, and revisited it in 2009 with even more subplots in mind. The idea came to me while running solo down White Ground Road, which is mentioned in the novel. Much of the landscape and architecture mentioned in the book is true to Boyds, and is just as foreboding in the dark of night as it is portrayed in Chasing Amanda. Boyds, however, is not a town where any of these events have taken place, nor are the people likened to residents of the small town. I tend to write about my worst fears, and, as you will read, this touched on the one that scares me the most. I hope you enjoy the story.",
