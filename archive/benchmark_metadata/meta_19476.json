        "There is one vibratory source that connects all things. It has been called Akasha, the primordial OM, the music of the sphere, Indra's net of jewels, and a thousand other names throughout history. The ancient teachers taught Nada Brahma; the universe is vibration. The vibratory field is at the root of all true spiritual experience and scientific investigation. It is the same field of energy that yogis, mystics, saints, Buddhas, shamans and seers has observed by looking within themselves. Many of history's monumental thinkers such as Pythagoras, Tesla, Einstein, Kepler, and Leonardo DaVinci, have come to the threshold of this mystery. In today's society most of humanity has lost this ancient wisdom. We have strayed too far into the realm of thinking, and lost our connection to our inner worlds. This balance- what the Buddha called the middle way, what the Taoists called the balance of Yin and Yang, is the birthright of every human being. It is the common root of all sciences and all religions, and the link between our inner and outer worlds. International version includes narration in English, French, Spanish, German, and Hindi. Subtitles in English, French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Polish and Swedish."
