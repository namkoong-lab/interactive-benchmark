        "From the reviews of the second edition:",
        "“It is designed to teach analytical mechanics to second and third year undergraduates in the UK, and probably to third or fourth year undergraduates in the US. … This book offers a very attractive traditional introduction to the subject. … the author is well tuned to the difficulties even strong students encounter. … discusses the relevance of classical mechanics in modern physics, especially to relativity and quantum mechanics. This is a fine textbook. It would be a pleasure to teach or to learn from it.” (William J. Satzer, The Mathematical Association of America, March, 2010)",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "Analytical dynamics forms an important part of any undergraduate programme in applied mathematics and physics: it develops intuition about three-dimensional space and provides invaluable practice in problem solving.",
        "First published in 1987, this text is an introduction to the core ideas. It offers concise but clear explanations and derivations to give readers a confident grasp of the chain of argument that leads from Newton’s laws through Lagrange’s equations and Hamilton’s principle, to Hamilton’s equations and canonical transformations.",

        "Aimed at second- and third-year undergraduates, the book assumes some familiarity with elementary linear algebra, the chain rule for partial derivatives, and vector mechanics in three dimensions, although the latter is not essential. A wealth of examples show the subject in action and a range of exercises – with solutions – are provided to help test understanding."
