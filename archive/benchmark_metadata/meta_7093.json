        "Dirt. It's in the air, under your bed, on the street and between your toes. Most of the time, you're trying to get rid of it. Does showering make you feel squeaky clean? Sure you are -- for now. Read this book to find out why you just can't escape dirt -- and why it's important for more reasons than you think. Earth, mud, grime, soil -- whatever you call it, dirt is everywhere, even where you don't expect it. Did you know that without dirt there would be no rain? Or beautiful sunsets? The Dirt on Dirt covers not only what you think of as dirt, but also everything on and around the planet relating to dirt, from dirt homes big and small to secrets the dirt hides and much more. Youngsters will also find a bucketful of fun things to do with dirt, including how to build a bike racetrack, create fossil footprints and grow a garden playhouse."
