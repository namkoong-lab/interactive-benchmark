        "Hyacinth Martin is a vivacious American woman who wants her freedom to enjoy London and travel the world, but her father has other ideas. Hoping to control the situation and redirect her father, she hires an actor (or is he an actor?), to play the part of a Duke. Hallie mistakes Sebastian Stainton, eighth Duke of Ashford, for his twin actor brother and hires exactly the wrong (or right) person to play the role in her deception. Sebastian has no plans to marry until he meets a saucy, red-headed vixen with a spunky American attitude who tempts him to do the only devious thing he's ever done in his life. An assassin hired to force Hallie's father to sell his oil refinery to John D. Rockefeller complicates everyone's plans. It is a story of love, intrigue, and delicious deception."
