        "The Heinakroon LED Patch Cables for Eurorack are perfect for patching your modular system or semimodular synths. The highquality semitransparent patch cables have colored LEDs in each connector powered by the signal voltage, making it very easy to see what's going on in a patch. 3.5mm jacks, compatible with Eurorack Our LED CV patch cables are fully compatible with the Eurorack standard 3.5mm mini jacks. The cables are coated in a semitransparent soft rubber that makes them easy to handle for convenient patching. Dualcolored LED lights Each jack has a builtin LED that lights up when a signal is going through the cable. Jack 1 shows a red light for positive voltages and a green light for negative, while jack 2 has green for positive and red for negative. This makes it extremely easy to see what kind of signal that's being passed through the cable which is useful for diagnosing complex patches. 23.6 inch cable length The LED patch cables are 23.6 inch (60cm) long and work well within a small to medium sized modular system. For smaller patchbays and modules closer together we recommend our 11.8 inch (30cm) cables instead. Diagnostics or education The Heinakroon LED patch cables will make it easy to see what's going on within a patch. This is perfect for both diagnostics or education, thanks to the intuitive guiding provided by the LED lights. Perfect for the stage LED patch cables makes it easy to patch your synths even in dark conditions, like on stage or in a darkened studio. The flashing LEDs will also add a certain flair to your performance, highlighting the rhythm of your music with red and green lights across your patch. Dimensions: Plastic connectors: 7/16 inch (11mm) in diameter, 2 inch tall including cable fold Cable: 23.6 inch (60cm) long, 0.16 inch (4mm) in diameter What's included? 5x LED CV Patch Cables"
