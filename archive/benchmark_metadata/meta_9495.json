        "From the Author",
        "Everyone knows Old MadDonald's Famous Song but not everyone knows Noah's version... which I should think MUST be the original version, don't you?",
        "(ARK DISCLAIMER: Sally Lloyd-Jones has never sailed in an actual real life ark herself but she's pretty sure-with all those days at sea-the animals must have sung songs to pass the time and probably if this song had been invented back then, it would have their favorite.)",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "The rain is falling fast on Noah, and this time the animals refuse to stay quiet! With an Oink! Oink! here and a Quack! Quack! there, everyone files into Old MacNoah’s ark (two by two, of course) to escape the rising waters. The ride may be bumpy, but it’s filled with plenty of Ee-i-ee-i-o excitement!  Get ready for the flood of sound effects and beautifully illustrated animals created by Sally Lloyd-Jones and Jill Newton. With the help of the classic “Old MacDonald” lyrics, this favorite Bible story gets a fabulous new twist that’s perfect for sing-along fun.",
