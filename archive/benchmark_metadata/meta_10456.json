        "Each appearance of Atsushi Sakai and Christophe Rousset leaves an unforgettable memory with those who have had the good fortune to hear them in concert. Long-standing partners, they now join together for the first time on disc for a composer they revere: the mysterious Antoine Forqueray. Born in 1672 in Paris, he was one of the greatest gambists of all time. Famed for his virtuosic improvisations, he published none of his 300-odd pieces before dying in 1745. Aside from a few handwritten works copied in the collections of other composers, all of Forqueray's music has been lost."
