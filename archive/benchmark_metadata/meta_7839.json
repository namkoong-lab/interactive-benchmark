        "In the chilly half-light of dawn a bizarre Pierrot figure waits in the shadows of a deserted stretch of motorway. The costumed hitchhiker’s victim is a passing motorist. The murder cold-blooded, brutal. Without motive.Doctors at the local hospital Tim and Daisy Sherringham are blissfully happy. The perfect couple.When an emergency call rouses Tim early one morning, he vanishes on the way from their flat to the hospital.And Daisy is plunged into a nightmare of terror and doubt . . . The driver watched, transfixed as the blade moved slowly, inexorably towards him. His hands flew upwards in a desperate attempt to wrest the weapon from the Pierrot’s hands, but the defence was too weak, too late. Before the driver’s fingers even touched the knife, they fell limply, landing with a dull thud on the leather-gloved steering wheel."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Billed as a medical thriller, this generally well-written debut set in England is undone by an almost hysterical plot. Things begin prosaically enough, when Dr. Tim Sherringham is called away in the middle of the night to deliver a baby. When he subsequently goes missing, his wife, Daisy, also a doctor, calls in the police. They find two headless and handless bodies along Sherringham's route to the hospital and hear reports of a man in a pierrot costume in the vicinity at the time when the murders must have occurred. Neither of the bodies turns out to be Tim's. Suspense builds as Daisy waits for her husband's body to be found and the detectives, the gentle Trevor Joseph and the misanthropic Peter Collins, puzzle out the significance of the clown and several other missing-persons cases. John creates a sinister atmosphere, especially in scenes taking place at a crumbling seaside pier, and she clearly knows her way around a hospital. But those assets don't entirely make up for some overly lurid descriptions, a conclusion that tardily details the past and the implausibilities of the far-fetched plot.

        "First novelist John attempts?with varying degrees of success?to amalgamate the best elements of a medical thriller and police procedural. Newlywed Dr. Daisy Sherringham, whose doctor husband is missing, suffers premonitory nightmares that incite police suspicion; however, sympathetic detective Trevor Joseph?a \"hero\" from a female author?acts as a buffer. The discovery of mutilated bodies beside the local motorway tips the balance. Before the story ends, pilfered drugs, murderous mimes, secret love affairs, and medical improprieties inundate the reader. This surfeit of subplots, the shaky premise, and weak supporting characters sabotage an otherwise ambitious debut.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

Katherine the crime writer is a very much darker person than Catrin Collier. Interested in the human psyche, and the motivations behind criminal acts, she is fortunate to count police officers and pathologists among her friends. They have given her insights into their work and the trauma that is part of their daily lives. Trauma that would drive lesser people to insanity - and officers like her creations Peter Collins and his long suffering superior, Trevor Joseph to make highly inappropriate remarks at inappropriate times.\", 'She has given many talks on all her books, creative writing, crime and the actual events that have inspired her. Prisons and prisoners are among her favourite venues and audiences because she learns far more from the inmates than they do from her.', 'Her crime book, By Any Name, written as Katherine John, starring Cengiz Dervis, Samira Mohammed Ali and Dan Richardson was filmed by Tanabi in her native Wales in 2014 and was released on Amazon Prime in 2016. The photographs and video are from the filming.']}"
