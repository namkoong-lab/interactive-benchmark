        "Manual with defroster. Restore a crisp clean look to your C4's interior with one of our brand new 100% correct Reproduction Heater/Climate Control Face Plate Kits. Years of regular use, sun exposure, and cleaning often leaves climate control face plate scratched and faded, print becomes discolored or gets rubbed off entirely. The face plates have been painstakingly reproduced from the type and color of print to the tint of the display lens. There is no reason to pay the high premium for a complete replacement unit or a rebuild service when all you need is a new face plate.
