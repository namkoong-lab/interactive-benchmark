        "Light Rail 3.5 IntelliDrive Motor with switch stop hardware, No Rail version, a genuine Light Rail, quality constructed in the USA and made to last and that is under continuous use. Only Light Rail performs over many years like a workhorse with the power and endurance for any grow light weight. Beware of cheaply made imitations. Details. Light Rail 3.5 IntelliDrive grow light system with adjustable travel distance, travels approximately 4 feet per minute on its Rail, no Rail included, and has a zero to sixty second adjustable time delay for pausing the grow lamp at the ends of each run. This helps promote even growth from end to end and allows for equal light time for the entire run. Light Rail is the only light mover made for continuous duty, will move any grow light weight and it is the single most important way to supercharge our indoor grow light equipment. We get much better yields when our grow lights move because more leaf area is reached with better light, so no hot spots and no shadow patterns. Plus, we cover about 30 percent more area, and that is per grow light. Brand matters and Light Rail is solidly made in the USA by Gualala Robotics since 1986. Light Rail has a sealed instrument grade drive motor you can count on that runs on only 5 watts, advanced digital control circuitry, Extreme Duty Trolley Wheels rated to 60 lbs as sealed precision bearing carrier wheels, and a self clutch drive design with automatic traction control. These features are unique to the Light Rail brand. Light Rail has authentic electrical certifications C CSA US or CE, and flammability ratings UL 5 VB, and is RoHS compliant. Light Rail is unique as it runs at a safe 28 to 42 degrees C with a flame retardant electrical enclosure, as it should be. Solidly constructed and extensively tested, Light Rail 3.5 will move any grow light and multiple grow lights inline per Motor. Made in America Matters. Smart robotics. You can only get this with Light Rail by Gualala Robotics."
