Gabi is a qualified aesthetician and has spent years working in spas around the world, promoting some of the most prominent skincare brands from France, Germany and Spain.

Gabi is one of the kindest and most dynamic women you will ever meet. She takes into consideration all aspects of every situation before moving forward, something that has supported Colin to achieve the success as the visionary behind their business. Gabi resides in South Surrey, British Columbia with two amazing teenage daughters and has just celebrated her 20th wedding anniversary with her best friend, Colin.",
