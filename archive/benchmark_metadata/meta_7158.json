        "With hands on hips and eyes wide open, Dowd surveys gender relations in contemporary settings such as the workplace, the White House, the mall, and the media, comparing and contrasting as she goes. And while her secondary sources are endless--and, let's face it, the subject of gender inequality is not exactly new--Dowd manages to produce a fair share of bons mots. To wit, this pearl on the subject of plastic surgery and men: \"I have yet to see a man come out of cosmetic surgery without looking transformed into some permanently astonished lesbian version of himself,\" Dowd quotes a source as saying. \"It's terrifying. My friend's father had just his eyes done by the best, most highly sought-after cosmetic surgeon in New York City. And he doesn't look refreshed or well rested. He looks like he's being stabbed to death by invisible people.\" Dowd's generously dispersed anecdotes, though seldom as funny, are equally readable. In the end, though, one wishes",
