Over the next few days, as a parade of often irreverent visitors poked and prodded the mummy-like corpse, curious items began to emerge from the ice: an ax with a metal blade, a longbow, finely stitched leather clothing, and--most astonishing of all--boots stuffed with grass.

        "follows scientists into labs and archaeologists into the field as they search for clues to the life and times of a man who lived before the advent of writing and cities. Who was he? Why were parts of his equipment damaged and unfinished? Where was he going? How did he die?",
        "Iceman",
        "is not merely a compendium of data but the story of the forces that produced and shaped them. At times, debates over who owned the Iceman and what should be done with him overshadowed the research. Brenda Fowler chronicles the scientists' squabbles and ego trips and the unexpected twists in the research, including the claim that the Iceman was a fraud and the mystery of his missing penis. Along the way, the authority of science is powerfully questioned and then, largely, reaffirmed in a surprise ending that has already led to a reexamination of the Iceman's final hours and his five millennia in the ice."

        "In 1991, a dead man was found in a glacier on the Italian side of the Tyrolean Alps. How could he have known, as he settled down for a very long winter's nap, that his discovery would unleash a circus of political, scientific, and journalistic shenanigans that would make and break careers and cause international tension? Science writer Brenda Fowler takes a peek at the bizarre odyssey of this incredibly well-preserved frozen corpse in",

        ", covering every step of his transition from Stone Age accident victim to celebrity specimen to museum piece. The cast of characters involved is large and colorful, including archaeologists, smalltime politicians, curators, writers, and even channelers claiming to speak for Ötzi, as he came to be known. Initially taken to Austria and studied there, he was brought back closer to where he was found in northern Italy after years of political and scientific wrangling, though evidence suggests he may have originally come from modern-day Switzerland. Beyond the battles between nationalistic and egotistical players,",
        "Iceman",
        "contains an absorbing examination of the scientific process at work: hypotheses announced and discarded, the accretion of new evidence, and the ever-narrowing range of explanations for the find. The story is far from over, as research continues even as the question of Ötzi's resting place is settled (temporarily?). With luck, we may soon learn as much about our recent ancestors as we recently learned about ourselves.",

        "In September 1991, hikers in the Alps discovered a well-preserved frozen corpse; nearby lay a stone ax and swatches of leather and fur. The man turned out to have died in the early Bronze Age, making him an incalculable treasure for students of early human beings. Fowler, who has covered Central Europe for the New York Times, offers a brisk and easy-to-follow narrative, first of the great discovery, then of the personal and political struggles for control of the frozen body, which researchers eventually nicknamed ?tzi. Her tight and compelling account emphasizes the late-20th century people who acted, investigated and argued the science and law surrounding the man from the past. Fowler's journalistic experience serves her well as she introduces each of the characters: local archeologist Konrad Spindler, who first pronounced the corpse 4,000 years old; Reinhold Messner, \"the best [mountain] climber who had ever lived\"; museum curator Markus Egg; botanist Sigmar Bortenschlager (\"a feisty strawberry blond\"); and a few dozen others. Each gossipy controversy begot others; each scientific answer led to new questions. Should ?tzi be used to help the local economy, displaying him for tourists? Yes, said the government; no, cried the local priest. The scientists were split on the issue. Was ?tzi missing his genitalia? No (though they had \"dried up like a leaf\"); so how did the story that he had been castrated come to be circulated so widely? Archeological and present-day whodunits proceed in alternating steps throughout Fowler's attentive narrative; readers with any interest in early humans, in the politics of scientific discovery or in this region of Europe will want to dig in. 16 pages of b&w photos not seen by PW.

        "In 1991, a frozen mummy emerged from a glacier in Northern Italy after 5000 years. The story of his discovery and the subsequent scientific study form the basis of this well-crafted and articulate book. Fowler's account places the scientific facts within a chronological narrative as it compellingly relays the death of the Alpine Iceman, the excitement of his remarkable discovery, and the tortured journey to understanding and commercializing him. Fowler, who covered the Iceman's discovery for the New York Times, highlights science's intensely human, egotistical, and fallible sides. The lead scientists' extreme measures to control and fund the expensive research and publicity are particularly telling. (Konrad Spindler's The Man in the Ice, LJ 12/94, played a large part in fundraising efforts.) In the end, less is told about the Iceman himself, while much is revealed about the scientific enterprise. Highly recommended as an excellent source for the popular audience and for library collections.",

        "A German couple hiking in Austria's Ötztal Alps in 1991 found a well-preserved body melting out of a glacier. With the remains were a flint-blade dagger, an ax with a copper blade, an unfinished longbow, a quiver with two finished and 12 unfinished arrows, and a pair of birch-bark containers. Ötzi, as the Austrians named him, was a figure from an ancient past--some 5,300 years ago, according to radiocarbon dating. He provided science with a rare opportunity to assemble information about little-known aspects of Neolithic life. Journalist Fowler describes the findings with care. Alas, the Iceman also provided the occasion for a remarkable amount of bickering. The Austrians thought he was theirs, but a survey showed that he lay in what is now Italy, just 101 yards south of the border with Austria, and so he is now on display at a new museum in Italy's South Tyrol. Additional quarrels arose over the manner of preserving the body, the money to be paid for and made from the discovery, and the conflicting scenarios of how the Iceman met his end. Fowler sets all that out, too. She makes an absorbing story of the saga.",

        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "A well-researched and thoroughly fascinating account of the scientific, political, and commercial ramifications following the discovery of a Stone Age man's mummified corpse. Fowler, a New York Times contributor based in Vienna, covered the discovery in 1991, and in the years following has interviewed dozens of men and women connected with the Iceman. From these interviews and their published writings she has constructed a complex tale of how the widely publicized discovery launched a spate of scientific research and conflicting claims, aroused fierce political and academic rivalries, and became the center of a controversial commercial venture. Her account begins with the body's discovery by two Alpine hikers and its botched recovery from the ice several days later. Since the site was at first assumed to be in Austria, the mummy was taken to the University of Innsbruck, where the head of the university's anatomy department placed it in one of his department's freezers and for the next six-and-a-half years controlled access to it. His goal of preservation ran counter to that of researchers pleading for a piece of the mummy, and his plans to commercialize the Iceman led to restrictive contracts governing publication of research results. Artifacts (weapons, tools, clothing, etc.) found with the Iceman were taken to a museum in Mainz, Germany, and put into the care of skilled archaeologists and paleobotanists eager to reconstruct as much of his world as possible. While the scientists squabbled about access and theories, Austria and the largely autonomous Italian province of South Tyrol (in which the find was soon determined to have been located) bickered over commercial exploitation of the mummy. In the end, commerce won out over science, and today, curious tourists can view the Iceman at South Tyrol's new museum of archaeology, where he has been on display since 1998. A lively tale of clashing egos and national pride that reveals more about our own times than the Stone Age. (16 pages of b&w photographs, not seen, map) --",

        "UP AHEAD, still some two hours away, the snow-covered Similaun rose like a huge white sail against the cloudless Alpine sky. The last time Helmut and Erika Simon had stood on this spot, ten years earlier, the trail through the snow to the summit had been easy to pick out. But this summer had been unusually warm, nearly all the snow at this altitude had melted, and the trail had vanished amid the jumble of ice pockets and jagged gray schist that formed the backbone of the Tyrolean Alps. On their previous trip, they had turned around here and headed back down the mountain. But this time, despite the wind they had battled all day, Helmut was determined to reach the summit of the 11,808-foot Similaun. After strapping crampons on their boots, they prepared to cross the Niederjochferner, a massive glacier, the surface of which had the consistency of refrozen crushed ice. The glacier was melting, and the runoff water had bored a network of tiny tunnels and canals into its surface. As they stepped onto the glistening ice, the Simons could hear water gurgling and dripping as it moved through the glacier. It was Wednesday, September 18, 1991. Their day had begun six hours earlier and about 3,600 feet lower in the tiny village of Vernagt in Italy's Schnalstal. Vernagt consisted of a few pretty farm houses and small inns, clustered around the sunny side of a man-made lake. At the crack of dawn, the Simons had pulled on their backpacks for a long day's hike. The route, which led up a steep valley, over the glacier, and up the snowy mountain's flanks to the summit, demanded stamina but no special climbing equipment. Every summer day, a dozen or more tourists reached the peak, one in a chain along the Austrian -Italian border. For the Simons, frequent visitors to the Schnalstal mountains, the path was tolerably challenging. Both in their early fifties, the Simons were practical hikers who had spent the first few days of this vacation on shorter hikes, trying to acclimatize themselves to the high altitude and getting their office legs in shape. They were from Nuremberg, Germany, where Helmut, a cheery man with a bulldog's gait, worked as the custodian of the public library and Erika, a slight and solemn figure, put in her time at the local newspaper's personnel department. For a while, the going was smooth, and they fell into a nice rhythm of small steps across the crunchy expanse of the glacier, which flowed down the northern side of the mountain into Austria's Otztal. Suddenly, they drew to a halt. Two yards ahead, the ice was split by a chasm that ran as far as they could see in both directions and was wide enough to swallow a person. Together the couple inched forward cautiously for a closer look into the wondrous abyss. The solid ice walls of the plunging crevasse were hues of gray, brown, and white and shone like opal or were swirled like some precious, dark marble. How deep it was, or where it led, the Simons could not fathom. Climbing lore was filled with tales of menacing crevasses obscured by snow cover, and the Simons had heard their share. A hiker who inadvertently walked onto snow concealing a crevasse could break through and plunge into the ice. Sometimes, the snow would then fall in and bury the hiker alive. If the victim survived the fall, it might be almost impossible to claw out of the icy trench. Trapped hikers could then die of hypothermia. The risk was real, which was why people who ventured over snow-covered glaciers were supposed to rope up together in a line. If one fell through, then the others could try to pull him out. Since this crevasse was visible, it was not really a problem, although the Simons had to walk parallel to it for several yards before the gap narrowed enough for them to be able to step across it. Again, they turned toward the summit. But they soon ran into another fissure and then another. Somehow they had entered a maze of crevasses. Again and again, they were forced to take long detours, looking for places to cross. When they finally reached the rocky ridge that led up to the summit of the Similaun, Helmut glanced at his watch. It had taken them nearly three hours to get to this point when it should have taken only two, and now the sun was halfway down in the western sky. He realized that they might not have enough daylight left to make it back down the mountain. Erika wouldn't like it, but Helmut knew they could always get a bunk in the drafty old Similaun Hfitte, a rustic Alpine lodge where they had rested for a few hours over lunch on the way up the mountain, and then descend in the morning. As they finally approached the summit, a younger couple overtook them. Minutes later, the four were crowded around the rocky cone of the summit, breathing hard and surveying the Alps of Italy and Austria. If you knew how to stand, you could get one foot in both countries, since the border ran right along the ridge. Helmut asked the other couple to take a picture of him and Erika next to the wooden cross that marked the highest point of the summit. After a short rest, all four set off back toward the Similaun lodge. By the time they arrived, it was nearly 6 pm, and the first stars were already sparkling in the pale evening sky. Accessible only by foot over mountain trails, the timbered, three-story lodge was situated well above the tree line in the nook of a pass over the main Alpine ridge, a stone's throw from the Austrian border. The cramped bunk rooms had no running water, and the toilet was outside. Anyone who had to visit it in the middle of the night faced a miserable dash along the edge of a cliff, guided only by a dim bulb hanging over the door. The Simons, who had nothing but the sweaty clothes on their backs, were not prepared to spend the night away from their cozy bed-and-breakfast in the valley, but Helmut persuaded his wife it was too dark to risk the descent. Anyway, as alpine lodges went, the century-old Hfitte had a lot of character. They could get a hearty meal here, plenty of Italian red wine, and awaken with the sun. The next morning, Helmut rose quickly and went outside to check the weather. The sky was radiant. He stood for a while looking at the sun illuminating the mighty snowcap on a mountain range to the west. The night before, the couple he and Erika had met at the summit had invited them on a climb up the nearby Finail Peak. He knew Erika's first priority was to hurry down the mountain and into a hot shower. But on such a day, and with such good company, he knew he would be able to convince her to make a go at another summit. After breakfast, the Simons and their new friends started on the trail to the Finail Peak, which closely followed the main Alpine ridge. The landscape was lunar in its bleakness. The reddish gray stone that formed the ridge was gradually crumbling away, and the result was an endless sea of uneven rock slabs. Some of these boulders balanced precariously for centuries before finally crashing down on one side or the other of the ridge. Occasionally the trail traversed a field of snow over ice embedded in the broken rock. At this altitude, far above the tree line, real soil was nonexistent. Even at the peak of summer, only a few weedy sprouts found places to plant themselves amid the heaps of stone. Walking demanded strict attention, since a misplaced step could send a person hurtling against a rough boulder or careening down a slope. Shortly after noon, the happy group reached the summit. Toward Italy, they looked down on a boulder-strewn and treeless landscape that merged gradually with the pine forests and then ended in a burst of emerald green and marine blue. These were the pastures and artificial lake at Vernagt. The view into Austria was not nearly as inviting. Though the decline was more gradual, the slopes were draped in deep snow and ice. To the northeast, more craggy Otztal mountains, like choppy waves on a stormy sea, extended to the horizon. As exciting as the panorama was, no one wanted to linger on the narrow ledge, where they were buffeted by gusts coming up from the Schnalstal. The two couples exchanged addresses and then quit the summit. Since the Austrians were headed into the Otztal, the couples' paths soon diverged, and they paused to say warm goodbyes. The younger couple headed down the rocky slope and the Simons turned to canvass the landscape ahead for a marker that would get them on the trail to the lodge. Erika spotted a pile of rocks with a stick coming out the top about one hundred yards away, and the couple began hiking toward it. Known colloquially as a Steinmanndl, or \"little stone man,\" in German, such man-made markers were stacked up every so often, and occasionally planted with a stick, to guide tourists along sections of Alpine trails. A minute later, they reached a low ridge of rock that formed a wall around a long trench. The floor of the trench was filled with melted water, ice, and snow. To circumvent the water, they proceeded to one side, moving along the inside of the trench, over snow and rock. Helmut was walking in the lead when he suddenly caught sight of something dark against the white snow. Just a half hour earlier he had been outraged to see broken glass from a champagne bottle on the summit of the Finail. At first he thought it was just more trash, and he silently cursed the lazy tourist who had done it. But his wife's next words came in the same instant in which he, too, recognized what he was seeing. \"Look, it's a person!\"' Erika exclaimed. Aghast, they halted, steps from a human body stuck in the ice. Instinctively, they veered from the macabre scene and scrambled up four or five steps onto a ledge in the low ridge that nearly enveloped the trench. In the next instant, Helmut sprinted back to try to recall the Austrian couple. After some eighty yards he stopped, yelling their names against the wind. He scanned the landscape below but, seeing no one, he turned and dashed back to Erika, who was still standing speechless on the le...",
