        "Body Weight Exercise Posters - Set of 3 (CBW-SET) from Productive Fitness are 24\" x 36\" laminated wall charts designed as visual guides for upper body, lower body, and core exercises utilizing the body's own weight as resistance. They also provide an informative and easy-to-follow workout routine for those not familiar with fundamental bodyweight training exercises or those not having access to individual or group fitness instruction. The popularity of bodyweight training has skyrocketed over the past few years as an inexpensive way of getting a great workout inside or outside since there is very little equipment required. Not only are body weight exercises fun to do, but they are relatively safe for fitness enthusiasts of all ages and experience levels since there is no risk involving heavy exercise equipment with weight stacks or loose free weights. For advanced exercisers, cross-training routines using body weight resistance are ideal for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and crossfit because they allow for quick transitions from one exercise to another.",
        "The Laminated Exercise Training Poster series from Productive Fitness Publishing illustrates how to perform exercises through clear step-by-step instructions with colorful photos demonstrating proper biomechanical form and start and finish positioning. Each beautiful, easy to follow fitness poster is a great addition to any home gym, office, workout studio, rec center, school gymnasium, or fitness center. Choose a single workout poster or several exercise charts to showcase your favorite workout routines or body focus. Whether you are beginner who has never exercised or used a particular piece of fitness equipment, or a seasoned fitness enthusiast looking for workout variety and a balanced routine, these posters offer a fun, safe and effective guide towards getting fit. Waterproof for resistance against drinking fountain splash, sweat, cleaning supplies. North American Made (Made in Canada)."
