        "Tut: The Story of My Immortal Life",
        "is a funny, fast-paced novel for young readers by P.J. Hoover which chronicles the mischievous adventures of King Tut, now an immortal eighth-grader living in Washington, D.C..",
        "You'd think it would be great being an Egyptian demigod, but if King Tut has to sit through eighth grade one more time, he'll mummify himself.",
        "Granted the gift of immortality by the gods―or is it a curse?―Tut has been stuck in middle school for ages. Even worse, evil General Horemheb, the man who killed Tut's father and whom Tut imprisoned in a tomb for three thousand years, is out and after him. The general is in league with the Cult of Set, a bunch of guys who worship one of the scariest gods of the Egyptian pantheon―Set, the god of Chaos.",
        "The General and the Cult of Set have plans for Tut… and if Tut doesn't find a way to keep out of their clutches, he'll never make it to the afterworld alive."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 4–8—While the basic plot is not new (boy becomes king, greedy uncle kills family to become \"rightful\" king, boy seeks revenge), readers will be pulled into this adventurous story of the young boy ruler and his ordeal. The story begins with Tut explaining how he became immortal 3,000 years ago; his greedy uncle kills his family to gain the throne and Tut is forever cursed to remain a 14-year-old middle schooler. Tut begins his plans for revenge against his Uncle Horemheb and the Cult of Set. The story is set in Washington, DC, where Tut must navigate through the city's monuments and tunnels. He brings along his new friend, Henry, who is much more focused on completing their Social Studies project, which, ironically, is about Tut himself and the funerary box. Readers also meet his immortal brother, Gilgamesh; and Horus, the very humanlike talking Egyptian god cat; and two school mates, Seth and Tia, who are yet to be identified as friends or enemies. Tut also has help from the army of shabtis whose only purpose is to serve him, and though they only stand six inches tall, they prove to be quite capable of protecting their monarch. They also provide a bit of comic relief with their quirky antics. Although the story begins at a rather slow pace, it quickly becomes a fast-moving adventure with surprising twists. The ending is satisfying, with a hint that a sequel may be in the works. The author provides historical notes about the real King Tutankhamen, which may spark an interest in learning more about Egyptian History. Fans of Rick Riordan's \"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\" series (Hyperion) will surely enjoy this title. A fine purchase for libraries where historically based adventures are in demand.—Martha Rico, El Paso ISD, TX",
        "Review",
        "“Tut's struggle to find the peace that has eluded him for centuries and understand whether his immortality is a gift or curse is heartfelt and entrancing, and readers will be eager for his next adventure.” ―",
        "VOYA (4Q 5P M J S)",
        "“Being an immortal 14-year-old pharaoh isn't all scepters and servants; there's also the overthrowing of a homicidal cult--and finishing one's homework…. pyramid history buffs and fantasy fans will delight in excavating.” ―",
        "Kirkus Reviews",
        "“The entertaining premise and fast pace keep this adventure on track, while the way Hoover reimagines the Egyptian pantheon--Isis owning a chain of funeral parlors, for instance--is pleasantly reminiscent of Rick Riordan's work.” ―",
        "Publishers Weekly",
        "“Hoover's fun interpretations of Egyptian gods and goddesses, frenetic pace, and appropriately modern snark propel this highly entertaining adventure. A sequel is a sure thing--after all, he is immortal.” ―",
