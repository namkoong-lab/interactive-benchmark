        "\"This lively, well-researched, and hopeful book is an excellent primer for anyone dealing with TBI and its aftermath, from victims to caretakers. It is clearly written and illustrated for the average reader, but contains information that may be new to many healthcare professionals puzzled by odd and unresponsive symptoms and the realization that time alone does not heal the brain. Conquering Concussion by Mary Lee Esty, Ph.D., and C. M. Shifflett presents history, new research, treatments, and 20 years of clinical case histories. These are real stories about real people struggling with post-concussion symptoms: terrible fatigue, headache and body pain, emotional swings, mental fog, insomnia, weight gain and balance problems. It shows how TBI symptoms overlap with other diagnoses such as ADHD and depression, and reveals the link with PTSD. It features neurotherapy, but presents additional therapies that can aid recovery. Topics include:  Head injuries in history, from Henry VIII to Elvis Presley. What happens in concussion, the many symptoms that may appear, and problems with standard testing and treatments. The origins, supporting research, and results of neurofeedback. Detailed case histories of children, adults, and soldiers with memory problems, severe head pain, insomnia, ADHD and PTSD. Medical issues which may need attention before symptoms of concussion can heal.  The rest of the story: What happened to people in this book who never expected to work or function normally ever again. How they regained their skills, jobs, families and lives.\""

        "Review",
        "Kirkus Reviews (starred review)",
        "Powerful advocacy for an emerging therapy. The authors hook readers by opening with stories about concussion’s impact on famous figures, including Henry VIII, Mary Lincoln, Howard Hughes and Elvis Presley. This eases the transition to Esty’s client histories (using pseudonyms), which are woven throughout chapters that cover what happens physiologically during and after TBI and its manifold physical, psychological, emotional and social consequences. The text is written clearly enough to engage lay readers while still providing the thoroughness and documentation demanded by professionals. They cite more than 300 references, mainly scientific journals and academic books, but they also draw from popular media to keep the discussion relevant and down-to-earth. An eye-opener for anyone concerned about concussion — which the authors persuasively argue should include everyone.",
        "BlueInk Reviews (starred review)",
        "Thorough yet highly readable — rich with explanatory and well-documented details and illustrations that enlighten without overwhelming. Easily understood chapters on all aspects of what happens in brain injury, how it is diagnosed, long-term consequences, and what can help toward its repair. Overall, this impressively penned primer will be a valuable find for a broad audience of professionals, caretakers and those troubled by the consequences of brain trauma who seek to improve their well-being.",
