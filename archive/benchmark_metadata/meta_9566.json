        "The refined rustic style of WRJ, the preeminent interior design firm in the Mountain West",
        "Natural Elegance",
        "showcases the award-winning interiors of WRJ Design, headquartered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and led by Rush Jenkins and Klaus Baer. The firm’s homes are set against the backdrop of dramatic western landscapes from the Rockies to the Pacific. Their interiors are infused with a unique elegance—one versed in the beauty of the wilderness combined with sophisticated contemporary design. Juxtaposing a warm palette with rugged elements, they create homes that have a deep connection to the natural world just outside the windows. Illustrated with photographs by the masterly William Abranowicz, the book features more than a dozen gloriously sited houses decorated in WRJ’s signature rustic yet refined style."
