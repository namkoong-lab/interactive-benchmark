        "Alice has always been afraid of visiting the doctor. Her family is aware of her fear and routinely plans a family gathering to encourage Alice on the safety, need, and even enjoyment in taking her annual trip to see her doctor. The goal of the family meeting is to try and ease her fears and to help her find courage as she anticipates her visit.",
        "Her mom, dad, and brother, Bobby, have all given their best shot at motivating Alice to embrace her doctor visits; none of their attempts have worked. However, on this particular morning, as she prepared for her visit, something different was about to happen. Alice's grandmother is known for telling the best stories and the one she revealed to the family this particular morning changed Alice's perspective on doctor visits forever.",
        "Dr. Richards had grown accustomed to Alice's reluctant visits and was pleasantly surprised to find her happy and enthusiastic about her visit on this particular day."

        "About the Author",
        "Author Manual Ford's passion for understanding and nurturing children's needs began 25 years ago with the birth of his first child. The joy of watching her come into this world, along with bringing her home from the hospital for the first time, still resonates as if it occurred yesterday. Diaper changes and late-night bottle feedings were moments of joy. Having the ability to strongly impact another human's well-being was impactful to him. Over the next four years, he welcomed two more children into the world, which refined his passion as he realized his most gratifying moments occurred while cultivating and teaching his children. The following decade was a whirlwind of sorts. Manual worked various jobs. He also wrote R&B music and traveled the world as a show DJ for platinum recording artists, yet none of this filled the void he felt inside. He constantly wondered what his true purpose in life was. When the opportunity to become an educator for a private childcare facility presented itself, he wasted no time accepting the offer. He didn't know what to expect, but he knew he had a profound love for children. Manual's experience enhanced his ability to recognize the developmental needs of children. Understanding what makes them happy, sad, excited, and mad became easier to assess as he spent more time educating. Finding opportunities to implement those needs was the challenge. Quickly, he discovered that taking popular kids song melodies and changing the words, and creating imaginative stories was the best way to attract and maintain the children he cared for. This unique approach made learning enjoyable while making teaching extremely rewarding. Creating stories that resonate for a lifetime is an important part of this creative process. Not only for children but for parents as well. The main focus of the MEET THE LEARNERS series is to assist in strengthening the family bond. Nothing gives Manual Ford more satisfaction than knowing he assisted in bringing joy, confidence, and stability to families around the world.A lifelong cartoonist, illustrator, and animator, Aaron is one of the sharpest artists in the industry, with a diverse body of work across multiple platforms. In 2008, Aaron graduated from Westwood College in Atlanta, GA, with a bachelor's degree in 2D animation and a minor in Graphic Design. He's also distinguished as the first student from his college to intern at the Cartoon Network. Aaron also worked on and contributed to a few animated series for television. Aaron presently resides in Los Angeles, California, and owns a small multimedia art company, Aaron the Artist LLC."
