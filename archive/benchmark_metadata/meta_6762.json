        "Iron On Clothing Labels- Personalized with Your Name! SPECIFICATIONS ➤Material: 100% Cotton ➤Size:  Samll:1.5\"x0.55\"/3.8x1.4cm Medium:1.85\"x0.67\"/4.7x1.7cm Large:2.48\"x0.9\"/6.3x2.3cm ➤Quantity:  Samll:100 PCS Medium:64 PCS Large:36 PCS STEPS 1. Tear off the name sticker 2. Cut out a small piece of isolation paper (the isolation paper is attached to the back of the name sticker, which can be used directly, or can be replaced with white paper if it is used up). 3. Paste the name sticker on the part to be ironed (before ironing, confirm that the information on the label of the clothes to be ironed indicates whether it can be ironed or not) and cover it with release paper to avoid \"burning\" of the name sticker. 4. Turn off the steam of the iron and adjust it to cotton or high temperature, or 150-160 degrees. Do not use hanging iron. 5. After the temperature is reached, press and hold the name sticker for 20 seconds, move the iron at the same time, and touch the edge of the name sticker with the place with the highest temperature in the center of the iron. 6. After natural cooling, ironing is completed. (After ironing, try scraping the edge of the name sticker with your fingernail. If it can be scraped, it means that you have not ironed firmly, or the ironing temperature, time or pressure may not meet the requirements. You can appropriately increase the temperature and prolong the ironing time. You can reheat it again) KIND TIP 1. The name sticker can be washed 24 hours after it is ironed, and washed at medium temperature; 2. Avoid prolonged soaking or exposure to the sun; 3. After ironing, check the lower corners. If there is a gap between the clothes and the clothes, it is not firmly ironed. You can re-iron (the ironing paper can be reused) 4. If the clothes need to be ironed, please avoid the place where the name is posted;"
