        "Syrah Ceballos has a ship and a plan. All she needs now is a captain crazy enough to follow through. Aurora Osha thought she would never fly again after being drummed out of the Navy. Spearheading an Underground Railroad to rescue slaves from intolerable conditions isn't easy, but somebody's got to do it. Adding to the list of problems, Syrah has made powerful enemies who will stop at nothing to bring her liberators down in a shower of laser fire. Will her strange alien technology and Aurora's leadership skills be enough to deliver their young slaves to freedom?"

        "About the Author",
        "Born in Wyoming, Tina started writing stories in Kindergarten and never stopped. Her love of stories grew as she did, taking her to far off planets and mythic realms of magic and swords. She moved to Washington in 1994 and felt instantly at home in the urban sprawl of Seattle. Her storytelling methods were expanded by a group of like minded fiction enthusiasts she met soon after her move. Today she lives in a large town that thinks it's a city with her husband Luke and son Toby.",

Supporting her writing habit with \"real jobs,\" Tina longed for the days when she could sit down and quietly write for hours. This has left her feeling a little bit guilty about the whole pandemic thing. As usual, life has had the last laugh and 2020 has been the crazy busiest year ever, so that whole being stuck at home thing didn\\'t turn out as planned. Lucky for her, neither has the rest of her life, so she\\'s getting pretty good at adapting.']}"
