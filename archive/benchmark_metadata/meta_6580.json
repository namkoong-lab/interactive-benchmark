        "Rich and Moisturizing Shaving Cream from Haircut & Shave Co. will raise your standards when it comes to shaving cream. Why do you need to use a shaving cream? The natural properties in skin help it to stay moist and supple but as you shave, shaving process can have a harsh effect on skin as the blade is pulled across the hairs, friction is created along the skin's surface leaving it irritated with burning sensation and redness. The much softer skin can be damaged, making the shaving process a little painful. Haircut & Shave Co. Shaving Cream leaves a thin layer of lubrication on the skin’s surface which means less force is needed to drag the blade across the skin. Therefore, the cutting process is clean and smooth instead of being bumpy and choppy, giving you a closer and smoother shave. In choosing shaving cream, look for the one that contains nutrients that you know are good for your skin, ones that will be refreshing and the one that will leave your skin smooth and healthy-looking. Say no more! You can get all that benefits at Haircut & Shave Co. Moisturizing Shaving cream. Like a good quality shampoo or lotion, it contains nutrients that will vitalize and nourish the skin to help keep it healthy. Haircut & Shave Moisturizing Cream does not have a harsh effect on skin unlike any other products."
