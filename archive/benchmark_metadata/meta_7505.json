        "This award winning novel is a searing look at what happened on May 4, 1970, on the campus of Kent State University as it became the final turning point in Americans' tolerance for the Vietnam War. National Guardsmen opened fire on unarmed student protesters, killing four and wounding nine. This visceral young adult novel reveals the modern relevance of the 1970 Kent State University shootings with stunning historical accuracy. Gold Medal winner in the 2017 Moonbeam Children's Book Awards, Young Adult Historical Fiction and a Mom's Choice Gold award designee.Throughout the harsh winter of 1969-1970, Kent, Ohio, became a microcosm of the growing unrest that threatened the very nature of democracy. Told from the viewpoint of seventeen-year-old Rachel Morelli, Leaving Kent State explores themes of the day that are strikingly similar to our own: terrorism, war, racial injustice, and gender inequality. As Rachel struggles to convince her dad that she should go to Pratt Institute in New York to pursue her dream of becoming an artist, Kent slips ever further off of its axis, in step with the growing discord across the nation. Caught between her love for her next door neighbor, Evan, a boy who has just returned from Vietnam, and her desire to escape Kent, Rachel must navigate one of the deadliest protests in U.S. History.\"While our nation has largely forgotten what happened on May 4, 1970,\" says the author, \"it was a defining moment for the way in which Americans consider involvement in war. While popular sentiment initially blamed the students for the massacre, it became clear in the years immediately following that something had gone terribly wrong in our democracy for American troops to have opened fire on unarmed college students. In our own protest laden present, the shootings at Kent State remain a valuable lesson in the escalation of force during peaceful citizen protests.\""

        "Review",
        "\"It feels as if you are transported to the Vietnam War era while reading. The author did a great job of making the novel historically accurate, but it wasn't overbearing. The historical elements were intertwined with a love story, one so classic and swoon-worthy that you can't help but become invested.\"Litpick 5 Star student review\"The Vietnam War comes home as risingpolitical tensions culminate in the 1970 Kent State University shootings inthis debut historical novel.Seventeen-year-old Rachel Morelli isthrilled when her neighbor and longtime crush, Evan Olesson, returns to Kent,Ohio, from his service in Vietnam. She's surprised to find that he's lostnearly all the fingers on his left hand and that his dreams of studying musichave disappeared. In a classic will-they-or-won't-they love story, Rachel pinesfor Evan, but he seems to view her as a little sister. Fedel balances thisromance with an exploration of Rachel's artistic ambitions and her dream ofattending Pratt Institute in New York City rather than local Kent StateUniversity. Behind the characters' ambitions, the novel pulses with culturaldetails of 1969 and '70: Rachel consumes Nestle Quik and watches WalterCronkite on the news, and she struggles with what it means that women can wearjeans and that her older sister can be accepted into law school. The changingsocial mores create a colorful backdrop as Rachel and her peers begin toquestion everything they know. It all comes to a head with Evan's return toKent, as characters grapple with the Vietnam War. Fedel shows the steps ofradicalization and--through Evan's experience--how ordinary people can commitacts of violence. As the story moves ever closer to the infamous Kent Statetragedy, during which Ohio National Guardsmen killed four students, thehistorical and political tensions grow. But the history remains grounded andnever expository as Rachel tries to figure out how she feels about events asthey happen. The strongest aspect of the book is how its characters use art asa form of resistance--Evan as a musician and Rachel as a visual artist; at onepoint, Evan explains that art is \"fighting back in your own way, and whenpeople see your art and they realize its truth, that's a protest.\"  A love story that engagingly mergesthemes of art and anger\" -Kirkus Review",
