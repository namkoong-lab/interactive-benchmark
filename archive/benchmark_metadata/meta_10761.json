    "description": [
        "Patient One Iron Chelate supplies 28mg of iron, an important component of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tissues throughout the body. Iron is also a part of myoglobin, a protein that helps muscle cells store oxygen, and ferritin, the body's main iron storage protein found in the intestines, liver and spleen. Iron bound to ferritin is readily available to meet the body's demands. Conventional iron supplementation, including forms such as ferrous sulfate, can cause GI side effects – including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and dark-colored stools – because these conventional forms are poorly absorbed. Our formula provides Ferrochel brand iron bis-glycinate, which was developed using unique patented chemistry, allowing it to be absorbed rapidly from the lumen of the intestines into mucosal cells and then released for transport throughout the body. The intestinal mucosal tissue tightly controls the release of Ferrochel, supporting the safety profile of this iron amino acid chelate."
