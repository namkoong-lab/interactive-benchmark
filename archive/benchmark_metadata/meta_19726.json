        "Review",
        "I have been doing appliqué by hand for at least ten years now and never taken any classes. Very early on the books about Baltimore Album quilts caught my eye, especially the books by Elly Sienkiewicz. Despite the fact that I'm no longer a beginner, the dvd had a few points that I hadn't figured out from her books. Remember this dvd is mostly for the beginner, but I think there's a tip here and there that might learn you a new trick or two. There are some patterns on the dvd as well. Now I don't have to use the copier for those patterns. If you are looking for more advanced appliqué techniques I think you should go for her second dvd that will be out in October this year. I'm ordering that dvd as well to fill my appliqué library. Well worth the $$ spent. --Wenche's Pieces of Time - August 5, 2009I think DVDs are going to be the classrooms for many as the expense of travel, accommodation and all make a personal class beyond many peoples budget. The beauty of the DVD is that if you miss something, just replay. It is all there for you to absorb whenever you are able. The first one is wonderful and I am so looking forward to the next... --Zoe Albert - August 25, 2009"
