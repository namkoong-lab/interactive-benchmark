        "The history of Brown County has been shaped largely by the Ohio River. It has allowed farmers and industries to transport their products and provided recreation, entertainment, and travel opportunities to the residents of the community. Even though flooding of the river brought destruction many times, it also enabled freedom for thousands of slaves. Under abolitionist leaders like John Rankin and John Parker, parts of Brown County became known as the \"Grand Central Station\" of the Underground Railroad. Interesting and notable Brown County natives include Ulysses S. Grant, who grew up to command one of the largest armies ever assembled and later became president of the United States; Col. Charles Young, the third African American to graduate from West Point and a military attache to Liberia; Rosie Riles, better known as \"Aunt Jemima\"; and Joe Smith, who inadvertently helped Louis Armstrong's career, also hailed from this great county."
