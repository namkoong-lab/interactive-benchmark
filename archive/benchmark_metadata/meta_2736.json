        "Grade 2-4 Harry is one of those characters who is made up of parts of children whom readers all know. He is the devilish second grader who plays pranks and gets into mischief but can still end up a good friend. In a series of brief scenes, children meet Harry as he shows a garter snake to Song Lee and later ends up being a snake himself for Halloween. His trick to make scary people out of pencil stubs backfires when no one is scared, and his budding romance with Song Lee goes nowhere on the trip to the aquarium. Told by his best friend, Doug, this story should prove to be popular with those just starting chapter books or looking for a new male character, along with Kline's ``Herbie Jones'' (Putnam).

        "Horrible Harry is narrator Doug's best friend. This funny, easy-reader story is about friends; school adventures; and a creative, nonconformist boy named Harry. Johnny Heller is the best narrator of children's books around; his youthful voice exuberantly tells the tale just like a child would--with pauses followed by rushes of enthusiastic, run-together, slightly exaggerated sentences. Heller's finesse at distinguishing the myriad of characters further enhances his narration. Horrible Harry is a pleasure, especially for early readers. When a superior narrator for children (Heller) connects with an exceptional storyteller (Kline), the result equals pure, laugh-aloud entertainment. J.A.B.
