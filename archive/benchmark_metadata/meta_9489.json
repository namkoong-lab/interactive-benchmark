Brilliantly analyzing and evoking Springsteen’s output, Marc Dolan unveils the pulsing heart of his music: its deep personal, political, and cultural resonances, which enabled Springsteen to reflect on his experiences as well as the world around him.

        "A riveting profile of New Jersey s great bard. Dolan, the ultimate Springsteen fan, has an encyclopedic knowledge of his subject. And his infectious love of American popular music is nothing short of awesome. The best book on Bruce ever written! --Douglas Brinkley, author of Cronkite\"A unique biography of a great rock n roll artist drawn from 40 years of thrilling performances. If you re a Springsteen fan, this will deepen your appreciation. And if you re not a fan, what the hell is wrong with you? --William McKeen, author of Rock 'n Roll is Here to Stay: An Anthology\"Bruce Springsteen and the Promise of Rock n Roll endeavors to get to the heart of its subject by viewing him through the economic, social, political, religious and family turmoil that formed a musician who found out early on how to make his guitar talk but spent painful decades refining what he needed to make it say. Springsteen s creative evolution and endurance as a populist American rock n roll hero is, according to Dolan, \"a slantwise way of telling the history of our times, how we have come together and divided over the last half-century, how we have changed what we think of ourselves as a people.\" --Robin Finn\"Dolan makes a point of telling more than just the Boss personal history, putting his putting his musical contributions in context with the country s political state. \"In an appreciative study that at times verges on the academic, Dolan traces Springsteen s journey through a song-by-song and album-by-album development \"Marc Dolan has written a book of rock criticism at its finest. He brings to the story of Bruce Springsteen an encyclopedic knowledge, a clean, fast-moving prose style, and an irrepressible love of his subject. The Boss deserves no less, and he could ask for no better. --John Matteson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Lives of Margaret Fuller\"Readable and engrossing. \"The definitive Springsteen biography/musical analysis, finely written and meticulously researched... by an academic who can write for a popular audience.... For fans, Dolan s book is a necessary addition to the Springsteen library. For more casual listeners, who often wonder just what the fuss is all about, this volume is a good place to start. --Michael Riley\"Those who are interested in the shaping of an American icon and, more significantly, the creation of some lasting American music may be directed safely to this book. --Tim Page\"With the notable exception of Bob Dylan, no other singer-songwriter still active in the 21st Century has spawned as many academic studies as The Boss, and Dolan s book is among the very best. As a chronicler of our times, Springsteen has few equals... and the author s examination of an extraordinary body of work is as clear-headed and accessible as the music itself.... By necessity, his book also serves as a history of America, outlining a nation s political conflicts, class disparity, prejudices and shortcomings.... [T]he author is especially evocative in his descriptions of working class New Jersey in the 60s and early 70s. Where he scores his most emphatic bullseyes, however, is in his assessment of how Springsteen handled his wealth and stardom; of how his conscience and politics adapted to being one of the most famous men in the world without losing sight of the struggles of his core audience, the little man on the street. --Terry Staunton, record Collector\"A unique biography of a great rock 'n roll artist drawn from 40 years of thrilling performances. If you're a Springsteen fan, this will deepen your appreciation. And if you're not a fan, what the hell is wrong with you? --William McKeen, author of \"Rock 'n Roll is Here to Stay: An Anthology\"[Dolan's] approach is at once academic and unapologetically enthusiastic. Classic songs and albums are deconstructed at length, along with their back stories and reception. Springsteen's personal evolution is measured in similar depth, from his tense relationship with his working-class father to the political consciousness reflected in his work, and how it's been variously interpreted (and misconstrued).... Devotees will delight in Dolan's account of the superstar's salad days playing Jersey clubs. (3 out of 4 stars) --Elysa GardnerA riveting profile of New Jersey's great bard.

An intelligent fan book written by a sophisticated admirer. --Darryl Lorenzo",
