        "The latest installment of Rizzoli's best-selling series of monographs on one of America's most important architects, Richard Meier, Architect Volume 4 documents Meier's work since the publication of the previous volume in 1999. This extensively illustrated presentation vividly conveys the purity and power of Meier's unique and celebrated vision. Twenty-seven residential, commercial, and civic projects are featured, including the 173/176 Perry Street residential towers in New York overlooking the Hudson River, perhaps the most celebrated new apartment buildings of our time; the Yale University History of Art and Arts Library in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Vatican-sponsored competition for his winning Jubilee Church of the year 2000 for the Vicariate of Rome. The development and significance of Richard Meier's work is discussed in two essays by the distinguished architectural historians and critics Kenneth Frampton and Joseph Rykwert. A biographical chronology and a selected bibliography complete this elegant and comprehensive monograph on a modern American master.
