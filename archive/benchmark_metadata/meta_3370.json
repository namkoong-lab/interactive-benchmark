        "Peri-peri is another name for chilies, a kind generally used in South Africa and parts of India. The first Europeans to set foot in South Africa were Portuguese explorers, and they introduced peri-peri to the cuisine of South Africa. Peri-peri (or sometimes piri-piri) is a blend of chilies, much like cayenne pepper. Our South African Peri-Peri blend is rich and dark with the heat of medium-hot chilies combined with hints of cumin and ginger. Add a pinch to home-fried potatoes with onions or use it to perk up scrambled eggs. It's also a great ready-made rub for pork or shrimp before grilling. Comes in our signature airtight tin, which measures 2-1/2 inches in diameter and 1-3/4 inches in height."
