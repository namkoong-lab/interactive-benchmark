Candace wrote her first novel while in law school. The experience taught her two things: 1. She can write even surrounded by towers of textbooks tall enough to crush her to death if there were an earthquake. 2. The only kind of tort she has any interest in is the kind that comes after the word chocolate and has an E on the end. So after Candace sold her first book, she happily gave up lawyer-ing to pursue her lifelong dream of writing. She lives in Austin, Texas with her husband, Pete Hopcus. Her daughter is author Anastasia Hopcus.', \"Copy and paste the following into your browser: http://bit.ly/CCampNewsletter to join Candace's newsletter for exclusive content and to win great prizes EVERY MONTH like FREE books and gift-cards to Amazon!\", 'Website: http://bit.ly/CCampWebsite', 'Amazon: http://bit.ly/CCampAmazon', 'BookBub: http://bit.ly/CCampBookBub', 'Goodreads: http://bit.ly/CCampGoodreads', 'Instagram: http://bit.ly/CCampInsta', 'Facebook: http://bit.ly/CCampFB', 'Twitter: http://bit.ly/CCampTwitter', 'Pinterest: http://bit.ly/CCampPinterest']}"
