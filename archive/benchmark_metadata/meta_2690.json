        "I really like this book. It is superbly written. I have a hard time finding Christian related fiction/mystery that is believable. This book flows with realistic scenarios, characters and plot lines --Joanne KocourekJust finished the book and I thought it was really good...very interesting and it flowed very well. I loved all the characters (well, except Melissa!) and felt invested in their lives. --Karoline Barrett",
