        "What if one of the Founding Fathers of the United States were suddenly transported to the 21st century? As it turns out, Ben Franklin is the perfect candidate for the job. As scientist, inventor, writer, publisher, and diplomat, he is well equipped to report on his experiences as an unexpected, unwitting time traveler.In this entertaining and whimsical new twist on historical fiction, Ben takes his readers on an unusual journey, investigating the people, places, and events of our amazing world of the future, as he calls it.Along the way, he shares his observations on a wide variety of contemporary subjects, from newsmakers to firefighters, summer travel tips to science fiction. He comments on media personalities, politics, computers, the Olympics, global warming, the latest inventions and discoveries, popular music, American holidays, parades, weird news, and much more.And, just as you would expect from Ben Franklin, he also weaves biographical details from his own real life story into the blog narrative - almost as if Ben picks up where history left off, bridging the gap between the 1700s and today."
