        "Sara liked to drink. Sara was a writer, and drinking seemed to be an element of the identity. As a writer, she searched for the story that would define who she was, and her drinking was a part of her. She drank socially at first, with friends or family, at parties, or festivals. She drank at home sometimes, a glass of wine or two. It was when the two glasses of wine turned into two bottles of wine, when her blacked-out drunken behavior began destroying her marriage, when she began combining her drinking with pills - prescribed or otherwise - this is when Sara began to realize she had a problem. It wasn't until she hit her last rock bottom that she understood her story. If she were to continue drinking, her marriage would be over. She knew she had to quit. So she did. Sara quickly learned that sobriety wasn't easy. She had never realized before what a focal point alcohol had been in her life. This new world she was in felt strange and unnatural. Sometimes the daily battle felt impossible. But inside the struggle she found words. One day, she threw on her husband's oversized Nike sweatshirt, drove her daughter to school, and came home to write. The words just poured out of her. Now she had a story. Despite the struggles she faced and still faces, Sara has remained sober. This is her story."

        "Sara Berelsman has a BA in English from Eastern Michigan University, and an MA in literature from there as well. She has taught college level courses in the humanities at several schools over the years. Her lifelong love of writing led her back to that, as she now writes regular columns for a couple of newspapers in her area. In addition to writing for the papers, Sara also writes the blog and newsletter for a mental health organization. Her short story, \"Answers in an Ice Storm,\" has been featured in a book which was released in June 2012,Spectral Hauntings: Anthology of the Supernatural. A few of her other short stories have won or placed in various writing contests. Besides writing, Sara enjoys playing with her two young daughters and two rescue dogs, and spending time with her husband. She also enjoys hula hooping, bike riding, listening to P!nk, watching thunderstorms, and being sarcastic. In her free time, Sara has been tossing around the idea of going back to school to be a counselor."
