Hannah Mills, local photographer, is struggling for work and to pay her rent. Great-Aunt Dorothy comes to the rescue from beyond the grave after she leaves Hannah a First Phase Indian Chief Navajo blanket, a very rare item worth at least a million dollars. That kind of money would set Hannah up for life. But, before she can take it to auction, her niece is kidnapped and a ransom demanded - the blanket. Hannah has to go to France to get her niece back, but she has no money to get there until she robs a bank. Arrested for the crime as she makes the drop in Paris, Hannah isn't going quietly and she drags FBI agent Finn MacNally along with her for the ride. Can they find Mandy before it's too late? Can they really win a fight against the biggest Russian human and drug trafficking ring or will their luck run out at the last minute?\", 'Point and Shoot for Your Life by Robin Murphy is a funny book. A mixture of humor, murder, mystery, suspense and romance, it has all the ingredients of a rollicking good read and it delivered all it promised. I found myself laughing, cringing, and holding my breath at different points during the story as I hung on for the ride. This is a book with no let-up; it starts on a high and just keeps on going, action all the way. The plot was very clever, brilliantly written, and the characters really fitted the bill. This is a story that will leave you breathless and, by the time the end arrives, worn out and ready to let go. Really great story, well-written and good fun to read. Would love to see more of this.', 'Sullivan\\'s Secret - Midwest Book Review - Communing with the spirits may leave you with some very unwanted responsibility. \"Sullivan\\'s Secret\" follows Marie Bartek as she rediscovers her talents to communicate with spirits. Working with friends in a paranormal society, she finds that her skill leaves her with the responsibility to stop murders from sweeping her town and she has to put out her own neck to stop the hysteria. \"Sullivan\\'s Secret\" is a fascinating read that will be hard to put down.', 'Secret of the Big Easy - Reader\\'s Favorite - \"...has plenty going that grabs the reader\\'s attention and keeps it until the final page. The suspense surrounding the murders that Marie is seeing in her visions is really first rate> Add to that the mystery of why the murders are taking place and you have a first rate story, but that is just the tip of the iceberg with this story, because there is so much more going on. There is the romance going on between Marie and her boyfriend Cory, who just happens to be the police chief of Sullivan\\'s Island. My favorite parts of the story are the paranormal supernatural elements of the story. Marie is trying to learn how to handle seeing spirits, and to deal with the visions she sees. The visions she had were very vivid allowing me to feel as if I could actually see what was happening, and also kept me wondering what might happen next. I am a huge fan of ghost hunting/paranormal activity and because of Ms. Murphy\\'s accurate descriptions it was easy to see that she had really done her research in this area. The secondary characters really balance out the story, and the relationship between Gale and Tim was often funny. I always enjoy when there is an animal written into a story and in this one we have Bailey, a chocolate Lab which Cory gave to Marie...\"', \"Federal City's Secret - Reader's Favorite - In the pages of this book the reader will find a really fun and interesting tale about a magazine reporter who is over her head in a political investigation. Kelly Kaufman is a reporter, assigned to dig into a political figure who wants to run for president. When she doesn't contact her mother for two weeks, Shawna calls the paranormal investigators. She has some shadows and such in her apartment and uses this to bring them to D.C. Now Marie Bartek is the head of the paranormal group that consists of a few very interesting characters, including her heartthrob, Cory. They take the job. After the group takes care of the ghost at Shawna's, she accepts the request to stay and work on the disappearance of Kelly. All goes well until she realizes that she brought more than just her group to D.C.--it seems that Demon B also accompanied her. Choosing to stay and find Kelly may cost them several lives: that of her mentor, Kelly's and hers.\", 'It is a very good paranormal story, in the same realm as \"Ghost Busters\". I really enjoyed the telling and the tale. I consider it a must have in the library of lovers of suspense, romance, and paranormal investigation. \"Federal City\\'s Secret\" is well-done entertainment for a hot day at the beach or a lazy afternoon at the swimming pool. Robin presents a great story and characters. This is great reading for young adults to adults alike. You will really love this paranormal detective story that will keep you glued through to the last page. I loved it and believe that you will too.', \"Secret of Coffin Island: Reader's Favorite -\", \"Secret of Coffin Island is Book 4 in Robin Murphy's paranormal mystery series, Marie Bartek and the SIPS Team. Dr. Marie Bartek and her fiance, Police Chief Cory Miller, have finally tied the knot. Their wedding festivities are interrupted, however, by the discovery of a headless corpse. While criminal investigations are, strictly speaking, Cory's milieu, Marie and her team of psychic researchers have been instrumental in solving mysteries in the past, and she has already received visions that seem to pertain to the mystery at hand. Her mentor and friend, Myra, who had passed after suffering a heart attack, has continued her mentorship albeit from the other side, and Marie takes comfort from both her presence and her guidance. Marie's also been asked to help with the case of Isabella, a young woman whose mother is concerned that she's been possessed, but Marie quickly determines that Isabella is also a gifted psychic.\", \"Robin Murphy's paranormal mystery, Secret of Coffin Island: Marie Bartek and the SIPS Team, Book 4, is an exciting and well-plotted novel. While it's the fourth book in the series, Murphy includes just enough background information to allow this book to be read on its own without giving away too much about the previous mysteries. I found myself enchanted by Sullivan Island and the ambiance of a beach community, and enjoyed the plot's historical connection to Edgar Allan Poe's The Gold Bug. The author also gives a valid working picture of a psychic investigation team at work as well as having the husband/wife team working together on the case. Secret of Coffin Island is an interesting and quite effective blend of the paranormal and the police procedural genres that works marvelously. Her main character's idea for a retreat for psychic youth is inspired and gives the series a sense of continuance, and Isabella's pivotal role in this story makes it fresh and compelling. Secret of Coffin Island: Marie Bartek and the SIPS Team, Book 4 is highly recommended.\"]}"
