        "Need sea-faring, pirate, or port adventure ideas for a one-shot or to build a campaign? Use our Sidequest Decks: High Seas, Pirates, & Ports. Each card is a dynamic adventure! Whether your campaign is classic fantasy or set in the swashbuckling era, these adventure outlines are easy to adapt to your setting. How to use them: Draw a card for an adventure outline. It includes backstory, ways to get the PCs involved, encounter possibilities, and follow-up ideas. The other side is the most important map for that adventure. Use maps from other cards as needed. Sidequest Decks are perfect for stocking a hex crawl or developing a side trek on the fly. You may even chain several together for an entire campaign!"
