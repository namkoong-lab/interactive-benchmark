        "Product Description",
        "Everything Is Never Quite Enough is more than a simple retrospective of one of world music's most influential artists. It is an historical overview, a glimpse into the world of an artist who has little time for musical boundaries. While cultivating one of the most unique global fusions in music today, Wasis over the course of the 19 tracks on Everything combines elements of Arabic, Calypso, R & B, Reggae, Latin and pop all while retaining its traditional Senegalese and West African base. Lyrics are sung in French, English and Diop's' native Wolof often weaving in and out of the languages and all in enthralling service to the elegance and seduction of Wasis' voice.",
        "The first track, \"Le passeur\" - a brand new song that appears here for the first time - is the latest example of Wasis' artistic alchemy. The other 18 tracks are culled from his three 90's releases (the never released in North America soundtrack Hyènes and the no longer available No Sant and award-winning Toxu) and represent the very best of Wasis Diop. Included are the title track (used in a provocative scene in the film The Thomas Crown Affair); \"DèFaal Lu wor\" (a stirring version of Talking Heads \"Once In A Lifetime\"); the mesmerizing North African rhythms of \"Dune\"; the Afro-urban pulse of \"Soweto Daal\"; the radio- ready \"African Dream\"; the tenderly evocative \"No Sant\"; the romantic \"Julia\", every track in its own way an offering from Wasis Diop vision of music of the world as open and free.",

        ", and his soundtrack to the movie",
        "Hyenes",
        ". Not an artist for the African music purist, Diop creates a modern multi-layered sound that skillfully weaves in elements of jazz, rock, and soul as well as indigenous music from other countries. It's the polar opposite of a field recording, but the fusion is nonetheless a skillful one. One does wonder why Diop's first album is five years is a collection of old material, but this is a fine and readily available stopgap as we wait. --",
