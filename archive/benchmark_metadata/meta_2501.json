        "Jane Austen’s popularity never seems to fade. She has hordes of devoted fans, and there have been numerous adaptations of her life and work. But who was Jane Austen? The writer herself has long remained a mystery. And despite the resonance her work continues to have for teens, there has never been a young adult trade biography on Austen. Catherine Reef changes that with this highly readable account. She takes an intimate peek at Austen’s life and innermost feelings, interweaving her narrative with well-crafted digests of each of Austen’s published novels. The end result is a book that is almost as much fun to read as Jane’s own work—and truly a life revealed.",

        "Emma",
        ", or one of Austen’s other great novels, we come face-to-face with her memorable characters. We meet sparkling Elizabeth Bennet, proud Fitzwilliam Darcy, capable Anne Elliot, reckless Mr. Willoughby, and sensitive Marianne Dashwood. We laugh, cry, or even cringe as they make mistakes and learn tough lessons. We rejoice when they find happiness at last. They were created long ago, but they are like people in every age.",
        "It is a joy to return to Austen’s novels throughout our lives, because like all great books, they continue to surprise and delight. But what about the woman behind the words? Our view of Jane Austen relies on a single watercolor portrait, a handful of letters, her family’s written accounts, and, of course, her six published novels. Yet from these sources a portrait emerges of a brilliant woman with a deep understanding of human nature. She loved a good laugh--often at others’ expense--and she was devoted to her large and active family.",
