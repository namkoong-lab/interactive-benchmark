    "description": [
        "The skin around the eyes is the thinnest and most delicate skin on the face and can appear sunken with age. This luxuriously rich eye cream is so advanced, it improves firmness and brightens while providing intense moisturization. It also minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with the combined power of a collagen-enhancing peptide duo that restores the supporting structure to revitalize cells for firmer skin. As the skin ages, it loses moisture and becomes dry and porous, weakening its natural barrier that guards against free-radical and environmental damage. TimeWise Firming Eye Cream works to better protect the skin around the delicate eye area while it counteracts this damage. The combined power of a collagen-enhancing peptide duo works to restore the supporting structure to revitalize cells for firmer-looking skin. Soothing botanical extracts and brightening agents are used to condition and prepare the skin for moisturization, resulting in a more even skin tone."
