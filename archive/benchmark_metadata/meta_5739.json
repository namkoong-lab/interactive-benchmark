        "Whatever the next item is on your to-do list -- whether it's arriving at the jobsite before dawn or getting your travel trailer set up in time to see the sunset -- CURT class 4 trailer hitches offer greater towing power to let you Bring It. These custom receiver hitches are built to tackle bigger jobs and bolder adventures, all while giving you a custom fit for your vehicle. Class 4 hitches are available for a variety of makes and models, from pickup trucks and SUVs to full-size and commercial vans. This particular class 4 hitch fits certain years of the Dodge Sprinter 2500 and 3500 (to verify vehicle compatibility, see application info). It provides a weight carrying capacity of 10,000 lbs. GTW and 1,000 lbs. TW. It can also accept a weight distributing hitch, offering a maximum WD capacity of 12,000 lbs. and a WDTW of 1,200 lbs. CURT class 4 tow hitches are as much suited for work as they are for play. With their high load capacities, they are typically used for towing larger trailers, including everything from a double-axle utility trailer or livestock trailer to a full-length camper or large boat trailer (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest weight capacity of any towing component). All CURT class 4 receiver hitches come with a 2\" receiver tube opening and all the necessary hardware for a complete installation. From light-duty to heavy-duty, every CURT custom hitch is engineered to be vehicle-specific, using actual vehicles to create the optimal design. We then combine high-strength steel, precise welding and a co-cured finish of liquid A-coat and durable black powder coat to provide you with a hitch you can depend on. To prove it, we test all our hitches in accordance with SAE J684 for safety."
