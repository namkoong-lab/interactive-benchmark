        "With this small group Bible study you or your Christian small group can select a topic of interest and conveniently do a mini-study on that topic in one session! Each topic has a collection of relevant Bible verses, 5-10 discussion questions, a daily prayer, and a homework assignment called \"Take Action!\" God doesn't want us to be biblical scholars - he expects us to take action and be disciples. This study will help you or your small group do just that!"

        "About the Author",
        "As a former atheist and agnostic, now a disciple of Christ, Brian Johns gives thanks to God for the small groups that filled his life and heart and welcomed him into the body of Christ. It all started when he and his wife were invited to join a small group of young couples who all had small children like the two of them did. Brian didn't know what to expect but assumed it would be dull Bible studies and non-stop feverish prayer sessions. It was not. The group bar-b-qued, went on hikes, laughed and played together, compared parenting strategies, discussed favorite sermons and Bible verses, and overall, got to be very close friends. It was through this fellowship that Brian began to see the depth and character of Christian love and eventually claimed Jesus as his personal Savior!",
