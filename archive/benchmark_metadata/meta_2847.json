        "Author's note:  Like everyone else in our country, I was shocked and devastated by the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Newtown, CT, on December 14, 2012.   Twenty beautiful children and six heroic teachers were lost that day.  I prayed for them, all of them.  I prayed hard, and I know my prayers were added to those from around the world. During my prayers, I received a vision, a feeling.  The children became lambs; their teachers were angels.  I saw the little lambs scooped up into God's great, loving hands and escorted by the angels to Heaven.  Despite the horrors of the tragedy, this vision gave me some comfort.  It was like God was saying, \"The kids are okay.  They are all okay.  They are with me.  They are mine and they are safe.\"  Then, this lovely little children's story tumbled into my heart and mind.  It was then that",
