        "Precisionist Technology",
        "With Precisionist, Bulova has added a third prong to a standard two prong quartz crystal creating a torsional resonator. This innovation results in eight times the vibration frequency of a traditional quartz watch resulting in the most accurate watch with a continuously sweeping second hand. The aesthetic movement of the second hand becomes the symbol to the consumer of Bulova Precisionist and signals a watch with accuracy so exceptional, you can see it. The technology is accurate to 10 seconds per year as compared to most other quartz watches, which are accurate to fifteen seconds per month.",
        "About Bulova",
        "In 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant from Bohemia, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since that time, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.",
        "A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s and ladies’ wristwatches (1919 and 1924). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With the same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).",
        "Today, this dedication to creativity continues, with Bulova the only brand to offer three distinct timekeeping technologies – quartz, mechanical and Precisionist. One of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova continues to maintain its position at the forefront of the timekeeping industry, upholding an extraordinary heritage of achievement in design, style and technology as it expands to meet the needs of a diverse global audience."
