        "Plone is a web content management system that features among the top two percent of open source projects and is used by more than 300 solution providers in 57 countries. Its powerful workflow system, outstanding security track record, friendly user interface, elegant development model, and vibrant community makes Plone a popular choice for building content-centric applications. By customizing and extending the base platform, integrators can build unique solutions tailored to specific projects quickly and easily. If you want to create your own web applications and advanced websites using Plone 4, Professional Plone 4 Development is the book you need. The first edition of this book remains one of the most widely read and recommended Plone books. This second edition is completely revised and up-to-date for Plone 4.1, covering new topics such as Dexterity, Diazo, jQuery, and z3c.form, as well as improved ways of working with existing technologies such as Buildout, SQLAlchemy, and the Pluggable Authentication Service. It retains the writing style and comprehensive approach that made the first edition so popular. Built around a realistic case study, Professional Plone 4 Development will take you from an understanding of Plone's central concepts, through basic customization, theming, and custom development, to deployment and optimization. What this book covers This book is divided into four sections: 1. First, we will introduce Plone and the case study, and learn how to set up a development environment. 2. The second section covers basic customization, including theming a Plone site using Diazo."
