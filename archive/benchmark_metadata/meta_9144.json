        "French philosopher Abbé de Condillac produced perhaps the most original contributions to eighteenth-century economics. His conclusions as to the desirability of removing barriers to free trade and of competitive market economies mirrored Smith’s, published three months later.",
        "Commerce and Government",
        "has been called “one of the most sustained defenses of economic liberty in the eighteenth century.” In Condillac’s own words, to eliminate the abuses and injustices of government it is necessary “to give trade full, complete, and permanent freedom.” Shelagh and Walter Eltis, editors of the volume, write, “English language readers who come upon",
        "Commerce and Government",
        "for the first time will find…that the case for competitive market economics has rarely been presented more powerfully and that there is continuing relevance in Condillac’s account of the difficulties that those who seek to liberalize economies still encounter.”",

        "Review",
        "This is a reprint of the translation published by Edward Elgar in 1997. Condillac's theory of economics was initially condemned by the physiocrats because in his utility-based analysis, industry and commerce and not just agriculture contributed to the wealth of France. This first English translation includes a comprehensive account of Condillac's life and contributions, the importance of which were widely recognized after the marginal revolution of the 1870's. Translator and editor Shelagh M. Eltis is a UK-based historian; Walter Eltis is emeritus, Exeter College, Oxford and visiting professor of economics at the U. of Reading, UK.",
