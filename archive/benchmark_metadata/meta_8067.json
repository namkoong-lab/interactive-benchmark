        "For as long as I can remember, I have loved imaginative stories. For me, beautiful stories are equally wonderful and necessary as birdsong and flowering trees in spring, and hot chocolate and freshly fallen snow in winter. When I sit down to write and open my heart for new stories,they come into my mind, joyfully and free, as birds fly, and I write them down for you. Now I invite you to study with Anna at the magical Quentin Academy, and experience with Anna how danger breaks into her beautiful world. Will Anna and her friends successfully defend the peace and freedom of their world against the evil mind controllers?Will the dragon help them? Or is it already too late?",
