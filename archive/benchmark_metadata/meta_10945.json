    "description": [
        "Linden linden is a beautiful green floral that grows on trees. So much for good things not growing on trees (just don't call mom and tell her). In Europe, many legends and superstitions are centered on these trees. Linden wood was used for carving sacred works of art. Among the Germanic peoples the linden was a \"sacred\" tree for people in love, the tree that brought fertility and prosperity. In the middle ages, people carved images of the virgin Mary and figures of the saints from linden wood, calling the wood lignum sacrum, sacred wood."
