        "Over the course of four years, we interviewed women entrepreneurs in diverse industries and at various stages of growth. They consistently told us about the inherent feminine strengths they relied upon for success, the support and help they most needed, and the advice they would give to others starting down their own entrepreneurial path. The SmartGirls Way book captures these insights in a practical guide for existing and aspiring entrepreneurs. It can help you understand and leverage your strengths and direct you towards the resources, skills and business processes you will need to see your Vision-Inspired Big Idea (ViBI™) come to life. Our belief is that the next economy will be built on the backs of entrepreneurs. Everywhere we turn women are hearing the call to play a meaningful role in the design and creation of a balanced and healthy future. The SmartGirls Way can set you on the path to building the business of your dreams AND contribute to a thriving future.",
