        "The wife of notorious William Henry Handy Plumer--the Bannack sheriff hanged by Vigilantes, Electa Bryan Plumer has much to offer readers. This incredibly detailed and fast-moving historical novel presents a portion of Electa's life just prior to meeting Plumer, her courtship with Plumer, and the short period of time she was Plumer's wife. This is a love story from a woman's perspective, set in the early 1860s Gold Rush West, and deeply entrenched in Idaho Territory (Montana) history and lore. The events of the Civil War and the \"settling\" of the frontier West are just two of the fascinating historical threads working their way through Electa's incredible personal saga of exploration, adventure, love, and loss."

        "Review",
        "\"This novel brings us to the heart of one of the most intriguing mysteries of the Western frontier--the guilt or innocence of an early lawman hanged by Montana vigilantes. This compelling story from America's past is beautifully written. The author's meticulous research has unearthed colorful details which re-create daily life during the gold-rush era. A delightful, rewarding read!\"--Western historian R. E. Mather\"By providing her schoolteacher protagonist with a portable writing desk, the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the novels of George Eliot, and the notion that 'the observations of a woman' traveling west along the Missouri should be'no less interesting than those of Clark and Lewis,' novelist Diane Elliott has made Electa Bryan a credible narrator whose decision 'to record the whole of it' affords readers a new perspective on one of the most famous--or infamous--incidents in Montana history. Rich in the details of everyday living--riverboat travel in the midst of the Civil War, women's work on the Sun River government farm, married life in Bannock's Yankee Flats--and sprinkled with the comings and goings of such familiar figures as Granville Stuart, Johnny Grant, and Sidney Edgerton,",

        "As the Civil War rages on, the gold fields and open valleys of the frontier Rocky Mountains fill with treasure seekers, fugitives, and missionaries. Twenty-year-old schoolteacher and adventurer Electa Bryan finds her way to the Sun River Government Farm to \"civilize\" the Blackfeet and help her married sister with family life. She also finds herself becoming entangled with the notorious Bannack, Montana, sheriff William Henry Handy Plumer, whose true character and how he meets his fate are but two of the mysteries unraveled in this beautifully imagined, meticulously researched historical novel.Based on real-life Montana characters, Strength of Stone is a love story told through journal entries and letters that bring vividly to life Electa's experience of adventure, love, and loss.",
