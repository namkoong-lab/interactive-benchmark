        ". As aficionados of classic science fiction, Swedroe and Berkin saw similarities between the monumental struggle of Scott Carey, novelist Richard Matheson's Incredible Shrinking Man, and that of every individual investor trying to beat the market. Swedroe and Berkin explain in academic yet simple terms what is happening to the alpha for which so many investors yearn.Offering compelling data from decades of academic research, Swedroe and Berkin present the hard truth as they know it — it's not worth the time or effort spent battling to win those few extra cake crumbs. Instead, focus on the things you can control and discover what life has to offer beyond the quest for alpha."

        "\"Swedroe and Berkin provide a concise treatment of the research passive and active investors (both individual and institutional and also financial advisors) need to become more successful. This treatment also appeals to college finance students seeking to gain a better understanding of passive versus active investing, along with 'the correct answers.' The authors enable investors seeking to 'generate real alpha' to understand that passive investing is increasingly the correct approach, while active investing is just the opposite.\" — John Haslem, Professor Emeritus of Finance, University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business and Editor/Author of",

        "\"Ever wonder why your actively managed funds almost invariably disappoint you? Piece by piece, the authors peel back the claims that active managers can add value in a system where it gets harder and harder to generate Alpha. In a world where academic research uncovers the true sources of return and markets relentlessly become more efficient, what's an investor to do? Go passive! Swedroe is the master of explaining financial research in terms that every reader can easily understand. Read and improve your financial acumen.\" — Francis Armstrong III, Author of",

        "Experts panel. Yet, I do not own a single individual stock or corporate bond. Rather, I invest in low-cost passive mutual funds and ETFs. Swedroe and Berkin demonstrate how this strategy can be used to achieve a prudent, globally diversified portfolio. Their book could well end up saving you a lot of money — your money — and giving you a lot of free time.\" — William Reichenstein, Investment Professor at Baylor University\"In this short but powerful book, Swedroe and Berkin have advanced the debate on active v. passive to a new level. Their discussion of how alpha (beating the market) has steadily morphed into beta (achieving market returns) is the best description I've read of this process yet. No polemics here, just a data centered exposition of the issues — the longtime trademark of Larry Swedroe.\"— Edward Wolfe, Professor Emeritus of Finance, Western Kentucky University\"Swedroe and Berkin roll up their sleeves and dig into decades of research to help us better understand how markets work. The result is a clear and concise synthesis of how investing can indeed be a 'winner's game.' Read, study and apply their approach.\"— Tobias Moskowitz, Fama Family Professor of Finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Managing Director, AQR Capital Management",

        "\"If you think you can beat the market, you need to read this wise book. Swedroe and Berkin show that whatever superior investment performance you may achieve is fully accounted for by the risks you are taking with your money and even risk compensation may be shrinking as well. But there are things you can do, and the authors suggest a number of sensible strategies to improve investment results.\"— Burton Malkiel, Author of",
