        ", Venkat S. Devraj has compiled an unprecedented collection of guidelines and suggestions as a \"working Oracle professional's book on high availability.\"",
        "Although it is the author's aim to avoid detailed theory and focus on practical solutions to the problem, the early portions of the book contain some high-level topics such as defining your organization's exact uptime requirements and precisely characterizing what constitutes an emergency for your installation. These areas are often quickly glossed over in other guides, but the presentation here is precise and quite useful in striving for the holy grail of 24-hour uptime.",
