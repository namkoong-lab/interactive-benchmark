        "Too much exercise can kill you.",
        "The Haywire Heart",
        "is the first book to examine heart conditions in athletes.",
        "Intended for anyone who competes in endurance sports like cycling, triathlon, running races of all distances, and cross-country skiing,",
        "The Haywire Heart",
        "presents the evidence that going too hard or too long can damage your heart forever. You’ll find what to watch out for, what to do about it, and how to protect your heart so you can enjoy the sports you love for years to come.",
        "The Haywire Heart",
        "shares the developing research into a group of conditions known as “athlete’s heart”, starting with a wide-ranging look at the warning signs, symptoms, and how to recognize your potential risk. Leading cardiac electrophysiologist and masters athlete Dr. John Mandrola explores the prevention and treatment of heart conditions in athletes like arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation and flutter, tachycardia, hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease. He reviews new research about exercise intensity and duration, recovery, inflammation and calcification, and the ways athletes inflict lasting harm.",
        "These heart problems are appearing with alarming frequency among masters athletes who are pushing their bodies harder than ever in the hope that exercise will keep them healthy and strong into their senior years. The book is complete with gripping case studies of elite and age-group athletes from journalist Chris Case―like the scary condition that nearly killed cyclist and coauthor Lennard Zinn―and includes a frank discussion of exercise addiction and the mental habits that prevent athletes from seeking medical help when they need it.",
        "Dr. Mandrola explains why many doctors misdiagnose heart conditions in athletes and offers an invaluable guide on how to talk with your doctor about your condition and its proven treatments. He covers known heart irritants, training and rest modifications, effective medicines, and safe supplements that can reduce the likelihood of heart damage from exercise.",
        "Heart conditions affect hardcore athletes as well as those who take up sports seeking better health and weight loss.",
        "The Haywire Heart",
        "is a groundbreaking and critically important guide to heart care for athletes.",
        "By protecting your heart now and watching for the warning signs, you can avoid crippling heart conditions and continue to exercise and compete for years to come."

        "Heart conditions strike athletes, too.",
        "Despite their lean looks and healthy glow, athletes entering their 50s and 60s are seeing a dramatic rise in abnormal heart rhythms, known as arrhythmias. These older athletes are pushing their bodies harder than ever in the hope that exercise will keep them healthy and strong into their senior years.",

        "If you’re an athlete, you already know that regular exercise is the best medicine for your general health. You’ve probably read the research suggesting that just 30 minutes a day is the ideal dose for improving your cardiovascular health. You’ve heard that those 30 minutes can reduce your risk of cancer and extend your life expectancy. And you may have laughed out loud.",
        "Thirty minutes? That’s just a warm-up. What about those who live to push beyond? If a half hour is good, then surely more miles, day after day, year after year, must make you even fitter, even healthier, even happier. Right?",
        "Think again.",

        "The Haywire Heart",
        "is the first book to examine the latest findings and reveal a paradoxical truth: Many endurance athletes are damaging their hearts by repeatedly pushing to extremes.",
        "Tragically, training hard for top performance can cause abnormal heart rhythms. These arrhythmias are not just frightening. They can be deadly. And they’re being diagnosed in increasing numbers of athletes, particularly in those who continue to strive for more as they enter middle age.",
        "The Haywire Heart",
        "explains in detail how and why endurance exercise could cause a variety of heart arrhythmias. It presents the medical evidence and lays out your chances of developing a heart condition from the sport you love. And it tells you what you can do to prevent more damage and stay active.",
