        "Patterson, a straight-laced insurance adjuster who recently discovered both surfing and God, convinces his wife to homeschool their rambunctious twins. David is a liberal stay-at-home dad who feels stuck in suburbia and throws his energy into homeschoolong his three “ducklings.” Wedding photographer Keith has just separated from Beth, a full-time mom struggling to manage her own private chaos. And there’s Jennifer, Keith and Beth’s precocious daughter, who copes with severe allergies and doesn’t understand why she’s not attending school and seeing friends like she used to. Will homeschooling provide balance and harmony for these families? Or will it bring unforeseen challenges and stress?   In this “witty and insightful” debut novel, Suzanne Greenberg takes a serious look at the choices parents profess to make on behalf of their children, as well as the unpredictable ways in which new relationships can change our lives (",

        "Three unique families decide to embark on the journey of homeschooling, each for very different reasons. David is a stay-at-home dad, who wants to protect his daughters while giving them a feeling of intellectual independence. Beth, while going through a divorce, fears for her daughter’s safety at school due to extreme food allergies. Patterson is a working father, who asks his wife to homeschool their boys so they can enjoy childhood a little longer. They all have good intentions, but as they embark on their journey, and their lives intertwine in unexpected ways, it becomes increasingly clear that it’s the parents, not the children, who have the most to learn. Told from alternating viewpoints, Greenberg’s first novel is a witty and humorous character study that passes judgment on the homeschooling population. The resulting polemic reveals a reactionary opinion and narrow understanding of this growing movement in the U.S. While potentially offensive to homeschoolers, this pontifical narrative may appeal to some of them as well as to fans of biting satires. --Cortney Ophoff",
