        "Of course you know who Warren Buffett is; he's the most successful investor in the world―maybe of all times. But what do you know about his approach to business and investing? It's an approach that, over the past four decades, has made him richest man in America and the third-richest man in the world, and that has earned vast fortunes for his business partners and investors. But as Buffett himself will tell you, at the heart of any wealth-building system there are certain core beliefs, not just about finance, but about business, work, morality, your responsibility to yourself, your family and society, and about living a decent life. Written in conjunction with the hit television series, \"Secret Millionaire Club\" and with Buffett's input and full support, this book makes Buffett's financial philosophy and homespun life lessons available to everyone outside his \"Secret Club.\"",

        "From the Inside Flap",
        "The Secret Millionaires Club began with a bunch of local kids who wanted to use their spare money to help the community. They soon began to learn about business, and found that they could help others around the world with their own growing businesses, as well. Along the way, they learned a lot of good lessons not just about business, but about growing as successful people. When the kids came to me to ask for advice, I gave them ideas which I had learned myself over the years and seen had helped others to be successful as well. Sometimes I asked friends of mine to come and be a part of the stories. They were always smart people with their own valuable lessons to teach . . . Jay-Z and Shaquille O'Neal and Kelly Rowland and Nick Cannon . . . even Bill Gates came along on one of our adventures.",
        "Almost always, the members learned very simple principles and concepts. We have found that these simple principles not only helped them and their businesses to be successful, but helped them to grow and mature as people and citizens of the community. They include lessons on borrowing and loaning money. On choosing partners and good managers. On the importance of always trying new ideas, and saving money, of course. All the lessons in the book are seen in the TV series, the Secret Millionaires Club, and we are proud to share them with you now.",
