        "CATCH A FALLEN STAR is the story of Layton Cross, a man who fails upward. As his career sinks as his battles with two ex-wives go public, his fame and popularity continue to rise. Can he get out from the tangle of family troubles, deceitful friends, devious journalists, and cunning studio heads? Grobel, whose in-depth interviews have appeared in Playboy, Movieline, Premiere, and Rolling Stone, is on familiar territory with this screenplay. BEGIN AGAIN FINNEGAN: How far would you go to help your best friend? That’s the question journalist Devin Hunter faces when movie star Adrian Kiel asks him to be his alibi to cover a possible murder. Hunter’s decision leads him into a labyrinth of secret lives, psychiatric wards, celebrity “justice,” blackmail, and betrayal. Dealing with relationships and their consequences, it explores the loyalty of a friendship and how one misguided decision sets off a chain of events that spiral out of control."
