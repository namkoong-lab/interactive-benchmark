What this book most reminds me of is being in a conversation with another fan of the Dead and this other fan of the Dead actually can remember the dates and places where some pretty intense stuff happened. It's a tale of a time gone by ... a happening that will never happen again ... a band that existed for the music, for the fans and for the good of the universe.\".- Amazon customer and DeadheadJanuary 13, 2018",
