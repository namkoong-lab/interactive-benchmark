        "Emmy Award-winner Guy Pearce (Memento, Iron Man 3) reprises his iconic role as Jack Irish, a former criminal lawyer with a penchant for getting dragged into unsavory situations. In Season 2, Jack’s life has hit a rough patch: the horse-racing world is in turmoil; Jack’s beloved local pub may be sold; and his journalist girlfriend, Linda (Marta Dusseldorp, A Place to Call Home), has left him. Then the suspicious death of an international student at a dubious Australian college plunges Jack into a high-stakes investigation. To crack the case, Jack will need Linda’s help, along with assistance from a beautiful, enigmatic psychiatrist, Dr. Rory Finch (Danielle Cormack, Rake, Wentworth).Praised by critics and fans alike for its sharp humor, sly charm, and thrilling cinematic style, this “classic noir” (The Wall Street Journal) series also stars Aaron Pederson (Mystery Road), Roy Billing (Underbelly), and Kate Atkinson (Wentworth)."
