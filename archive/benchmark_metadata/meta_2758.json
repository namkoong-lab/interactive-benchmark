        "Erwin Lutzer offers hope and a challenge to Christians. It is not time to despair even as we face these difficult realities. Two thousand years of church history are behind us to show that the church does not need freedom or ease in order to be faithful. God’s calling on His people can be fulfilled no matter what.",
        "Dr. Lutzer calls Christians to be agents of change in these increasingly secular times, and he offers hope and direction. As the nation morphs, Christians are called to adjust, to be faithful ambassadors for Christ in a country where many are turning away from Him."
