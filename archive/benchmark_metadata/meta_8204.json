        "\"Canine Epilepsy\" is a comprehensive guide to nervous system function, seizure activity, medical, and alternative treatments. This book covers related healthcare concerns such as thyroid and liver disease. It also teaches owners ways to help their dogs before and after seizures. Perhaps most importantly, however, \"Canine Epilepsy\" examines seizure triggers, such as diet, vaccines, and chemical use and their very clear links to brain activity.",

Treatments: medications, diet, acupuncture, and more. Alternatives to flea and tick pesticides. Vaccines, boosters, and titres. Homemade diets vs. commercial diets. Liver, bladder, thyroid, and ophthalmic issues. How to interrupt a seizure. Seizure alerts. Caring for the dog after a seizure. Emotional support for owners.

        "From the Publisher",
        "With a unique combination of personal and professional experiences, Caroline Levin has created several important resource books for dog owners. Levins experience in healthcare began as a registered nurse. She specialized in such fields as ophthalmology, family practice nursing, and endocrinology. After a decade of nursing, Levin left this field to manage an ophthalmic veterinary clinic. It was here that she realized the desperate need blind-dog owners had for educational material. Since then, she has written the first two works on this topic: Living With Blind Dogs and Blind Dog Stories.",
        "Periodically, Levins readers contacted her with questions about canine diabetes and its related problems. She realized that there was a need for educational material on these topics, too. Levin scrutinized the current literature, drew on her own nursing background, and consulted with dozens of experts. What began as a small diabetes text, evolved into a dissertation on immune disorders, metabolic disease, endocrine problems, and canine nutrition. The result was her third book, Dogs, Diet and Disease, winner of the prestigious Maxwell Award for \"Best Healthcare Book 2001.\"",
        "At the conclusion of that project, Levin was approached by yet another reader who explained the need epileptic-dog owners had for educational material. Levins latest work, Canine Epilepsy, takes a comprehensive look at one of the most common neurological problems diagnosed in dogs today.",
