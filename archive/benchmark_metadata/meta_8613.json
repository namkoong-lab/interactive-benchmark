        "Kindergarten-Grade 7-Galileo and the Stargazers uses Jim Weiss's storytelling to highlight figures of mathematics and astronomy, including Archimedes, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton and Galileo. \"Archimedes and the Golden Crown\" presents a biography of this Greek inventor/mathematician with a fairy-tale venue suited to ages five and up. Incorporating factual material, this narrative explains the relationship between displaced water and volume of an object in a story-like manner. Without mentioning specific principles, physics and geometry are introduced, along with his inventions such as \"catapults.\" In historical context, listeners learn how people lived 23 centuries ago. This aids listeners in remembering facts still relevant in mathematics. Galileo and the Stargazers creates an historical time-line from Ptolemy to Newton. With distinctive voices, he projects emotion and intensity along with scientists' discoveries to sculpt unique characters. Listeners with knowledge of medieval history will find the details memorable such as Brahe mapping out 777 stars before the invention of the telescope, or Girodano Bruno sentenced to burn at the stake by the Catholic inquisition for his scientific beliefs. With no teacher's guide, bibliographic references or specific reading suggestions, use as an instructional tool depends upon the teacher. Whether augmenting the curriculum or for personal enjoyment, the author's ability to marry history with storytelling is successful.",

        "Narrating and voicing all the characters, master storyteller Jim Weiss turns historic icons of the sciences into real people, weaving the thrill of discovery into a tapestry of enchantment with tales about great thinkers who changed the world: Archimedes, Copernicus, Galileo, and Isaac Newton.

        "Jim Weiss is not only an exceptional narrator, he's a gifted writer, as well. GALILEO AND THE STARGAZERS dramatizes the work of Ptolemy, Kepler and the Italian master himself as they slowly pieced together the mysteries of the heavens. It also includes the famous story of Archimedes's naked sprint through the streets after discovering the principle of buoyancy in his bath. Weiss uses clear language without dumbing down the grand ideas. Accents and unique voices aren't his strong point, and a few of his choices are odd or cloying, but these are few. Mostly the reader is coaxed into the story by Weiss's own endearingly smooth delivery. D.B. © AudioFile 2000, Portland, Maine--",
