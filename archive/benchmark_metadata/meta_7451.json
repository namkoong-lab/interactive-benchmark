        "Emmy is a typical suburban mother--at least on the outside. On the inside she's a mess. She's trying to raise her three sons alone, and that is proving to be a discouraging struggle. Her oldest, Nick, is profoundly autistic and increasingly frustrated with the world around him. Henry, her normally dependable middle child seems to be drifting away from her into morose adolescence. And then there's Dan, her eight-year-old who seems perpetually angry at everyone in the family. Emmy's estranged husband Eric is no help at all, just a weekend dad who pops in when he's not wanted and takes the boys out for fast food or visits to the Science Museum. Emmy's haven from it all is her garden, and her dream is to start a landscape design business. But lack of time and energy keep her stuck selling real estate--it is all Emmy can do just to keep her life under control. When a flirtation, a brush with the law and a near tragedy occur within a few weeks of each other, Emmy is certain that she has failed adulthood completely. Dirt presents a portrait of complicated relationships and the ways that people find refuge--and each other."

Senator is the author of one novel \"Dirt: A Story About Gardening, Mothering, and Other Messy Business,\" and two autism parenting books, \"Making Peace With Autism: One Family\\'s Story of Struggle, Discovery, and Unexpected Gifts,\" and \"The Autism Mom\\'s Survival Guide: Creating a Happy and Balanced Life While Raising a Child With Autism.\" Senator\\'s third book is \"Autism Adulthood: Insights and Creative Strategies for a Fulfilling Life.\" She began her writing career in 1984, as an escape, while working on her Master\\'s Thesis at the University of Pennsylvania. She ultimately wrote four novels, and in 1997 published her first autism parenting article in Exceptional Parent Magazine. This led to many, many articles on various aspects of autism, parenting, and family life in places like The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and The Washington Post, all of which, along with her blog, can be found at susansenator.com. Senator has appeared on the Today Show, CNN, MSNBC, and NPR\\'s Weekend America. She was also a guest at a dinner at the White House in honor of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Special Olympics, where she met the President. Senator\\'s first book, \"Making Peace With Autism,\" was given the Exceptional Parent Magazine Award of Distinction. Senator\\'s philosophy is that it is certainly possible to have a happy family life even given the difficult context of autism -- it\\'s just not what you might have expected.']}"
