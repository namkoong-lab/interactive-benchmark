        "'I don't have my headphones on yet, but the music is always in there. I have a constant walking soundtrack to my life you see. There is a song for everything.' In the decade of grunge and Britpop, 13 year old Danny is a music fan in the making. He is also on a mission to deter unsuitable men from his beautiful single mother. With his best friends behind him, a soundtrack in his head and first love on the horizon, things are looking good, until local nightclub owner Lee Howard comes on the scene and sweeps Danny's mother off her feet. What do you do when your mother is dating a real life monster and no one can see it but you? A dark and powerful drama about friendship, music and the choice between escaping and fighting back."

        "Review",
        "\"This is the second book that I've read by Atkins, and I must say I am so impressed with her storytelling and writing skills. This book had me from the beginning. I was so wondering what was going on with the knife ... and I wasn't disappointed. Written in first person, it gives a great insight into what was going to happen next, and most importantly, why. I love this story. I'm glad I made the time to sit and read this, as I only put it down when I had to. It's so interesting to read what was going on inside the rage, the anger, the living only to fight. It was an amazing book, and I may just read it again, in case I missed something.\" - Amy's Bookshelf Reviews\"I thought Stephen King was the only author capable of such exquisite and escalating tension. Ms. Atkins matches him, and she does not require the supernatural for her terror. Danny is The Boy With the Thorn in His Side - a complex young man whose horrid fate comes in disguise: a new fella for his mother, a nightmare for himself... The buildup to the inevitably stunning climax is perfectly timed, with a unique soundtrack constantly accentuating this gripping story, along with characters so well articulated you expect to meet them in person, and absolutely pitch-perfect dialogue. This is my favorite book to date by this incredibly skilled writer.\" - Author Joel R. Dennstedt\"It's not a short book but it is a compelling page-turner. Atkins' writing is raw, intense, immediate, like a Nirvana song or a gritty film. It never lets up.\" Author Kate Rigby",
        "About the Author",
        "I never decide or aim to write about anything in particular, instead I am at the mercy of the characters who enter my head, set up home and start talking. Their stories start to unfold, their voices get louder, and writing begins. I would describe my books as very character driven, and propelled forward by dialogue. To me, the characters are everything. If you cannot make a reader care about the characters, then a fantastic plot is worthless in my opinion. My work has been described as gritty, compelling, intense and emotional. If I can make a reader shed a tear or two, then I feel I have done my job. As for genre, I suppose the best category to slot me in would be realist fiction."
