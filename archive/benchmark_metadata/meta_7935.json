        "The Warm Kitchen is a cookbook filled with gluten-free recipes anyone can make and everyone will love. It will provide you with cooking techniques and tips, step-by-step instructions, family friendly dishes, and beautiful photos illustrating the recipes. If living gluten-free makes you feel like you are missing out on some of your favorite foods, then this book is for you. With over 150 recipes ranging from breakfast to dessert, the dishes use real ingredients, are approachable, and most importantly, are absolutely delicious. Amy demystifies the assumption that cooking gluten-free is hard or not flavorful. By using a single gluten-free flour blend that is easy to mix up, you can learn to cook some of your favorite dishes like bagels, bread, zucchini pancakes, chicken pot pie, crispy yet chewy pizza, doughnuts, vanilla cupcakes, shortbread, carrot cake, chocolate chip cookies, and more. Amy understands cooking for multiple allergens and includes excellent substitutions for dairy, eggs, and sugar. Her number one goal is that you are as successful as she has been with creating dishes for yourself, friends or family. She says when you pick up this book, I want you to feel like you have come in to my kitchen; the warmth comes from both the oven as well as my heart. Welcome to The Warm Kitchen."

        "You can see what's cooking in The Warm Kitchen, because this cookbook serves up photos for each recipe on every glossy page. I prefer cookbooks with pictures and this one has lots of them. I'm not gluten-free, but enjoy recipes with a variety of grains, veggies and proteins, so it's nice to have Amy's recipes at my fingertips for inspiration. I have sampled many of her dishes and she makes gluten-free delicious, regardless of whether you follow a gluten-free diet. --amazon.comThis book is filled with pictures and recipes that I refer to almost every day. All the recipes are straightforward, and are perfect for family meals. I find it very inspiring. There's a wonderful dessert section, too, including a few GF versions of some Italian favorites, plus several classic cookie recipes that are my daughter's favorites. --amazon.comThis cookbook is so easy to follow. Amy explains everything in detail and her Chef Tips are extremely helpful. There are both simple recipes for those that didn't cook at home much until they had to because of their illness as well as complex recipes (that Amy still makes seem simply) that can be served when guests are in town. Definitely the best gluten free cookbook out there! --amazon.com",
