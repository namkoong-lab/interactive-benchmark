On a personal note, Sally does believe the Hokey Pokey IS what it’s all about!', 'Sally Aderton\\'s perspective on healing has come from a life-long pursuit of knowledge, her passion for Creation, the quest for her health and wellness, and staying true to herself to be whom she came to the planet to be. Sally received a Bachelor of Science from Northern Illinois University in Anthropology with minors in Sociology and Woman’s studies in 1983. She received a Masters of Liberal Arts from Naropa University in Creation Spirituality in 2001. Her thesis, \"Forgiveness: A Path to Peace,\" was based on over a decade of experience helping clients heal the pain in their lives by a process she designed. Between those degrees, she earned what she jokingly calls her ‘PhD in Healing’ surviving an Acoustic Neuroma brain tumor.', 'Sally credits her Methodist minister, James Scorgie as her first spiritual teacher. For her confirmation into the church in 1975, Rev. Scorgie used Microcosm, a self-awareness workshop in a book to teach the class about who they as individuals were in the context of the world. Sally taught her first self-awareness workshop in Chicago at 18-years-old in 1979 at the Annual State Student Council Convention, \"You Where it All Begins.\" Sally started her business Intuitive Arts & Sciences in 1985. Always she is relentless in the quest for discovering her mystic path.', 'Sally has counseled and taught worldwide from the beginning of her business.

Sally has been a guest lecturer on consciousness and self-awareness for corporations, organizations, schools and universities including Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland.', 'In addition to her healing practice, Sally is a Licensed California Realtor. She offers business marketing consulting services helping organizations with authentic creative panache. She does not limit what she does, where she does it, for whom she does it, when she does it (with the exception being limited to time zones ; ), how she does it as long as she feels she can benefit, and always knowing that why she does is to help with the love she is. Sally lives in California, a Mecca for innovation, and is the land that calls her soul home.']}"
