        "An enduring mystery in Mark Twain’s life concerns the events of his last decade, from 1900 to 1910. Despite many Twain biographies, no one has ever determined exactly what took place during those final years after the death of Twain’s wife of thirty-four years and how those experiences affected him, personally and professionally. For nearly a century, it was believed that Twain went to his death a beloved, wisecracking iconoclastic American (“I am not",
        "an",
        "American,” Twain wrote; “I am",
        "the",
        "American”), undeterred by life’s sorrows and challenges. Laura Skandera Trombley, the preeminent Twain scholar at work today, suspected that there had to be more to the story than the cultivated, carefully constructed version that had been intact for so long. Trombley went in search of the one woman whom she suspected had played the largest role in Twain’s life during those final years and who possibly held the answers to her questions about Twain’s life and writings. Now, in",
        "Mark Twain’s Other Woman",
        ", after sixteen years of research, uncovering never-before-read papers and personal letters, Trombley tells the full story through Isabel Lyon’s meticulous daily journals, the only detailed record of Twain’s last years that exists, journals overlooked by Twain’s previous biographers.For one hundred years, Isabel Van Kleek Lyon has been the mystery woman in Mark Twain’s life. Twain spent the bulk of his last six years in the company of Isabel, who was responsible for overseeing his schedule and finances, nursing him through several illnesses, managing his increasingly unmanageable daughters, running his household, arranging amusements, as well as presiding over the construction of his final residence. Isabel Lyon also served as Twain’s adoring audience (she called him “the King”), listening attentively as he read aloud to her what he’d written that day. She was Twain’s gatekeeper to an enthralled public. Trombley writes about what happened between them that resulted in the dramatic breakup of their relationship; about",
        "how, in Twain’s final months, he gave bitter, angry press conferences denouncing her; how he ranted in personal letters that she had injured him, calling her, “a liar, a forger, a thief, a hypocrite, a drunkard, a sneak, a humbug, a traitor, a conspirator, a filthy-minded & salacious slut pining for seduction.” Trombley writes that Twain’s invective bordered on obsession (he wrote about Isabel for hours every day, even while suffering from angina pains and gout attacks) and about how, despite the inordinate attention he gave her before his death, Isabel Lyon has remained a friendless ghost haunting the margins of Twain’s biography. For decades, biographers deliberately omitted her from the official Twain story. Her potentially destructive power was so great that Twain’s handpicked hagiographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, allowed only one timorous reference to her in his massive three-volume work,",
        "Mark Twain: A Biography",
        "(1912). Isabel Lyon was a forgotten woman, “so private,” she wrote in her journal, “that the very mention of me [was] with held from the world. . .”This riveting, dark story that “the King” determined no one would ever tell is now revealed at last."

        "Question:",
        "Who was Isabel Van Kleek Lyon and why don’t we know more about her?",
        "Laura Skandera Trombley:",
        "Isabel was Mark Twain’s confidant, personal assistant and social secretary during the last years of his life. She is a relative unknown in Twain scholarship because of a falling out that she had with Mark Twain and his two daughters, Clara and Jean. Because of her access to the family--she lived in the same home with Twain during her six years with him--she knew the family’s secrets and they eventually resorted to blackmailing her to guarantee that she would never attempt to claim a place in his life. Subsequent biographers either knew that the family was very opposed to any mention of Isabel or they ignored her due to her working class status and gender. Also, Twain wrote a scandalous fictionalized document about her that some biographers have mistakenly taken as truth.",
        "Question:",
        "What was the nature of Isabel’s relationship with Mark Twain?",
        "Laura Skandera Trombley:",
        "The two were emotionally intimate confidants. Isabel was charged with handling every aspect of Mark Twain’s life. Isabel decided who was allowed to see Twain, what he would eat, what he would wear, etc. Twain was utterly dependent upon her--physically, intellectually and emotionally--and he suffered enormously after he was forced by his daughters to fire her.",
        "Question:",
        "In this book, you draw on primary documents by and about Isabel that have not been explored before. How did you come across them?",
        "Laura Skandera Trombley:",
        "I did primary research for 16 years, traveled from coast to coast working in archives and historical societies, and did a much closer examination of Isabel’s papers than any previous Twain scholar. I discovered that the Vassar College archive held half of Isabel’s journal and the Mark Twain Papers at UC Berkeley had the other half. I am the only Twain scholar who has ever read all of Isabel’s writings. Several years ago, I met with Isabel’s relatives and they released letters and photographs to me that no scholar had previously seen.",
        "Question:",
        "Why have these papers not previously been brought to light?",
        "Laura Skandera Trombley:",
        "The first Twain scholars were aware that there had been a great deal of unpleasantness in the family during those final years (although they didn’t know what it was about) and didn’t want to air unflattering family secrets. Also Twain’s daughter Clara lived until the early 1960s and there was no possibility that any mention could have been made of Isabel while Clara was still alive due to the animosity she felt toward her father’s former secretary. Subsequent biographers simply accepted the cover story that Twain created; he was a genius, after all, and one of our finest fiction writers, and they were predisposed not to pay much attention to a pink-collar worker’s writings.",
        "Question:",
        "How would you characterize Twain’s relationships with women? It’s clear from your book that he relied upon women immensely, yet he managed to alienate his daughters Clara and Jean and viciously turned against Isabel.",
        "Laura Skandera Trombley:",
        "As an individual who was obsessed with control, Twain in his last years found himself for the first time in a situation that he could not directly influence through the strength of his sheer will or force of his personality. Jean, his youngest daughter, was very ill with severe epilepsy and no matter the amount of railing Twain did against man and God, the situation was not going to change. Clara, his middle daughter, is a turn-of-the-century example of the perils of being the child of the most famous man in the world, and she was every bit as iconoclastic as her father. Isabel really was an intelligent, desperate woman, determined to improve her social station in life. While Twain cared for them all, in the end his narcissism prevailed and he painstakingly constructed the way he would be remembered by the public. To achieve that end, he sacrificed those closest to him.",
        "Question:",
        "Isabel has been cast in many lights: a social climber, a \"new woman\" with career ambitions, a faithful companion and Mark Twain himself once, late in their relationship, called her a \"salacious slut.\" After writing this book, what is your own opinion of Isabel? What is the most important thing that you wish to set straight in her historical record?",
        "Laura Skandera Trombley:",
        "Isabel was an intelligent woman trapped by historical circumstance. She was born to the upper middle class and, due to the deaths of her father, uncle, and brother, she was forced to enter into service. She was shrewd enough to know that her options were limited and she was not satisfied to serve the rest of her life as a nanny or secretary. With that said, she was also genuinely fond of Twain and was his greatest admirer. She showed the most decency among all of the people involved by forgiving Twain’s many wrongs toward her. Those who might cast her as a scarlet woman or sycophant fail to understand how difficult life was for women like Isabel at the time, and how she managed to move forward with her life despite many, many disappointments.",

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "In this book on Twain's last decade and his complicated relationship with his secretary, Isabel Lyon, Trombley is often too much the professor—quoting overlong passages when summary and interpretation would be better. An otherwise informative epilogue rambles. But when Trombley hits her stride, we learn quite a lot of the Twain household's secrets. Lyon wormed her way into Twain's life in the late 1880s as his favorite whist partner. Upon realizing the worth of Twain's letters, she obtained full power of attorney. She feuded with his hot-tempered daughter Clara over who would be in charge of his affairs. But the manipulative Lyon also truly loved the King, and in his loneliness after his wife's death, he was responsive. Twain's ultimate falling out with Lyon, including Twain's charges that she made unwanted sexual advances to him, make for painful reading and will be controversial. 43 photos.",

        "In his Mark Twain, Man in White (2009), Michael Sheldon follows a great author as he forges a luminous public image. In this provocative study, Trombley illuminates a woman—Isabel Van Kleek Lyon—whom Twain deliberately shoves into the shadows to protect his image. For six years his personal secretary, Lyon helps Twain with various professional concerns and with a family life complicated by one daughter’s epilepsy and by another daughter’s tempestuous amours. But readers see how bitter intrafamily conflict exposes Lyon to the wrath of Twain’s oldest surviving daughter, who views Lyon and her ambitious husband as threats, and how Twain’s carefully selected official biographer outmaneuvers her as a guardian of literary papers. Though not all readers will go as far as Trombley in crediting Lyon’s version of events, readers will confront considerable evidence that Twain cares more about shielding himself from negative publicity than about truth or fairness when he dismisses Lyon and subsequently heaps abuse upon her name. A strong challenge to the iconic image of an iconoclast. --Bryce Christensen",

        "THE LATE 1880s TO FALL1905Today has been very full of the joy of living—I wrote letters and read some in the morning. Looked out of my window just in Time to see Dear Mother look up at me on her way home from Church and in the afternoon she came over. Later I played cards with my chief. Some day the penalty for having such perfect living will come.—ISABEL VAN  KLEEK LYON1By all rights no one should have ever heard of Samuel Langhorne Clemens. He should have lived and died a cipher of rural nineteenth-century America. Certainly his modest beginnings presaged a difficult, abbreviated existence. Yet life takes unexpected turns, and the course that his journey took as Mark Twain would have strained the credulity of the most dedicated fiction reader.Born two months prematurely, red-haired Samuel Langhorne Clemens arrived to his parents, thirty-two-year-old Jane Lampton Clemens and thirty-seven-year-old John Marshall Clemens, on November 30, 1835. His birthplace was a tiny two-bedroom rented cabin with an outdoor lean-to kitchen in the village of Florida in Monroe County, Missouri, located at a fork of the Salt River. He joined four young siblings: ten-year-old Orion, eight-year-old Pamela, five-year-old Margaret, and three-year-old Benjamin. Another brother, Pleasant, had died in infancy six years earlier. For a time it looked as though he would suffer Pleasant’s fate. No one in his family much expected him to survive. His mother later wrote, “he was a poor looking object to raise.” Of Florida, Twain joked that the dusty little settlement “contained a hundred people and I increased the population by 1 per cent. It is more than many of the best men in history could have done for a town. It may not be modest in me to refer to this, but it is true. There is no record of a person doing as much—not even Shakespeare. But I did it for Florida, and it shows that I could have done it for any place—even London, I suppose.” Yet in the midst of these decidedly inauspicious surroundings, there was an augury that hinted that this child just might be special. For weeks prior to his birth, the bright trail of Halley’s Comet crossed the nighttime sky.After a departing shower of sparks and the passage of years, interest in the comet’s appearance receded. But not so for Jane Clemens, who told and retold the story of the mysterious visitation and how it foretold great things, and most important, not for Twain, who by the end of his life embraced the notion that Halley’s Comet had heralded his coming. He possessed a strong affinity for the celestial body, expressing his hope that he would make his exit when it returned during its seventy-five-year cycle: “I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year (1910), and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don’t go out with Halley’s Comet.”Maybe Twain felt that a passing comet provided the best explanation for his remarkable life. That this son of Missouri would grow up to be the most famous author in the world and the first global celebrity was so implausible that even Twain had difficulty making sense of his rise: “The Almighty has said, no doubt: ‘Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.’ ” The accomplishments of this “freak” were so many and his fame so enormous that by the end of his life he had come to be considered by those who knew him well as otherworldly. According to a close friend, “He always seemed to me like some great being from another planet—never quite of this race or kind.”The family failed to prosper in Florida, and so in 1839 they moved twenty-eight miles northeast, to the bustling riverside town of Hannibal, Missouri, in Marion County. The little boy quickly adapted to his new surroundings and acquired a closely knit group of friends. His boyhood adventures exploring the environs of Hannibal with Tom Blankenship and Laura Hawkins would later be immortalized in his most beloved works,",

Two years later, he traveled north working as an itinerant typesetter in Saint Louis, Philadelphia, and New York City. After a few years spent wandering, he decided he would travel to South America to sail the Amazon and make his fortune in “COCA, a vegetable product of miraculous powers,” which he had read, in a book about the Amazon, “was so nourishing and so strength-giving that the native of the mountains of the Madeira region would tramp up hill and down all day on a pinch of the powdered coca and require no other sustenance.” His plan was to travel by river from Cincinnati to New Orleans and then set sail for Pará (a port city in northern Brazil), where he would establish himself in the lucrative cocaine trade.While on board ship he met Horace Bixby, a legendary riverboat pilot. By the time he disembarked in New Orleans, plans for South America had been abandoned in favor of working for Bixby. Bixby had agreed to mentor the young man and they worked together on the Mississippi River from 1857 to 1861. On April 9, 1859, Twain received his steamboat pilot’s license. Working as a pilot brought him not just increased income, but an enhanced social status. To the end of his life, he would regard earning his pilot’s license as one of his proudest accomplishments.

Twain was immediately attracted to the well-educated, wealthy, pretty young woman, and after a year-and-a-half-long courtship, the two were married, on February 2, 1870, in the parlor of the Langdon mansion in Elmira.A decade younger than her husband, Olivia proved to be Twain’s ideal companion.

This period constituted the happiest time of Twain’s life. The Clemenses spent their winters in Hartford and summered in Elmira, at Susan Crane’s home, Quarry Farm. Susan was Olivia’s older sister, and it was there that Twain did most of his writing.To those around him, Twain possessed a seemingly endless amount of energy. His intense intellectual curiosity compelled him to crisscross the globe (he sailed the Atlantic Ocean twenty-nine times) and to amass an enormous personal library with thousands of volumes. He was an individual who craved conversation, and he flourished as the center of attention. For Twain, dialogue was everything, and it is estimated that he wrote fifty thousand letters over the course of his lifetime in addition to more than three thousand newspaper and magazine articles and more than thirty books. His creative capacity appeared limitless, and when he was not writing he talked. The only impossibility, it seemed, was for Twain not to express himself. He was so confident of ...",
