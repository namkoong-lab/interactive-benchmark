        "(Limelight). Now available in paperback, this compilation by longtime New York Times music and arts critic John Rockwell features the creme de la creme of the renowned journalist's arts criticism and commentary over the past 40 years. Taken mostly from the Times , but also including pieces from 17 other sources, such as the Los Angeles Times , The New Republic , the San Francisco Examiner , High Fidelity , Opera , and the Village Voice , these writings present Rockwell's unique vision of the arts scene over the past 40 years, with essays on classical music (including the breadth of contemporary works), rock, dance, art, film, theater, general arts topics, and reports from abroad. Rockwell's analysis includes parallels among the arts, insights from one to another, as he brilliantly communicates his aesthetic experiences to the reader."

        "Review",
        "\"Has any other practicing critic covered more territory over the last 40 years than John Rockwell?...As practical journalism, his assessments have much to admire; they are consistently judicious, knowledgeable, generous and balanced. This book also provides a valuable record of the cultural period through which we have just passed: an enthusiastic verbal snapshot album of everyone from Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen to Shostakovich and Mark Morris.\" - Phillip Lopate, The New York Times Book Review \"Hardly anyone writing on the arts in recent decades has shown Rockwell's breadth of interests and taste, nor his sheer intelligence, whether his subject be Philip Glass, the Sex Pistols or Mikhail Baryshnikov. This is a book to be savored.\" - Michael Anthony, Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune\" --Michael Anthony, Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune",
