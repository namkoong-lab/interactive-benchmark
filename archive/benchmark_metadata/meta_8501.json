        "About the Author",
        "\"The Horse Leads the Way proposes that honoring the central and true role of the horses is the key to this method being effective, and to ensuring the horses' well-being is maintained throughout. In the approach put forward in this book, the horses are regarded as sentient beings in their own right and equal partners who employ choices and offer suggestions for how to lead the sessions, rather than being a 'tool' for people to use and learn from. Throughout the book vital key abilities that horses can primarily help people reawaken and develop are emphasized. These include: emotional intelligence, intuition, energetic awareness, healthy relationships, mindfulness, presence, and above all, a deep connection to one's own body; that much maligned part of human life in our mind-orientated world. The book is aimed at practitioners, trainees, clients, horse lovers, equine-psychotherapy, therapy, and learning professionals, as well as therapists, educators and coaches. It is also for anyone interested in understanding the horse-human relationship more deeply and in learning from horses.\" Angela Dunning is a sensitive, intuitive horsewoman; seasoned Equine Facilitated Learning (EFL) practitioner and a writer. A graduate of Eponaquest® Worldwide, Angela established her EFL practice The Horse's Truth in 2007 (formerly called Equine Reflections). She delivers private sessions, workshops and talks to the public and professional training and support for practitioners. She specializes in supporting people to reconnect to their true essence; heal lifelong limiting patterns and to live in alignment with their soul. Angela lives in Shropshire, England and delivers her work in the UK and abroad. Her website is: thehorsestruth.co.uk"

A lifelong lover of animals, nature and most particularly horses, she has a deep intuitive understanding of and connection to animals and all of the natural world. Angela is a writer; an intuitively sensitive horsewoman and a consummate holder of sacred space which allows people to gently rediscover their true-selves and heal from the past. She has worked for many years both with horses and people in a variety of capacities and environments. After completing her training with bestselling author Linda Kohanov in Arizona, she has worked for the past 16 years in the rapidly evolving world of horses helping people to learn and heal, through delivering equine facilitated learning to individuals, groups and other practitioners. In her first book 'The Horse Leads the Way: Honoring the True Role of the Horse in Equine Facilitated Practice', she has outlined her sensitive approach to partnering with horses, in which she demonstrates how the professionals can best support their clients AND their equine partners. Angela lives in the delightful town of Bishop's Castle in Shropshire, England, where she works both locally and elsewhere on invitation, as well as online. She specialises in supporting other practitioners through further development training, supervision and mentoring.
