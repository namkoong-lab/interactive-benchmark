In fact, she was a quite an excellent liar and decided early on that she’d rather live in her own head than the real world. Born in Antigua, British West Indies, she has had a lifelong love affair with haunted houses, lonesome beaches and forgotten places. She currently lives on the Gulf Coast and regularly haunts her favorite hangout, Dauphin Island and downtown Mobile. A visit to Historic Oakleigh House in Mobile, Alabama inspired her successful supernatural suspense Seven Sisters series.', 'Follow M. L.
