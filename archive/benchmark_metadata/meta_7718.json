        "Epicureanism theorizes an infinite universe of moving particles, with no divine purpose and no life after death. Happiness depends on simple needs satisfied to provide tranquility of mind. This volume presents a comprehensive collection of the surviving works and wise sayings of Epicurus together with the great systematic account of Epicurean natural science in Lucretius's ON THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE."

        "From the Publisher",
        "Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic's introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman's uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards."
