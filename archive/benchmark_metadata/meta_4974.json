        "In the Pokemon Trading Card Game, players build decks around their favorite Pokemon and then play against each other, sending their Pokemon into battle to prove who the best Pokemon Trainer is. Players can begin with theme decks - pre-constructed decks designed to cover the basics of the game. Then, they can augment their card collections with booster packs that provide more cards, letting players develop more diverse decks. With thousands of cards to choose from, the game is never the same twice.",
