        "About the Author",
        "Anne B. Walsh has been telling stories from the time she could talk, but it took her twenty years to realize she could make a living at it. She left her office job on a leap of faith two months before seeing a PBS special which changed her life. The resulting four-book series of historical fantasy romances is known collectively as the Chronicles of Glenscar (or will be, when it involves more than one book!). Anne lives east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with her roommate Krystal. They are owned by a pair of needy, and kneady, cats named Poppy and Sesame. Her parents and siblings live two hours north, otherwise known as just far enough away. She has been writing Harry Potter fan fiction for almost eight years and is known best in that genre as the creator of the \"Dangerverse\" alternate universe. Beyond writing fiction, Anne's preoccupations include reading fiction; singing anywhere that will have her, including her church and local galas; theatre, especially musicals; all forms of cooking; and her family and friends. Within writing fiction, her preoccupations are much the same, meaning most of her stories involve loving families, delicious food, and good music. Consider yourself warned. A number of projects are awaiting Anne's attention now that she has completed her first original novel. Among these are the final novel-length work in the Dangerverse, \"Surpassing Danger\", and her first personal anthology, \"Cat Tales\", a collection of short fiction featuring cats and cat-like beings, including a short prequel to \"A Widow in Waiting\" and a story from her original Trycanta universe.
