        "In Doodle Town, everyone and everything is a drawing! Children can transform the world with just a pencil and an idea in this wonderfully whimsical activity book that lets them discover how much fun drawing and doodling can be. Budding artists will revel in the opportunity to bend reality with their doodles—create designs for a fantastical fleet of cards, for gravity-defying hairstyles, and release scribble clouds into the sky (who knows what kind of rain a scribble makes?!), and play mix-and-match with Doodle Town dog owners. Packed with more than 60 drawing activities, and including large flaps with removable stencil sheets,",
        "Doodle Town",
        "is an entertaining and empowering introduction to imaginative drawing."
