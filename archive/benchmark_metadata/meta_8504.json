        "Ever'one knows ah Juggin Joe from the now famous \"Juggin Joe an' his Buckboard Band\", but I don't think they's many that know how he got tah where hes at tahday. Well, I've knowed Joe pert near his whole durn life an' the parts I didn'a personally witness he done told me 'bout hisself, which Id say is 'bout as good a source as a feller can hope tah achieve. So I reckon that I can tell his stahry jes' 'bout as well as anyone, 'cept fer maybe Joe hissself, an' as he don't appear inclined fer the tellin', I s'pose that leaves it up tah me, 'cause the stahry's best tah be told as 'posed tah not...",
        "Anyway, I thought I'd give 'er a whirl an' see what happens. Those parts that ain't nobody's business will ah course be left out. There ain't no point in anyone askin' me 'bout them neither cause I ain'tah gonna tell. Truth is, they ain't none ah muh business neither but bein' as me an' Joe are good friends, an' friends bein' what they are, there ain't too much that one don't know 'bout the other. So, though I'm generally considered a man ah few words, I'll wind 'er up, give a kick an' a pull, an' see what comes out.",
        "Now, afore we go any further with the stahry, they's one final thin' yah best come tah grips with here an' now. Hillfolk an' flatlanders gen'rally unnerstan one 'nother well 'nuff, but don't always speak an' write the same way. An' jes' cause sumptins diff'rent, don't mean it's bad er wrong. Hillfolk tend tah take life a little slower, an' with less fermal'ty than most city slickers. So, as yah work yer way through this here stahry, muh spellin might be a skaint off the mark, er maybe a word er two'll have yah ponderin' what I'm talkin' 'bout. I'd recommend yah jes' let it on in, lead yah where it will, an' thins'll git along fine fer the both ah us.",
        "Now then, Juggin Joe, er jes' plain Joe, as those that've known him the longes' calls 'im, wuz born the tenth ah eleven young'uns. His paw, Doc Jeckel, wuz a man ah some local repute b'cause ah his musical abilities. Doc weren't no doctahr a'tall but somehow had acquired the nickname \"Doc\", an' it stuck. Joe's maw, Isabel, wuz a powerful han'some woman in her youth an' considered quite a catch. Her family, the Hides, were thought tah be old stock from Germ'ny, what come here a number ah generations back. Other'n that, the Hide family background wuz mostly unknown, shrouded in mystery deeper'n the caverns ah Cobleskill.",
        "Doc an' Isabel both come from meager families, so neither ah them had much in the way ah money fer startin out in life. But not too many did back then, an' the lack thereah weren't considered too long a row tah hoe. As they say, the Good Lord'll provide, an' I suppose truth be told, he does, leastways fer the necessities in life as they be. An' b'sides, we all knowed that money didn'a equate tah everlastin' feelins ah happiness fer folks no how...",
        "Doc an' Miss Isabel married young, as is customary up in the hills. I wuz there fer the weddin' muhself an' it wuz as good an affair as the lack ah money would allow. People come from all over tah see the happy union ah what wuz gen'rally considered a good match, tho I can recall one er two that speculated that the joinin' ah Doc Jeckel an' Miss Hide might well have \"monstrous p'tential fer one an' all\", without goin' intah any more details ah why that might be so. If'n that declaration weren't a powerful notion ah forbodin', an' maybe a touch ah clairvoyance as tah what wuz tah come fer the fam'ly, then I ain't a true blue man ah the hills."
