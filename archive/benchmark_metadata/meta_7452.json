        "Charles Longfellow, son of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, arrived in Yokohama in 1871, intending a brief visit, and stayed for two years. He returned to Boston laden with photographs, curios, and art objects, as well as the elaborate tattoos he had “collected” on his body. His journals, correspondence, and art collection dramatically demonstrate America’s early impressions of Japanese culture, and his personal odyssey illustrates the impact on both countries of globetrotting tourism.Interweaving Longfellow’s experiences with broader issues of tourism and cultural authenticity, Christine Guth discusses the ideology of tourism and the place of Japan within nineteenth-century round-the-world travel. This study goes beyond simplistic models of reciprocal influence and authenticity to a more synergistic account of cross-cultural dynamics."

        "\"A readable, instructive and intellectually inspiring inquiry into a late-nineteenth-century trans-Pacific relationship. As a cultural biographhy of Charles Longfellow alone, it is of great value. Moreover, Guth's writing is gripping..[A] magnificent accomplishment from the frontiers of cross-cultural studies.\"―",

        "Review",
        "\"A deep pleasure to read for both scholar and non―scholar, Guth’s study of Longfellow’s life in Japan is an exemplary, provocative, and highly important work of cultural studies.\"―Jay Fliegelman, William Robertson Coe Professor of American Literature and Culture, Stanford University",
        "\"That Christine Guth, one of the most productive and respected scholars of Japanese art, has turned her rich intellect and analytical prowess to curios, photographs, and tattoos collected by nineteenth―century globetrotters, suggests that the real Japanese art history has finally arrived.\"―Allen Hockley, associate professor of art history, Dartmouth College",
        "\"Guth deftly illuminates a special moment in Japanese and U.S. cultural history. By using as her touchstone the poignantly eccentric Charles Longfellow (son of the great Henry Wadsworth Longfellow), she adeptly positions episodes in Japanese and American history so they flesh out a heretofore only partially studied cultural dynamic. Each country is made to hold up a mirror to the other.\"―Melinda Takeuchi, professor of art and art history, Stanford University",
