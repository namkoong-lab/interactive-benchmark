        "Protect the girl…I’ve spent the last twenty-five years fulfilling the promise I made to my best friend on the eve of his death. They executed him for daring to fall for a human. I can’t imagine what they would do to the child had they known she existed. Which they never will.Half-human and half-vampire, she’s a hybrid of two worlds. Extremely rare, she’s something of myths and old wives’ tales. I cannot let them destroy her, even if it means losing everything—including my life.Desperate for a change…Raised by my Ya-ya, I never quite fit into the world around me. When I learned of an inheritance from the father I never knew, I jumped at the chance to learn something about myself.But soon I find things aren’t what they appear. My body is changing in ways I don’t understand. And the man…Alessandro. I know nothing about him. Except he excites me and terrifies me in the same breath. I should stay away from him. He’s dangerous. But I can’t, it’s as though my body craves him."
