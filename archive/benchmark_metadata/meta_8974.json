And once her grandfather reveals more of the prophecy linked to the sword, Hana learns she must train in the dojo like never before.",

But little does she know what lies ahead. Brittany’s old friends are still angry at Hana for “stealing” Brittany away, and have plans to get their revenge by framing Hana as a cheater. At the same time, fox warriors from the fantastical world of Argon Falls have returned through the portal and are intent on getting the spirit sword for their master, no matter the cost.",
        "And when her grandfather reveals Hana’s role in a prophecy that links Argon Falls and Earth, and one of Tomo’s secrets is revealed, Hana realizes her problems may have just begun.",
