        "Distilled Spirits blends a religion reporter's memoir with the compellingstories of three men--Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, and BillWilson--who transformed the landscape of Western religion andspirituality in the twentieth century. Huxley, celebrated author ofBrave New World, ignited a generation that chased utopian dreamsand sought enlightenment through psychedelic drugs. Heard, anAnglo-Irish mystic, journeyed to California with Huxley in the 1930sto lay the foundations for the New Age and human potentialmovements. Wilson, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, joinedforces with Huxley and Heard in the 1940s and 1950s, when Wilsonbegan a series of little-known experiments to see if LSD could be usedto help diehard drunks.Their life stories are gracefully brought together by veteran journalistDon Lattin. Lattin recounts his own rocky personal journey from1960s and 1970s counter-culture, through the fast-living, cocaine-fueled1980s and 1990s, to his long struggle to get sober. By weavingan intimate account of his own recovery with the lives of the book'sthree central characters, Lattin shows us the redemptive power of storytelling, the strength of fellowship, and the power of living morecompassionately, one day at a time."

        "“It is difficult for me to hide my enthusiasm for this book. It is a fascinating biography/memoir with an abundance of heart―courageously honest, philosophically nuanced, and peppered with the most delightful sense of humor. It’s easy to be romantic about drugs and mysticism―tougher to be both morally rigorous AND honestly ecstatic about the real openings they offer. I’m grateful that Lattin can hold this tension while also weaving a mesmerizing story.”―Jeffrey Kripal, author of",

        "\"The key figure in this 'blend of memoir and biography' is Lattin, whose narrative arc might be the strangest.
