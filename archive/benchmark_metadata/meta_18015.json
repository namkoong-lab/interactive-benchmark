At 11.5 oz (326 g) strung with an oversize 110-sq-in head, this frame carries plenty of power with some margin for error on strokes that miss the center of the string bed. Its aluminum composition lends a durable feel, and its extra length gives players more time to make a play on the next ball with extended court coverage. The sharp design and precision performance is inspired by the Pro Staff performance series of tennis racquets endorsed by Roger Federer.
