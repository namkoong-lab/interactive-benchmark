        "\"This epic tale spanning past and present will have you on the edge of your seat. Set in a world of Voodoo, spirits, and the historic locale of New Orleans, Villere House is deliciously spooky and romantic.\" ~ Tracey Garvis Graves, author of the New York Times bestseller, On The Island and Covet.The last thing college senior Lottie Boyd expected while on spring break in New Orleans was having strange, yet vivid dreams of a 19th century young widow, desperately trying to save her dying little girl. When doctors are unable to do more, the beautiful woman in Lottie’s dreams is forced to go beyond her beliefs for one last attempt. Compelled to find answers, Lottie is drawn toward the historic Villere House of Voodoo, where she meets the owner, Xavier Villere. She is attracted to his intriguing creole good looks, but his skepticism of his family's century-old link to Voodoo and the occult keep pushing her away. It isn’t until Xavier begins experiencing unexplainable events from his own past that he begins to understand why he must help Lottie with hers.Note: Villere House is adult romance and not suitable for readers under 18."

        "bestseller, On The Island and Covet.College senior, Lottie Boyd, expects to drink too much while on spring break in New Orleans. What she doesn't expect is to be haunted. Or fall in love. It starts with strange, vivid dreams about a 19th century widow so desperate to save her sick little girl, she's willing to do anything--even if it involves the black magic of Voodoo.It doesn't end there. Voices, ghost sightings, familiarity with things and places she couldn't possibly know... All leading her to the Villere House of Voodoo and the young Creole owner, Xavier Villere.Xavier is compelled to help and is drawn to Lottie in a way he's never known, but skepticism of his family's century-old link to Voodoo and the occult keep her at arms length. If he can only come to terms with his heritage, he might be able to help solve the mystery of the widow haunting Lottie's dreams. And maybe even find love in the process.Note: Villere House is an adult romance and not suitable for readers under 18.",
