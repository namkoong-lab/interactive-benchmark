        "What do a talking doughnut, a crabby politician, and a lovelorn balloon have in common? They're all citizens of the candy-colored knitted world known as Mochimochi Land. Adventures in Mochimochi Land started out as a collection of tiny knitted characters, but as the patterns grew they needed an entire world of their own, complete with knitted cities, knitted forests, knitted oceans, and most important, knitted friends! The book follows the adventures of a tiny knitted explorer, as he travels this unbelievably cute world and uncovers its strange yarn-based origins. For intrepid knitters, the book also includes a section with 25 all-new patterns for the characters and props used in the stories. The patterns use small amounts of yarn and beginner-friendly knitting skills and knit up quickly for instant fun."
