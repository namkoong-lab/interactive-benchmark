        "Born from the ashes of seminal Midwest emo bands Merchant Ships and Midwest Pen Pals, William Bonney is an angry, earnest expression of youth-a time capsule of love and loss colored by an all-consuming sense of heart. Despite their brief and volatile tenure as an active band, the songs of William Bonney persist and continue to find their way into the ears of listeners new and old, wide and far."
