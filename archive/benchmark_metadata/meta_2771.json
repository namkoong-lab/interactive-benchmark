        "Review",
        "This is the first book in this trilogy.It is written with great detail and draws upon ideas and customs that are antiquated, but very interesting. Dona pulls you into the story and makes you feel like you are part of the family. Depression Era events are discussed in a nostalgic manner. The house exudes mystery and intrigue and also brings strangers together as a family. Thank you, Dona for sharing these women's stories and the mystery of the house with us.",
