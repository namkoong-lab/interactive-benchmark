        "Here is the theological summary of one preacher’s lifetime of investment in a local church. Completing three decades of pastoral ministry at Bethlehem Baptist, John Piper gave a final sermon series on the doctrinal emphases from his years of preaching. These ten sermons, now edited for this volume, embody the legacy Piper hopes to leave.  But don’t think that these messages are the memoirs of a retired pastor. Don’t think that the truths found in these pages can be shelved away to collect dust. This vision of God doesn’t take a pat on the head—it turns the world upside down.  These doctrines are, as Piper says, “wildly untamable, explosively uncontainable, and electrically future–creating.” They make a difference. When you read these truths of our great God, you will want to act. You will want to build something. You will want to start things. You will be compelled to dream big and risk bigger for the glory of Jesus Christ. And we pray for nothing less."
