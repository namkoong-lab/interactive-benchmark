        "With a playful rhyme and exuberant line-and-watercolor pictures, this picture book will have toddlers cuddling with their caregivers (“After crawling, you can nap / Your tushy fits on every lap”) as they look at pictures of children using their tushies in daily activities: bouncing on the bed, rolling in the snow, splashing in the shower, spinning, and sledding (“Tushies small or tushies plump, pillow you on every bump”). The book includes an exciting visit to the zoo, which offers lots of backside views of elephants, giraffes, and monkeys. Then there is the toddler’s view of grown-up and baby bottoms at the beach. The climax is the kid on the potty: “I use my tushy / every day!” The sounds of the words are as much fun as the scenarios that celebrate the body and how it works, and kids will want to chant along with the infectious rhymes. A book to share and talk about. Preschool. --Hazel Rochman",

(Actually, 1972.) My first book, \"Baby\", later retitled \"Baby, Come Out,\" just came out in China! I love my work, and I’m particularly proud of my 45-book Katie Woo series: the first easy-to-read chapter books that star an Asian child. Now Katie\\'s friend Pedro has his own 8-book series. A few titles are \"Pedro and the Shark,\" \"Pedro Goes Buggy,\" \"Pedro the Ninja,\" and \"Pedro’s Big Goal\" (about soccer). Eight of the Pedro stories can be read, four to a volume, in \"Pedro: First Grade Hero\" and \"Pedro the Great.\" Many Pedro books are available in Spanish.', \"I’m also the author of “Happy In Our Skin,” a bouncy, rhyming tribute to skin and to diverse families. School Library Journal calls it “a delightful feel-good story.” It's available in hardcover and paperback from Candlewick and it's also available as a Scholastic paperback.\", 'My other books include the toilet-training board books, \"Big Girl Panties\" and \"Big Boy Underpants.\" They really work! \"Big Girl Panties has over 850 enthusiastic reader reviews! \"Big Boy Underpants,\" published later, has already been reprinted.', 'My other books include the popular new-sibling books, \"Big Sisters are the Best\" and \"Big Brothers are the Best.\" They are also coming out in China!', 'To find out more about the Katie Woo books, check this website for information and free downloadables: http://www.capstonekids.com/characters/Katie-Woo/', \"I love to do school or Skype visits and can be contacted through my Website:www.franmanushkin.com.
