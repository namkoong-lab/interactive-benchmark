        "This new book is a game-changer for entrepreneur-curious & entrepreneur-minded women Instead of delivering water to a thirsty community, this book shows you how to dig your own well so that you can provide for yourself. For now. For the rest of your life. It sets out to reposition entrepreneur-minded women within you. Thus empowered, this book will move you: * from paralysis to potential * from hostility to harmony * from fear to freedom * from stagnation to action * from shame & blame to power & mobility * from invisible to spectacular This book is unlike any other book ever written on the subject Oh, sure, there’s a plethora of books out there that promise you change. “If I can do it, so can you,” many of them tout, and they proceed to tell their stories. Of course, if that were true, then there would be a Disneyland on every street corner, Warren Buffet would have no secrets, there would be a hidden millionaire in every fry chef, and world peace would have arrived centuries ago because universal wealth would have long ago been achieved. This book is different, in that author Britt Santowski: => Respects YOU the reader, recognizing that your life’s experiences is what makes you the expert, the center. She doesn’t waste time showing you what’s wrong with you; she points you to all that can be right. => Views the challenge of becoming an entrepreneur exclusively through the eyes and experience of woman. Because, guess what, women ARE different. => Understands that change can only come when the fear of staying “here” is going to hurt more than your fear of fading into a permanent state of inconspicuity. => Prepares you to shift from a invisible “role” (mother, wife, daughter, employee) to a spectacular contributor in both your own life and your legacy with others => Takes you over the hurdle that it’s never too late. Even if you’re halfway through life, you’ve got a second half to fill. This book will help you fill it, momentously. => Shows you how to reach inside yourself, and discover and activate the power of your full potential. Learn about the three ultimate strategies that will help you structure an unshakable foundation of confidence and success While no book can guarantee your success (and RUN AWAY if one ever deigns to make such a promise!), this book gives you the three foundational strategies upon which you can structure your own success: Accountability, Collaboration and Initiative. The Three Strategies of the UNSTOPPABLE WOMAN will show you: * Why letting go of your inner VICTIM is critical for your future success, and why you need to walk away from her sweet cousin, BLAME * How to recognize and celebrate your inner genius (and yes, she is there) * Why having a definite major purpose is critical to your success * How you can easily expand your network and influence, by simply leveraging what you already have access to * What’s wrong with the Law of Attraction, and how you can avoid the pitfalls of woo-woo gurus * Concrete tools that will create an unstoppable momentum to guide you into a life of your creation After all, here’s the bottom line: You will spend more time dead than alive. Deciding to take control of your “alive time” puts you in the Director’s chair. The Three Strategies of the Unstoppable Woman will give you the three ultimate strategies that you can use to establish baseline confidence in whatever it is you choose to do with your life. This is NOT “Just Another Boring Business Book.” No business plans, no capital fundraising proposals, no spreadsheets. All that is yet to come. This is the book that precedes all others. If you don’t have the proper mind set, an unbreakable mental foundation, all the business tools in the world will not help you succeed. This book is about starting at the most logical place: The beginning. And if you didn’t start there, it’s never to late to back up!"

        "New Book Provides Women With Formula For Unstoppable Success",
        "Britt Santowski is the voice of the new Unstoppable Woman. Bridging the gap between women of the past and present, from women who were victims to women who are successful and empowered, Santowski uses her personal story and that of many other successful women, along with practical examples, inspirational stories, and a good dose of shrewd common sense to enlighten women about the requirements for success. \"The Three Strategies of the Unstoppable Woman\" is that book women have long awaited-a surefire guide to finding the required balance in life that leads both to goal-achievement and happiness.",
        "Having experienced violence and abuse, and having seen it in the lives of the women around her, Santowski makes a strong point early in the book that while violence exists in our world, women cannot accept the role of \"victim.\" Santowski has no problem taking on what does not work for women. While education is fine, she points out the educational system's limits, and she provides practical ways for women to determine what is the right goal, field of study, or career for them by exploring their passions and natural inclinations rather than doing what other people or society at large expects is best for them.",
        "At the heart of \"The Three Strategies of the Unstoppable Woman\" is the invaluable point that women need to support one another. Santowski encourages women, once they know where they want to go in life, to collaborate with each other rather than simply envy one another. She teaches women to transform their envy into the fuel to ignite their dreams. \"Envy is not a bad-news indicator that reflects something awful about you. Rather, it is a great-news indicator, telling you that you too can achieve this particular aspiration. All you have to do is to step out of your comfort zone and start moving toward it.\"",
        "One of my favorite sections of \"The Three Strategies of the Unstoppable Woman\" was the discussion of forming mastermind groups with like-minded women. While I have heard of mastermind groups before, I appreciated Santowski's simple guidelines for creating such circles, based on her own experiences participating and forming mastermind groups. As a male reader, I felt this information and so much more in the book was directly relevant to my own desires and goals, so I did not let the book's title stop me from absorbing all the priceless information included.",
        "Another favorite piece of advice I found was Santowski's statement that we need to change \"if\" to \"when\" in terms of what we desire. We need to assume something we want will happen and then imagine and plan for it. I especially appreciated her example in this case because she helped one of her male clients believe he would receive custody of his child, a situation that did become a \"when\" not an \"if\" and it illustrates that Santowski is understanding of men, rather than seeing them as the enemy. She makes a point of saying that she did truly believe in this particular situation that the child would be better off with the father. There is no man-bashing (or woman-bashing) in this book, but rather a sense that people can work together, regardless of sex or background, to make what they want into reality.",
        "Throughout the book, Santowski provides \"Call to Action\" sections to challenge the reader toward becoming unstoppable. The end of the book is filled with several excellent appendices, not just the usual list of references, but also inspirational quotes from such women as Eleanor Roosevelt and Helen Keller. My favorite appendix is the \"Famous Failures\" section that illustrates how people (men included) like Walt Disney, Betty Grable, Joan of Arc, and Benjamin Franklin, might have experienced perceived failure but still succeeded. As Santowski points out, failure only really happens when you give up. Everything else is merely a setback.",
        "So, what are the Three Strategies of the Unstoppable Woman? I'm not giving anything away by stating that they are Accountability, Collaboration, and Initiative. It's learning how to apply those strategies that makes this book worth reading. Let Britt Santowski teach you, male or female, how to become unstoppable.",

        "About the Author",
        "Britt Santowski is an author, speaker, consultant, Internet Entrepreneur and full-on adult. That was not always the case. Considered the least likely teenager to succeed by any observant adult, Britt (shall we say) \"lived life to the fullest.\" Hence, she is still one course shy from her grade 12 diploma. It all ends well though. She survived her tumultuous years (adolescence) in Ottawa, and eventually earned her BA in Waterloo, and her MA in St. John's, both degrees in English Lit. Britt concluded her academic years with a (very useful) thesis that focused on gender and cross-dressing in the Renaissance. She still lives in the female form and, having survived numerous recessions, restructurings and entrepreneurial renovations, has a pretty good idea what it takes to be a woman entrepreneur and workplace professional. She lives just outside of Victoria, BC, with her husband and daughter. She writes a seasonal motorcycle column for the local daily, and she also rides a motorcycle. It's yellow. In her book, The Three Strategies of the Unstoppable Woman, Britt shares her journey, her obstacles and her results. Framed in three strategies (accountability, collaboration, and initiative), Britt proposes tools and techniques that women can use to become the author of their own lives. Britt believes that women are incredibly brilliant and when they figure that out, they can shine brighter than the brightest star. Watch out! The Unstoppable Woman is being released..."
