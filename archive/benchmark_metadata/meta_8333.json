        "Born in Pittsburgh in 1945, Robert Munsch actually studied for the priesthood for seven years before attending Boston University and getting a degree in teaching. While training for the priesthood, Robert worked at an orphanage, where he realized that he loved working with kids, so he decided to work in daycare instead. That is where he realized his knack for storytelling: he would tell the kids stories before naptime. His boss convinced him to publish his stories, which allowed Robert to quit his job and become a full-time writer. Today, Robert and his family live in Canada."
