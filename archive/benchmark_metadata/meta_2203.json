        "Review",
        "Amy McClung       This book captivated me from the beginning! The characters are true to life, realistic and strongly written. Rachel, broken by her ex-husband, dealing with lack of confidence due to a failed marriage that she blames herself for. The ex-husband, Mike, is a guy who causes good guys to lose out because he's so terrible that it makes you feel all men are that way. Derek, widower, still loyal to his late wife, fighting prejudices that his father held him to, striving to live his life alone. This is a great story of two heartbroken people finding solace through friendship that becomes more. This isn't just a book of romance though, there are underlying secrets that are revealed. There are a few scenes that are painted so vividly with words that the imagery gave me chill-bumps! There is also a great message of not letting the worlds bigotry get in the way of what your heart feels. The ending is surprising and keeps you wanting more. Looking forward to reading Book 2!Lyle:This was such a good book. From the time I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I absolutely can't wait for the second one to release.Jan:This book had me guessing all the way through. Just when I thought I had the plot figured out I was wrong again. Excited to see where book 2 takes us.Shelly:Great book! After getting to know Rachel and Derek in this book, I can't wait to catch up with them soon it the next one! The twists and turns, the unexpected ending.... Wow, what can I say! Left me wit a ferocious hunger to see what happens next. This author has real imagination.... This book has you reeling as your mind sets you up for one thing and her web spinning skills send you spiraling into a whole other realm!!! Awesome.",

        "I hope you all enjoy reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it! I get the most comments about how this story \"pulls you in\" making the reader feel as if they are living the experience along with my characters was something I strived for in this story and will continue to do in all of my others that will follow. I can honestly say that while I was writing this wonderful book I cried, I laughed, and I made my own self shiver at times!",
