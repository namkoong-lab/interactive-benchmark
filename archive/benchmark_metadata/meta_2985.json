        "From the Author",
        "As a little girl I watched with great anticipation every holiday as my mother made caramels.  They were so yummy that we could hardly stand the anticipation and wait for them to cook and set up.  Her caramels were sought after by all our family and friends and she often gave them away as gifts.  It was these memories that inspired me to write this cookbook!  Our lives are so busy today and it is important that we take just a few minutes every day to relax and clear our minds.  Why not sit down with a good book, a great cup of coffee and a few caramel candies or a bowl of caramel popcorn?  Just writing this and I am feeling the \"call of the caramel\" from my own kitchen!  I hope you enjoy making and sharing the sweet caramel candies and sauces as I did putting the cookbook together for you.  Happy candy making!J. R. Goode",

        "J. R. Goode loves cookbooks and trying new recipes!  She remembers watching her mother can fruits and jams, make homemade bread, stews, soups and more.  Sometimes she can still smell and taste all the wonderful foods she enjoyed as a child!  In addition to just loving food, JR seeks out recipes that are quick and easy to make.  Uncomplicated recipes with maximum \"tasty-ness\" is her motto!"
