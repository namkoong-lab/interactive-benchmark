        "The first book in The War Chapters Series, \"A Hero Rises: Moroni and the Battle for Manti\", introduces readers to Captain Moroni, and how at an early age he came to command a large army in a time of extreme national danger. We follow Moroni though tragedy and triumph, helping all readers to gain a deeper understanding of why Mormon said of him “...if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever...” (Alma 48:17, Book of Mormon)."

        "I just got done reading this book and it took me 3 days to finish it. I enjoyed the book thoroughly. I could see how the author Jason Mow maybe put some of his experiences into the book. I liked how he had all of the relationships between the characters and how they interacted with each other. It was great to read how the author thought some of the events played out and filled in some of the blanks that he thought might have happened. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an action and adventure story. I don't read many books. I am not a book worm type of person. I am glad I added this book to my list of books I have read. I can't wait for the next book to come out. --Trevor StadlerI was totally intrigued by this book and it's portrayal of General Moroni and the other great warriors of the War Chapters.. The heroes in this book are inspirational and exciting to read about. Every person from the age of 8 to 88 will love this book with is powerful resolution of conflict and well described battle scenes. There is something awesome about a hero in today's world that we would love for our children to emulate and learn from. I can't wait to read the next volume as the War Chapters come to life and the Book of Mormon continues to be a marvelous inspiration to us all. Thanks to the author for sharing his vision and insight of these chapters, and what a great story teller! This is a must for all of my children and grandchildren to read and I highly recommend it to everyone. --Anonymous",

Jason served on a joint federal counter narcotics taskforce, worked as a personal body guard for foreign heads of state and high ranking military members, and as a combat team leader deployed to hostile areas in support of America’s interest overseas.
