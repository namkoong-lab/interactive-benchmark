        "In Angelina's Ballet Class by Katharine Holabird, illus. by Catherine Kanner based on illustrations by Helen Craig, the exuberant mouse pairs up with her pal, Alice, to demonstrate first through fifth positions and such steps as a pirouette and a grand jet. Even cousin Henry shows up to play a bee when Angelina and Alice do a Sunflower Ballet. Readers can punch out a flip book of the heroine's moves at the back of the book.",
