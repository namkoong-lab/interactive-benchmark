        "About the Author",
        "Won Park",
        "was born in Korea and moved to the United States when he was three years old. Origami was an important part of his life from a very young age. Won started folding paper when he was 6 years old. His first mentor was his mother, who taught him very simple models. As he got older, he started to study origami from books he borrowed from the library. Won started to fold money when he was in middle school. He found the paper used to make the dollar was the ideal folding medium, since the paper is very resilient and strong. Since then he has specialized in folding money."
