        "J Edward Neill is the author of the rich dark fantasy Tyrants of the Dead series, the co-author of Hollow Empire, a six-part medieval opera, and the creator of the Coffee Table Philosophy series, spanning five books and 444 party-ready philosophy questions. He's also published multiple short stories for Kindles galaxy-wide. Catch up with J via his websites: TesseraGuild.com and DowntheDarkPath.com. A reader of mass quantities of fantasy and sci-fi, J Edward became obsessed with writing fiction in early 2001. On one bitterly cold morning in the lowest corridor of his cubicle, he set fingers to keyboard and began hammering away on what would become a much larger project than he ever imagined. Since that day, he's spent nearly all his free time lost in his daydreams, conjuring ways to write the kind of stories he always loved as a child. He also has a powerful affinity for painting crazy/dark canvasses, quirky foreign films, and his seven-string Ibanez guitar, Beelzebub. J Edward currently lives in the 'burbs of North Georgia, where he moonlights as a foodie, a sipper of too much pinot noir, and the most cantankerous member of his small but beloved family.",
