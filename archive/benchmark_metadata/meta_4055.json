        "Kester Flux-Pen is a unique tool for rework and touch-up soldering. It allows controlled application of flux, eliminating the mess from flux bottles. The chisel point allows for work in very confined spaces. The flux pen is ideally suited for tab assembly no-clean and surface mount rework application because it can deliver flux to a specific area. Kester 951 is a halogen-free, non-rosin organic Flux Pen that is specifically designed for rework of conventional and surface mount circuit board assemblies. The extremely low solids content (2.0%) and nature of the activator system results in practically NO RESIDUE left on the assembly after soldering. There are no residues to interfere with electrical testing. Kester 951 exhibits improved soldering performance to minimize solder bridges (shorts) during rework operations."
