        "How much is an individual the product of his or her upbringing? To what extent is the sense of family, its pride and bonding, a part of an individual’s soul and character? Ann O’Farrell narrates a story of a family’s inexplicable dissolution—five children tragically split and cast off to separate worlds. In the span of fourteen formative years their story unfolds, touching the very core of what is the essence of family and attachment. Set in the rural Ireland of the 1920’s and 30’s, the tale is wonderfully painted in expressive detail, settings and emotion. This is a mindful and moving experience reflective of parents, siblings, and those of us sensitive to today’s family-based challenges and values.An absorbing story … sharply observed characters … a rich portrait of rural Ireland in the '20s and '30s … an engrossing, convincing family saga.Kirkus DiscoveriesA story full of lilting phrases … poignant scenes … tear at the heartstrings. … an explosive finale … that stops readers cold.

        "From the Author",
        "This story has been waiting a long time to be told.",
        "Norah's Children",
        "is a novel which has, at its heart, a truth. There was a Norah, though I'm not sure that she even spelled her name that way. Norah did have five children, and five different families ultimately took in those children. What those families were like, or how those children were actually reared, I do not know. I heard whispers long ago and, like the fine silk of a spider's web, they clung to me. I finally gathered those fragile threads and wove them within a story of \"how it might have been.\"            If there are villains and victims in the story, it is because every story must have its villains and its victims. If there is a hero or a heroine it is because every story should have at least one. The characters, as they are depicted in my story, are conjured from my imagination. No offence or hurt to the memory of any real person is intended.            The original children are all gone. I don't believe they spoke much about their separate lives. In writing this book I wanted to honor them, and the trauma and sadness they must have experienced. Children are our legacy, our joy, and our responsibility. They begin their lives totally trusting in, and dependant on, our integrity. Too often their trust is misplaced.Ann O'Farrell.",
