        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 4–6—The eccentric babysitter with multi-colored hair is back in this sophomore entry in the \"Marge\" series, which was first published in the UK by celebrity author Fisher. In the tradition of Mary Poppins and Nurse Matilda, Marge is a modern reboot of the classic British nanny who brings adventure into the humdrum lives of her charges, all while getting them to accomplish unpleasant tasks by adding a bit of whimsy. This new installment has the same format as the first: three self-contained short stories, although this time, Fisher introduces a new baby to the mix and Marge must now mind Jake and Jemima's baby cousin, which adds a whole other layer to the mayhem. The new adventures include a fun-filled day playing pirates, a trip to the town pool as explorers rescuing stolen treasure, and a wedding in which near-disaster ensues. The slapstick humor is right on target for the intended audience and humorous cartoonlike illustrations of varying sizes can be found on every spread. Jemima's first-person narration puts readers right into the action as Marge creates magic, fun, and resourcefulness wherever she goes while sometimes getting it wrong, which forces the big sister to save the day. No knowledge of the previous book is necessary. Marge may be a bit over the top for some, but she certainly has panache. VERDICT Light and entertaining, buy where the first installment is popular.—Kate Nafz, Fair Lawn Public Library",
