        "Mick and I are enjoying a much-needed date night, all quiet at the Crossroads Hotel, when Emmett Smith, the most powerful mage in the world, arrives to announce his intent to steal our smart-mouthed magic mirror. Next thing we know, my sister is trying to bring down criminals single-handedly, and weird creatures suddenly turn up at Barry’s biker bar.I wake up after I’m knocked out fighting the creatures ... but I seem to be in the past. It’s the time right after Mick, my dragon boyfriend, and I first met, and we’d traveled across country by motorcycle, free and falling in love. The dream seems so real that I begin to forget it isn’t.Dreams keep calling me back, each one more powerful than the last, until past and present run together. Is this some trick of Emmett’s to get his hands on the magic mirror?I must band together with Mick, Cassandra, Nash, Gabrielle, Coyote, Grandmother, Elena, and the dragons—to thwart this greatest of magics before it splits us into fragments and leaves the world vulnerable to the most evil of evils."
