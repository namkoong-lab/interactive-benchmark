        "Powerbronze 400-B101-001 light tint Airflow (double bubble) screen to fit BMW R1100S 98-05. The Airflow (double bubble) windscreen has an aggressive upward sweep that pushes air higher without creating the turbulence normally associated with flip-up type touring screens fitted to sports bikes. These are based on race-proven designs and carry the 'Ride Recommended' tag. All of our Airflow windscreens have TUV type approval."
