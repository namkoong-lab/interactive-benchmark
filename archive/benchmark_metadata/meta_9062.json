        "The guard is the quintessential Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighting position. Other martial arts assume that once someone is on their back that the fight is over. But that assumption is unfounded. Fights don't end just because they hit the ground; for the jiu-jitsu man the fight has only just begun. The Guard is a detailed analysis of core concepts, details, and techniques, key to success for ground fighting from the guard position."
