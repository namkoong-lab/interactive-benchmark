        "Offering goofy, boldly colored cartoons, Lodge delights in the general grossness (the monster's drink of choice is \"stinky, wormy cabbage juice with added chunks of slug\"). Her readers will, too.—Publishers WeeklyThe short, snappy text and the size and boldness of the pop-ups make this a surefire choice for group sharing, but novice and reluctant readers will also enjoy tackling this on their own. This has obvious and wide appeal, and the kids who gravitate towards Shel Silverstein’s grosser poetic offerings will be particularly pleased by Icky’s actions.—Bulletin of the Center for Children's BooksChildren almost certainly will be intrigued by the horned blue monster, even as they sometimes shriek with disgust.—New York Times onlines",
