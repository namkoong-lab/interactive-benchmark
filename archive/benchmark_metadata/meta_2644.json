        "From the Author",
        "Written for ease of reading by all (especially senior citizens) because Dr. Hugate states that the theme of the handbook is to help people make tough decisions and also help loved ones and caregivers understand the issues, alternatives, and choices. The information as presented is tailored to those who most need it, tailored to the best possible outcome by strongly urging physical therapy as essentially mandatory, tailored to finding the best surgeon possible, tailored to help people prepare their homes, and especially tailored to help them know when and if the time has come for a joint replacement and what to do next. For people who have never been through total joint replacement, and perhaps even major surgery, the handbook covers these topics in perfectly focused detail.The science, procedures, and even materials of total joint replacement are under constant improvement and change as time reveals best practices. Written on purpose to avoid medical jargon, to include highly technical, date-dependent procedures and approaches, would have rendered the handbook obsolete in short order. Now in print for four years and nearing 3,000 copies sold, the handbook's quality speaks for itself.There are even cartoons because the subject matter is quite heavy and both coauthors felt that including some humor would help lighten up a very serious subject.We wish you the very best possible outcome should you choose to go embark on th life-changing journey through total joint replacement.",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "Dr. Hugate is Chairman of Orthopedics at Presbyterian St. Luke'sHospital in Denver Colorado.He has authored numerous scientific articlesand has also served in the in the U.S. Army Reserves, serving in both Afghanistan and Iraq. His depth of knowledge, surgical expertise, and empathy in relating to his patients makes him an unmatchable resource for patients in their journey through joint replacement. This handbook is a must-have for anyone considering hip or knee joint replacement surgery! It cuts through the fog of medical jargon and give you the wisdom and information needed in clear, understandable terms. The journey is described from beginning to end through the use of multiple perspectives: surgeon, patient, and medical team.This unique approach truly brings the subject matter to life and empower you in making the right decisions.\"Carol says: It was easy to read and understand. The humor is refreshing and since those reading the book are making a tough, health decision, it helps to keep life in perspective. It also reminds us to choose life, to move on and not be stuck in the pain zone. This book does not invite a mind set of negativity and I believe it will help those who read it be prepared for a successful surgery and recovery.\"",
