        "Life has shifted for J. P. Beaumont. After a tragic accident that devastated—and ultimately disbanded—his Special Homicide Investigation Team, he accepts that he has left homicide detection behind at this point, but he has a lot of unanticipated free time on his hands. He's keeping busy with renovations on the new house that he and his wife, Mel Soames, the newly appointed chief of police in Bellingham, Washington, have bought. But new fixtures and paint palettes can occupy only so much of Beau's daily life, and Mel is encouraging him to return to where he is needed: investigating crimes.",
        "In the meantime, she is struggling to gain control of her new situation, cast into a department where some are welcoming—and some are not. It's been a few months, and the tension in the police department is rising, but Beau realizes Mel has to tackle things in her own way, so he refrains from advising. But when Beau shows up one afternoon to survey the construction at their new house and finds Mel's car there but no sign of her, his investigative instincts kick in. Suddenly he's back in the game—except this time, his heart is on the line as well as his professional dignity."

        "bestselling author of the Ali Reynolds series, the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, and a number of novels featuring the Walker family. Before becoming an author, Jance worked as a librarian and a teacher on a Native American reservation. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance and her husband live in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.",
        "Review",
        "As former homicide investigator J. P. Beaumont and his wife, Mel Soames, both begin new facets of their law enforcement careers, Jance provides plenty of character development and suspense. Narrator J. R. Horne tells the story rather than trying to dramatize the voices, offering realistic tones and pacing and heightening suspense and drama. His clear narration makes following the action easy and builds listener concern when Mel goes missing. For Mel, the politics of becoming police chief will always involve Beaumont, her biggest supporter. Getting to know him better through this production will encourage listeners to seek more J. P. Beaumont stories.",
