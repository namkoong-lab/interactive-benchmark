        "These super bright, decorative string lights by RTGS Products are perfect for a variety of uses. Whether you want to put up Christmas lights indoors or decorate your outdoor patio, these battery-powered fairy lights look beautiful. Make any space light up like the starry night sky. Whatever the occasion—birthdays, weddings, dinner parties, girls’ night in, holidays—these lights create an amazing atmosphere. The string includes 60 cold white colored LED lights spaced 4in apart on a silver wire that measures about 21ft long. They are much thinner than traditional rope lights and easily bend around patios, gardens, furniture, vases, centerpieces, mason jars, curtains, costumes, etc. Powered by 6 AA batteries (not included), these lights use a fraction of the energy needed by other light strings. The waterproof battery pack features a button to select between three different modes. Press the button once to select the “Timer” mode. The “Timer” mode means that the lights remain lit for six hours, then turn off for 18 hours. The lights turn on and off at exactly the same time every day according to when you activated the timer. Full batteries will last over 14 days in the “Timer” mode. Press the button twice to select the constant “On” mode. In this mode, the lights remain constantly lit for over 48 hours with full batteries. Press the button three times to select the constant “Off” mode. In this mode, the lights remain off until a different mode is selected. These RTGS light strings will last 20 years. We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a two-year warranty on this product. RTGS Products is the exclusive designer, manufacturer, and seller of RTGS string lights. Only RTGS lights purchased directly from us are guaranteed to be the highest-quality, brightest, and longest-lasting lights."
