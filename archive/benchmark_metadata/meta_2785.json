        "We all wake up on the wrong side of the bed sometimes! But even if we wake up in a grumpy mood, we can always turn our day around. In this cute, colorful picture book, children are introduced to the imaginary \"bumblies\" and \"grumblies\" that can make you wake up in a good or bad mood. Through fun rhymes and illustrations, they're then shown what they can do to help improve their mood and make it a good day after all! Perfect for teaching kids how to take responsibility for themselves and their feelings. If your toddler, preschooler, or older child often wakes up grumpy, this is the book for you."

        "Beau has been reading children's books since he was just a child (obviously). But he started writing them only recently, so he could share them with his own two small children. He loves writing rhyming books for kids of all ages, and stories of adventure and bravery like he enjoyed when he was young. Actually who is he kidding, he still loves those stories! Beau is just getting started with his writing, but he is loving every minute of it so far. There's plenty more to come!",
