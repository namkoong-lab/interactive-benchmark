        "About the Author",
        "Here is a highly personalized book, written as an exercise in what can be done using one thrifted wool blanket, a pair of scissors and a needle and thread. Written mostly for fun, the 40+ projects are sweet and simple, with some seasonal projects, that address all skill levels from child novice to expert. The book concept, design, illustrations, crafts, text, and photographs are all the work of the author and personify this book, as not only charming, but truly \"homemade\"."
