        "Review",
        "A seductive invitation to the cruising life-style, in the main because these veteran voyagers have a unique way of reducing the issues and making the break seem almost easy. The Cost Conscious Cruiser is a powerful argument for simplicity and common sense. In 30 years of cruising, their precept really hasn't changed from the first - Go simple, go small, go now. It's appealing because it makes the wild things possible. -- --",
        "Dan Spurr, Editor, Practical Sailor",
        "<br /><br />Cruisers who are handy, and willing to take off without frills should read this book.

This book takes an offbeat look at how to strip down your thinking as well as your boat. --Denny Desoutter, founding editor, Practical Boat OwnerLin and Larry have been containing cruising costs for the last 40 years. They question the necessity of much of what cruisers today call 'standard equipment'. Herein they share hundreds of their secrets. --Patience Wales, editor emeritus, Sail Magazine",
