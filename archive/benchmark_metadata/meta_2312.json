        "The Baptist Health Care Journey to Excellence presents tested principles and best practices to help improve your corporate culture and customer satisfaction, which will lead to loyalty, stability, sustained productivity, and profitability in your own organization.",
        "For three consecutive years, Baptist Health Care has been ranked as one of Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work for in America. All five of Baptist Health Care's hospitals have spent multiple years in the top one percent in patient satisfaction based on survey results from the largest hospital patient database in the world. In 2004, President George W. Bush awarded the company the coveted Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. But Baptist Health Care was not always a success story.",
        "In 1995, Al Stubblefield and his management team had to face some harsh realities: patient satisfaction rating had reached an all-time low; recent corporate reengineering efforts had damaged employee morale; and five years of merger discussions with three different organizations further devastated morale. Al's suspicions were confirmed when an attitude survey conducted among his employees made it abundantly clear: they were not pleased with the Baptist Health Care experience. In addition to the internal conflicts, their flagship hospital was competing against two other facilities owned by national health care conglomerates with bigger budgets and deeper pockets. Outspending them was simply not possible.",
        "This is the story about how one company beat the odds and rebounded to become a leader in its field and a pioneer in management. By creating a cultural transformation within their Baptist Health Care organization, employees became engaged and inspired to perform at the highest levels. Their positive outlook translated into a level of service and operational excellence that has become the national benchmark. Through their story, you too will learn how to transform your organization into a WOW! culture with a passion for excellence.",
