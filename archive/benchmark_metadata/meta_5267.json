        "Touch-up paint designed specifically by ColorRite for the 2013 Harley-Davidson FLHX Street Glide. ColorRite is the leader in touch-up paint for your motorcycle, personal watercraft, snowmobile, ATV, or outboard engine. Recommended by thousands of motorcycle dealers and enthusiasts since 1988, our paints are the absolute, highest quality O.E.M.-matched paint available. We guarantee our paint will match your original factory color or we will send you a new order. It is not possible to correctly match to faded or damaged paint so this is not included in our guarantee. Performing a \"spray-out\" (a test application of the color on something other than your intended part) is critical to ensure that the color matches and you're applying coats as the paint requires. As a general guideline, our half-pints are intended for smaller items such as a fairing or saddlebag. A pint will cover multiple items, such as a tank and saddlebags, or a full fairing. Our largest size (quart) will paint an entire motorcycle. ColorRite is committed to your achieving results, staffing a dedicated team of specialists to support you. We ship from both California and Pennsylvania to deliver your paint as quickly as possible. ColorRite - delivering quality for over 25 years."
