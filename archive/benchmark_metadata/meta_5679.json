        "Pentius UltraFLOW spin-on oil filters are designed to meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications. The Pentius UltraFLOW \"Red\" premium filters incorporate advanced filtration technology and deliver superior filtration characteristics. These filters are individually packaged in distinctive Pentius red and white boxes, and are manufactured in strict accordance with the ISO9001 quality management system. Pentius uses a heavier gauge steel filter shell, as well as a heavy duty nitrile rubber anti-drain back valve, high quality filtration media, and metal end plates instead of cardboard end plates, thereby providing enhanced filter durability, as well as maximum engine protection and fuel efficiency. Pentius UltraFLOW filters effectively block out the full range of oil contaminants to ensure that the engine is protected from abrasive elements, ensuring proper lubrication for peak engine performance. Pentius filters are warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship, and are fully compatible with conventional oil as well as with synthetic, and synthetic blend oils. New vehicle manufacturer warranties remain in full effect when Pentius UltraFLOW filters are installed properly, and based on manufacturer recommended service intervals."
