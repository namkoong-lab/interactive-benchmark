        "Twelve stories of the supernatural by Dennis Hamley collected into one edition. The world of ghosts is a varied one. The ghosts in these stories may seek justice for wrongs done to them in life, they may bring relief for injustice to people in the present. Some are malignant, some bring hope to the people of the present, some bring danger, others bring death. They may repay debts, they may right wrongs. There are prizefighting ghosts, musical ghosts, athletic ghosts, football ghosts, railway ghosts, Christmas ghosts, revenants from the past and one or two from the future. Ghost stories have been told for as long as there has been speech. They seem to satisfy deeply held instincts and needs. Each of these stories comes with an author's postscript, showing what triggered the writing process, what sort of ghost inhabits the story ands where it may sit in the great pantheon of this mighty genre."
