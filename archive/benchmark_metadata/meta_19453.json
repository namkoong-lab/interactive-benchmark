        "What can Matt, an 11-year-old boy, do when his father is too obsessed with work to spend quality time with his family? A forgotten school project turns into sudden inspiration for Matt--if he buys his father's company, Tyler's Toys, he'll become his father's boss and can force him to spend more time at home! With a little business guidance from his teacher, some help from his friend Danny, and the promise of a major computer chip breakthrough by his sister Kelly, Matt secures $4 million from online kid investors and pulls off a hostile takeover of Tyler Toys. The fun really begins when Matt appears in front of his employees as an animated face on a computer monitor and institutes a liberal new work policy. Matt quickly discovers just how much work running a business entails and finds himself in serious trouble with the local bank and the Federal Trade Commission. Can a lot of hard work by the entire family and a little luck save Tyler's Toys? This well-produced, 99-minute video features Kevin Kilner, Alexandra Paul, Rich Little, and Dom DeLuise. The story is engaging, if strikingly reminiscent of the Tom Hanks movie",
