        "This book tells the story of the year 1969 in the extraordinary cycling career of Eddy Merckx, one the most successful riders in the history of competitive cycling. This year is engraved in the memory of every Belgian cycling fan as the year in which Merckx won his first Tour de France, the first time in 30 years that a Belgian had won this prestigious race. In 1969, however, he won much more: his first Tour of Flanders; Liège-Bastogne-Liège (also known as La Doyenne, or 'The Old Lady'); and his third Milan-San Remo cycling classic. This book chronicles his career in interviews with Merckx himself, his family, friends, and rivals, and includes dozens of previously unpublished photos."
