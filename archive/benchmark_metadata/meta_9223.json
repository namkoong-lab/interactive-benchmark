        "Three little gophers, out on a hike, have lost their way. They find a house in the woods, but no one is home. Timidly, they open the door and go inside, where it is warm and cozy. The gophers can't resist climbing into the bed to rest. Before too long, they are joined by two bunny rabbits and three raccoons who have also lost their way. Just as they are all settled down for the night in the nice, big bed, the door opens once more -- and",

        "Carefully applied colored pencil suggests the fog that causes three gophers to lose their way in the woods, and--like Goldilocks--enter an empty but comfortable house. More timid than their fairy-tale counterpart, the gophers are hesitant, but they are so tired, they finally tuck themselves into the large bed. Their sleep is not sound, however, because they are soon joined by two bunnies and three raccoons also seeking shelter. The various saws hanging on the wall make the animals a bit apprehensive: Have they stumbled upon the house of a witch? And hearts beat faster when a huge figure enters and looms over the quaking critters. Fortunately, though, Mr. Bear is a welcoming host, who serves his guests hot stew, then climbs into bed with them to sleep until the fog-free morning. The pictures hint at the identity of the home owner; the Japanese printing on pot labels and book titles reveals the story's origin. The cozy interiors, appealingly drawn animals, and familiar themes transcend cultural borders.",

        "A comforting bedtime tale is this reissue of a picture book first published in 1982 (only its jacket has been revised). With low-key color-penciled illustrations in soft pastel shades, artist Yasuko Koide perfectly complements his wife Tan's spare and mildly suspenseful tale about three gophers, two bunny rabbits, and a trio of raccoons who take shelter in a mysteriously unoccupied house when they lose their way in the fog as night falls. When \"something huge and dark\" walks in on them, all snuggled comfortably in a big four-poster bed, listeners/viewers will fear the worst. But the bear in this tale, unlike the ursine threesome in",
