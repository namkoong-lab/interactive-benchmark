        "is now available. Read for free with Kindle Unlimited! Lord Heath Knight is the quintessential wastrel second son. He has spent his youth raking and making merry to be as opposite of his brother as possible. When he finds himself almost dead, his dictatorial older brother has had enough and issues an edict for him to marry or be cut off. Heath decides to marry the most unsuitable lady he can in order to vex his brother the duke. Cecilia Dudley is an heiress with a catch—her father is a cit. Her dowry is so vulgar that she has decided she would rather avoid marriage in favor of an independent life where she can live as she likes. When she suddenly finds herself married, she quickly realizes a marriage of convenience is not so convenient.",
        "Heath quickly realizes he cannot ignore his new wife. Cecilia cannot accept his wild past and the baggage that follows him. Will Cecilia be able to resist the charms of a seasoned rogue?",

It was Jane Austen\\'s clever wit and unique turn of phrase that hooked Johns when she was \"forced\" to read Pride and Prejudice for a school assignment. She began writing when she ran out of her favorite author\\'s books and decided to try her hand at crafting a Regency romance novel. Her journey into publishing began with the release of Surrender the Past, book one of the Loring-Abbott Series. Johns makes no pretensions to Austen\\'s wit but hopes readers will perhaps laugh and find some enjoyment in her writing.', 'Johns attributes much of her inspiration to her mother, a retired English teacher. During their last summer together, Johns would sit on the porch swing and read her stories to her mother, who encouraged her to continue writing. Busy with multiple careers, including a professional job in the medical field, author and mother, Johns squeezes in time for reading whenever possible.', 'Follow Elizabeth online at www.facebook.com/Elizabethjohnsauthor', 'or www.Elizabethjohnsauthor.com']}"
