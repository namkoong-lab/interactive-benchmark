        "Mark served for nine years total on active duty and eleven as a Reserve SEAL,",
        "retiring as Commander",
        "in 2011. His leadership of teams was so effective the government tasked him with creating",
        "a nationwide mentoring program",
        "for SEAL trainees. Not only did it increase the quality of SEAL candidates, it",
        "reduced BUD/S attrition rate",
        "up to five percent.",
        "What made Mark's program so effective was his focus on",
        "more than just physical fitness",
        ". He'd seen laughter conquer fatigue and bond teams at their BUD/S breaking point, intuition save his men during the hell of war and special ops missions. He knew he could form a fitness company that prepared civilians for the",

        "of Navy SEAL-like lifestyle. So he started SEALFIT.",
        "Entrepreneur, Professor and Unbeatable Mind",
        "At the same time SEALFIT was beginning he co-founded Coronado Brewing Company, built www.NavySEALs.com, the leading website for SEAL gear and information, and launched US Tactical, a government contracting business. He also",
        "served as adjunct professor of leadership",
        "at the University of San Diego before the Navy called him up for duty in the Iraq War.",
        "Through Mark's teaching, entrepreneurial endeavors and travel to foreign countries, he noticed the",
        "power",
        "of mental toughness, emotional resilience, intuitive leadership and a healthy spirit",
        "for",
        "anyone wanting breakthrough performance",
        ". They weren't solely for combat or restricted to the business world or one culture. He'd watch them transform lives in people from every background, nation and belief system. So he wrote and self-published his first book, Unbeatable Mind, in 2011 and launched its at-home online study program at www.unbeatablemind.com.",
