        "Why do so many actively managed funds underperform? Why do passively managed funds provide superior returns, especially after taxes? What are the true interests of fund managers and the financial press? Most important, what strategy is in your best interest?",
        "What Wall Street Doesn't Want You to Know",
        "answers all these questions and more, giving you the inside information you need to become a successful investor who plays the winner's game--creating wealth--instead of the loser's game Wall Street wants you to play, of trying to pick stocks and time the market.

He dispenses with traditional Wall Street wisdom and experts and shows you how to invest the way really smart money invests today.",

        "Review",
        "“This wonderfully iconoclastic book drums home the message that beating the stock market is a loser's game. Larry Swedroe's new book tilts-successfully-at the windmills of professional managers, Wall Street analysts, owing 'the best 100 companies' (or the best ten funds), hedge funds market timers, investment newsletters, and short-term strategies. Once you're convinced by the powerful case the author has made, he then offers seven steps to playing a winner's game. The diagnosis is right on the mark, and his essential prescription-rely on portfolio construction, index funds, broad diversification, minimal costs and taxes, risk control, and time-also comes close to the center of the target: the optimal accumulation of your financial wealth.” ―John C. Bogle, founder and former chairman of The Vanguard Group",
