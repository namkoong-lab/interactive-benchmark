Jan is fascinated with the courage, adaptability and resilience that people rise to in times of adversity and for which they do not expect pay, praise or commendation. Jan is also interested in writing about the similarities as opposed to the differences amongst people and the ways in which experiences and emotions bind humans together. Jan was born in London but spent her childhood in Southern California. She was a teacher of English and Drama for many years and is now a Learning Supervisor at a college of further education. When she is not working or writing, Jan enjoys yoga, swimming, cooking, walking, reading and spending time with her grandchildren.

As well as learning so much about the courage, adaptability, and resilience displayed by women and men during the war, I have also come to understand that the experiences people had during that time in terms of the human condition are still being experienced now in other times and places. The details may differ but human beings, and the ways in which they react, don’t change. It's a wonderful opportunity to explore universal emotions, ambitions, love, loss, parenting and a whole list of other life events. My novels explore the many ways in which ordinary people are affected by extraordinary events and how they cope during times of adversity. I'm also interested in highlighting the similarities, as opposed to the differences, between people and the way that shared experiences and emotions bind them together.\", 'I was born in London but spent my childhood in Southern California where a love of books and literature was instilled in me by bookworm parents and regular trips to the library.
