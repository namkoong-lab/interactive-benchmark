        "“As a boy, I had the Huck Finn dream that many do of letting the river carry me to adventure.” Now, some 30 years later, award-winning outdoor writer Michael Tougias lives that dream. Trading Huck Finn’s log raft for canoe and kayak, Tougias journeys the length of the Connecticut River—from its source near the Canadian border through four New England states to where it meets the sea in Connecticut. Recently designated an American Heritage River, the Connecticut provides the perfect setting for Tougias’s narrative—a wonderful blend of adventure, fishing tales, history, and literature."
