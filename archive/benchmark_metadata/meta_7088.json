        "Review",
        "`Review from previous edition The Oxford Dictionary of Rhymes contains a vast variety of useful short cuts and fascinating sidetracks. All wordsmiths are bound to enjoy feeling indebted (fetid, minareted, rosetted . . . )' Julia Donaldson (author of The Gruffalo)`The Oxford Dictionary of Rhymes is a success and a pleasure. The rhyming system mirrors genuine cognition, the way poets work, and using it reveals marvels and carnivals within our language. It is by far the best dictionary of its type because it can be drawn on during the conscious design of a poem, yet it can help you with work which is more intuitive, tentative or open-ended. Dylan Thomas would have adored it; Byron would have respected it.'' David Morley, poet, Director of the Warwick Writing Programme, University of Warwick."
