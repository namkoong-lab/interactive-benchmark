        "With Blood Prize, Ken Grace has crafted a masterful, high-stakes story of absolute imagination. Thrilling action, gripping suspense and a devastating secret, ensure a breath-taking adventure that is impossible to put down.CAN TOM UNLOCK THE SECRETS FROM THE PAST, TO SAVE THE FUTURE?It’s 5am and Tom Fox is running, trying to save his life, but he can’t escape the images that revisit his mind; vivid pictures of a woman with her throat torn open and the mutilation of a young man in a back alley of London.  Tom is on everyone’s most wanted list, yet he’s no felon. He flees, hunted like his father for what he knows. If Tom is to survive, he must locate an alien technology called the Prize, before it falls into the hands of the despots who are chasing him ... and leaves the world irretrievably altered.Author’s Warning:I have to caution you. If you open Blood Prize and begin to read, you will be in great danger and you won’t be able to turn back. Once it begins, your heart will start to race and your chest will tighten. Every rustle and alien noise will raise your anxiety. How could you ever relax knowing she’s out there?I can understand your skepticism. They’re just characters in a story you say. How could they possibly hurt me? Why? Because my dark ideas have come to fruition. Once the story of the Blood Prize is in your head, the characters are just as real as anything in your experience. You’ll feel what Tom feels … The fear, the hopelessness and eventually the power to fight back.Now that you’ve begun, I can only hope you’re brave enough to see the journey through to its conclusion. You’ve gained incredible new-found powers along the way, but can you handle it? You’ve become something unrecognisable … something not of this world.I can only hope that you win the Prize and save us all."

        "About the Author",
        "Ken began writing part-time in 2005 and succeeded to full-time writing in 2013. He published his first novel 'Blood Prize' featuring Tom Fox and the sinister Cel Rau half twins, Uta and Rez, in 2014. Ken is currently at work on two new books: The Leviathan and Balaam's Deceit, both featuring many of the original 'Blood Prize' characters. Ken was born in Australia and grew up in the Murray River town of Howlong, where he completed his early schooling. The diverse complexity of his environment proved to be a young man's adventure paradise and is where he developed a lifelong love of the natural world. He spent much of these years exploring the wild streams and rivers of the area, from snow-capped mountains to semi-desert plains, providing a rich diet of experience for a hungry imagination. Ken's love of a good story may have originated from Harry Osborne, his beloved late Grandfather, who could exaggerate an uneventful walk beside the river into 'The Old Man and the Sea'. Ken lives and works with his wife Katie in the small country town of Freeburgh in North East Victoria.",
