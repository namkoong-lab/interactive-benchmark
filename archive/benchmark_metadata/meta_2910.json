        "Two young outsiders - Bron, a jaded musician unworldly and luckless, and Dan, a semi-reformed criminal secretive and haunted - are brought together by a chance encounter and drawn by kinship of character, desperation and music into each other’s worlds. Between them on Dan’s council estate comes the beautiful but troubled Cal, to Bron a songbird and daydream but to Dan a byword for all that he knows comes with her. On their horizon gleams the mirage of being something and someone, but ever closer behind is Dan’s past, inventive in its nemeses and indiscriminate in its prey.‘An accomplished novel replete with deft writing, memorable characters, sharp dialogue, humour, wisdom and evocative observation... Original, rewarding and moving.’Matthew Branton (novelist), TLC.",

        "Tina Stanciu, Readers' Favorite.Thieves in the Night by author Brendan Ball is a poetic portrayal of London's lightless life, a wild ride between different times and labyrinthine emotions, but most of all it's a vivid reading experience from the first page to the last. Dan and Bron develop a relationship based on their mutual love for music and their need for companionship; but this is not your everyday friendship - it will soon turn into a pirouette of mixed feelings, love triangles and haunting pasts. Dan's criminal tendencies, Bron's attraction to this cryptic world, and the presence of Cal, one of Dan's past acquaintances, tied together with the dark side of human emotions, the never-ending spins of violence and drugs, and the magnificent writing style of Brendan Ball will have every reader wanting more. The poetic construction of the story, alongside humorous notes and time dances, dazzle and amaze the reader, helping the author create a mysterious world of darkness and deceit, a world none of us can resist. Although it jumps from present to past and back again, your reading experience will not suffer, especially if you give in to the story and simply follow its course. Brendan Ball's Thieves in the Night surprised me with characters that grow with each page, landscapes, events and emotions described with a beauty of words that few authors can master, and with an understanding of the human mind and its desires that went far beyond our daily needs of companionship. Thieves in the Night is a book for everyone, as long as you can accept the voyage and let your mind be mystified by the time traveling writing style, the complexity of characters and the momentousness of emotions.",
