        "is cousin Gregory going to be born? asks little Iris. Each family member has a different answer to her question. While she's waiting for what seems like forever, Iris thinks about all the exciting things she and her new cousin will someday do together. And given Iris' vibrant imagination, there's no telling what to expect. National Book Award winner Kimberly Willis Holt offers a unique take on some of the traditional and not-so-traditional myths surrounding a baby's arrival, with an extra layer of imagination added by Gabi Swiatkowska's fresh and whimsical paintings."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Grade 1-4–Its no surprise that the exquisitely rendered child attired in 18th-century clothing on the title page, her mouth open, eyes alight, is an inquisitive little girl. Iris is anxiously awaiting a cousins birth, but when she asks when it will happen, she receives some outlandish answers. Grandpa says the baby will come When the giant stork flies across the sky and drops him over your aunts house. Grandma says he will grow under a cabbage. Mr. Conner says he will come after the nine months it takes to build a ladder to the clouds and get him. Only Momma gives the little girl a bead on the truth. But it still takes a long time, and when Gregory does arrive, Iris must continue to wait to build a snowman with him. Swiatkowskas familiar swirls of paint are evident in the pictures inspired by French artists and circus themes. The myths Iris hears about Gregorys birth appear throughout in surreal paintings and drawings–a stork moves along on a pulley to make its delivery; clocks mark the passage of time; animals, charts, and weird-looking inventions abound. There is more to discover with each viewing. Waiting for an infant to be born is not a new theme in picture books, but the mixed-media illustrations here make this rendition unique.",

        "PreS-Gr. 2. Far from the usual angry, jealous scenarios of sibling rivalry and displacement, this dreamy picture book shows a child's romance and wonder about her unborn cousin. Iris can't wait for Gregory to be born, and she asks everyone when he will arrive. The answers she gets range from vague (\"not too soon . . . not too long,\") to mythic (\"When the giant stork flies across the sky\") to totally silly (her friend says Iris' aunt must eat \"a thousand chocolate-chip ice-cream sundaes with sour pickles on top\" to get a big belly). The surreal mixed-media pictures, which blend many styles, show Iris imagining a variety of scenes: a medieval-type mechanical contraption, an angel in the snow, a baby growing under the soil like a cabbage. Then comes the climax as Iris holds a gorgeous, smiling baby. The mix of the everyday and the magical from the child's viewpoint captures the longing, mystery, and joy.",
