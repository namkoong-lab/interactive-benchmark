        "Loosely adapted from the popular Japanese drama, Heaven's Coins, Spring Days tells the story of Suh Jung-Eun (Ko Hyun-Jung), an elusive beauty who has suffered a trauma so great that she loses the will to speak. Go Eun-Ho (Ji Jin-Hee) is the doctor who helps Jung-Eun find a way to overcome her past. But just when her gratitude starts to blossom into love, fate cruelly intervenes, leaving Eun-Ho in a coma, caused by a car accident when driving with his long lost mother who died at the scene. At the hospital Jung-Eun meets Eun-Ho's stepbrother Eun-Sup (Zo In Sung), who is also a doctor. Despite his best intentions, Eun-Sup finds himself powerless to resist Jung-Eun during Eun-Ho's coma stage. Later Eun-ho does regain consciousness, but as a man living in his childhood state of memory. In his mind he starts to gain back little by little of his memory. One day as he intercepts a car, he starts to recall the past and understand the unacknowledged pain and fear of cars resulting from his mother's death......"
