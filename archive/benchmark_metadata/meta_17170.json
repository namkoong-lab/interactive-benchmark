        "XPERIA 1 IV Speed is everything With Xperia’s signature speed at its core, the Xperia 1 IV has a triple lens camera that can record 4K HDR 120fps on all lenses. It can capture photos at 20fps burst with AE/AF in HDR and boasts a new true optical zoom 85-125mm. And it lets you share your experiences on the go with video and game live streaming. The Xperia 1 IV delivers the best of Sony to every user and creator. There are standout features for videographers and photographers, and major wins for mobile gamers, whether they’re eSports players or streamers. Audiophiles benefit from decades of Sony sound and music expertise, along with new Music Pro for studio-style song recording. And cinephiles will appreciate the brightest smartphone 4K HDR 120Hz display ever. Three lenses for video content creation The Xperia 1 IV gives videographers a wealth of creative opportunities with a choice of three lenses including ultra-wide 16mm, wide-angle 24mm, and telephoto with true optical zoom 85-125mm. All three offer 4K HDR 120fps video recording, Eye AF and Object tracking. Professional technology from Alpha cameras The Xperia 1 IV was co-developed with the engineers behind the latest Alpha 1 series cameras, renowned for their industry-leading autofocus technology, and with input from professional photographers, who helped tune the technology and refine the photographic experience and results. And just as Alpha photographers expect the same performance in any lens, so the Xperia 1 IV offers the same AF capabilities across all its lenses."
