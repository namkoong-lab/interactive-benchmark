        "It is said that each day of the zodiac calendar has a special story to tell, which is hidden in the stars. Those born under the sign of Libra, September 23rd to October 23rd, are peaceful and believe in both fairness and equality. Libra’s are also very social, and they hate being alone. This has inspired artisan Joe to create this stunning dog tag pendant featuring the symbol for Libra. He uses fine .925 sterling silver to craft this piece and then accents it with sparkling cubic zirconia gemstones. All set on a sterling silver cable chain, this stunning necklace is sure to look amazing with any outfit. PLEASE NOTE: The handcrafted nature of this product will produce minor differences in design, sizing and weight. Variations will occur from piece to piece, measurements may vary slightly.",
