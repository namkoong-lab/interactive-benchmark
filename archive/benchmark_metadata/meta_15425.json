        "The Casio Men's Referee Timer World Time Watch features a clean face and intuitive design that makes it perfect for athletes, pee-wee coaches, and even professional referees. Constructed with a stainless steel case, the watch includes a stationary stainless steel bezel, and a stainless steel link band with an adjustable buckle clasp for a unique fit. A durable mineral window shields the digital-gray dial face, which prominently displays the time, along with the day, date, and month. The watch also includes four easy-to-use mode, adjust, light, and reset function buttons along the bezel, as well as a large start/stop button at the six o'clock position. This digital-quartz-powered timepiece is water resistant to 330 feet and comes with a one-year limited manufacturer's warranty.",

        "With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.",
        "Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward."
