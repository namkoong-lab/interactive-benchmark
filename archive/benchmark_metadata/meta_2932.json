        "From her carefree early life on a farm in rural South Australia to a marriage that was broken even before it began, then living as a struggling single mother and navigating a string of bad romances – this is the story of a woman whose lessons in life – and love – have been learned the hard way.Jules Hannaford grew up living an idyllic childhood, full of fun and adventures. She went to boarding school and had the time of her life, excelling at sport, making new friends and getting in trouble due to her risk taking and mischievous nature.When single motherhood called for her to step up and take charge, she found her passion in her career as a teacher, yet she struggled to find someone to share her life with. One day, the opportunity came for her to move across the world. She packed her bags, pulled her daughter out of school, and took the risk of leaving her sleepy home city for Asia’s mega city of Hong Kong.From then on, life was different. Suddenly, she was in a job she loved, and she no longer had to struggle to make ends meet, but there was still one thing missing. Love.Optimistic, Jules began internet dating, and unwittingly invited a new kind of trouble into her life. Was it her trusting nature? Her naïveté? Or was it simply her desperate desire to share her life with someone that made her take the risks that almost cost her life?‘Far from being a shameful one, Jules’s story is proof that this type of abusive behaviour can happen to anyone and how manipulative coercive control can be. Her bravery in speaking out sends the clear message to watch not what they say but what they do when dating. The warning signs are there, you just need to heed them.’-Viv McGrathAuthor of ‘Unbeatable: How I Left a violent man’ and domestic violence survivor.

        "ules grew up in rural South Australia before moving to Adelaide, the state capital, and beginning her career as a teacher. She now lives in Hong Kong, the setting of her first book, Fool Me Twice, which details the pitfalls and abuse she experienced in her online search for love.Jules began writing her book in 2010, when she was involved in an internet dating scam. She decided this was an important story to share with other women to prevent them from becoming caught in the same trap and help them make safer, smarter decisions when dating online. It took a long time for her to muster the courage to share her story after battling the shame of choices that landed her in a dangerous situation she counts herself lucky to have survived.Jules has always had a passion for people and their stories, so she started her podcast 'Hong Kong Confidential' in 2017 to provide a platform for sharing the stories of interesting and unique people in Hong Kong. Just as she knows the importance of sharing their stories on her podcast, she feels that her story can make an important contribution to the safety of those navigating the complicated--and sometimes illusionary--internet dating world.",
