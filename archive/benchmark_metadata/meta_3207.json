        "This aromatic composition made with olive oil, fresh garlic and fresh thyme stands out by way of its original flavor. The perfume of garlic predominates at first and the thyme's freshness comes through in the aftertaste. Remarkable by virtue of its ability to round a dish nicely, our Garlic & Thyme oil can be used in a large number of preparations, ranging from green salad (preferably romaine) to leg of lamb, and including grilled dishes."
