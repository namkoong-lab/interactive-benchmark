        "Continuing with Rural Rhythm s highly successful Power Picks collection series comes 33 Pickin Bluegrass Power Picks Instrumentals, containing 33 authentic performances and beloved timeless classics by many Bluegrass legends and pioneers. The recent upsurge of interest in Bluegrass has reconnected America with its past. Rural Rhythm was foremost among the labels that recorded Bluegrass. From its inception in 1955, Rural Rhythm s founder, Uncle Jim O Neal, loved traditional music and probably knew as many songs from early times as any folklorist. He would encourage his artists to keep these songs alive, and, as a result, Rural Rhythm is a treasure trove of traditional American music. The old songs tell us so much about the way our ancestors lived and about the way the country has changed since the first settlers arrived. This new Power Picks collection contains the real thing , recorded by Bluegrass legends, such as Vassar Clements, Hylo Brown, Charlie Moore, Raymond Fairchild, Mac Martin and pioneers who have spent their lives staying true to their Rural American roots. The Power Picks series includes new collection titles that focus on traditional Bluegrass & old time country classics that represent the best of standard classics from Rural Rhythm s treasure trove of over 4,000 original masters dating back to 1955 when the label was created."
