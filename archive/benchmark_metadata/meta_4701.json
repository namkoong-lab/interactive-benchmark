        "Whiteside Machine Company has been in the router bit business for over 30 years providing customer with quality products while at the same time striving to achieve complete customer satisfaction. Several woodworking magazines have tested Whiteside versus the competition and selected Whiteside as the winner for best router bits available in the market. Whiteside Machine Company was founded in 1970 as a general purpose machine shop in the basement of Bill & Bobbie Whiteside's home. Located in Western North Carolina near the furniture manufacturing town of Hickory, the company was often involved in making repairs or special parts for the furniture and woodworking field. A strong commitment to customer problem-solving, a can-do attitude, and innovative ideas, along with a growing core of dedicated employees, helped the business evolve into a manufacturer of woodworking equipment and tooling. Primarily through repeat business and referrals, the tooling business continued to grow to meet a demand for quality production router bits as well as custom application tooling. Today, Whiteside Machine occupies a 40,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility and produces a complete line of solid carbide and carbide tipped router bits. Whiteside's quality, innovation, and customer commitment is still present in our superb product line, in the design of custom tooling to fill special customer requirements, and in the development of special machinery and tooling for our own manufacturing use. As always, Whiteside Machine is continuously striving to improve our product through new technology, improved production techniques, and ongoing research and development efforts; along with rigid quality control, vital customer feedback and extensive field testing. Whiteside Machine Company."
