        "If I had to choose one word to sum up all of my problems, this would be it. Without hybrids, I wouldn’t have to watch my best friend slowly becoming a monster. Without hybrids, I could let go of the mentality “hunt or be hunted.” CHAS wouldn’t be scouring the Earth, intent on slaughtering and using Alex to do it. Without hybrids, I wouldn’t have to be on guard that losing my temper meant losing my shape. There would be no monster inside me, struggling to get out. Then again, without hybrids, I wouldn’t have Wesley St. John.Blood Bond is book 3 in the bestselling Dirty Blood series."

A racial divide combinedwith all the hormones and feelings of a teenaged girl with a stubborn streakand a mysterious guy who has experienced more loss than most people can handle.The whole series is designed to make you fall in love--with thecharacters and the story. You'll definitely want to turn the page to find out whathappens next and whether they'll kiss or kill!",
