        "In its second annual holiday collection, Pinnacle's Arabesque line features a trio of upbeat contemporary African American romances, each focusing on a different winter holiday. A successful Washington businesswoman and a stockbroker reclaim the spirit of Christmas and a love they thought they had lost in Shirley Hailstock's \"Invitation to Love.\" A sophisticated ethnic art expert and the head of a Harlem prep school find love in Rochelle Alers's \"First Fruits.\" And a sham engagement between two longtime attorney friends leads to the real thing just in time for New Year's Eve in Angela D. Benson's funny and engaging \"Friend and Lover.\" Sensual, romantic, and modern, these novellas reflect a range of styles and approaches, though they could have been more tightly edited. A unique collection that will appeal to all romance readers.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."
