        "A cruise ship is an easy place to commit murder. Body disposal’s a cinch, and suicide’s the likely verdict. The only problem is determining how to choose the next victim.Sad and sexy, women find Detective Jim Tanger attractive. He doesn’t care. His wife’s suicide three years ago froze his soul. When Jim hears that Sunburst Cruises has lost another young female passenger to an assumed suicide, Jim’s passions erupt. He pushes the department and the cruise line into letting him investigate. Battling seasickness and overwhelming shyness, Jim must protect the women and find the killer only he believes exists.Julie Cooper loves her husband Joel. She hopes their anniversary cruise to Hawaii will be a new beginning for them. Before her suitcases are unpacked, someone unleashes a campaign of terror against her. Anonymous threats, cryptic messages in her cabin, and an attempt on her life force Julie to look at the one person who might want her dead; the one person she trusted with her life."

        "About the Author Rebecca loves to laugh, dream, ponder, and write.

She took on three wildly different genres for her first three novels – a murder mystery at sea (Into Dark Waters), a humorous look at sex and marriage (Diary of a Christian Woman--How I Used 50 Shades of Grey to Spice Up My Marriage), and a children’s chapter book on bullying (The Geek Club, under Becky Reilly). Rebecca has been happily married for thirty years, is the mother of two, and lives in Northern California.).
