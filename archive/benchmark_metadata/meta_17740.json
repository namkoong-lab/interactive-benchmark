        "Defend yourself! Are you suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, repetitive stress injuries and cramping? Wrists locked in an uncomfortable position or flopping around like a rag doll? Here's a way to get some relief for those painful wrists, or, better yet, prevent them from occurring. IronMind's Wrist Defender can work wonders by promoting blood flow, gently relieving pressure in the wrist area, encouraging increased range of motion and added flexibility. A couple of quick minutes with this friendly tool, gently loosening and stretching your joints, can make your fingers and wrists dance instead of drag. It's soft, so it's easy on your body (as well as your desk), with an ergonomic shape and wrist strap that also makes it easy to hold on to. 6\" x 2\" and weighs approximately 1-1/4 lb.; contains no sand or lead."
