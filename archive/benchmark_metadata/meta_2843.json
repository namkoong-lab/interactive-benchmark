        "When pirates hijack a container ship off the coast of Somalia, a sinister plan to cripple the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf and precipitate a war is unleashed. Two North Korean nuclear warheads being smuggled to Iran are the centerpiece of an ISIS plot to distract the world's attention. If they succeed, thousands of people will die in nuclear fire and the world will be at war. Enter OUTCAST (Operational Undertaking To Counteract Active Stateside Threats)--six ex-operatives from six of America’s most powerful organizations. Each has been unceremoniously released by their respective former employer for alleged misdoings that leave their pride wounded but their essential skill-sets untouched. After uniting over their shared bond of dismissal from the nation’s most elite outfits, the disgruntled spooks realize that they can work together like never before to take down threats to their beloved country, a country that branded them as outcasts but needs them now more than ever.As a quiet investigation in South Africa suddenly goes hot, leading to a Somalian pirate base and a night-time assault on the high seas, OUTCAST is hell-bent on showing America that their way isn't the best way--it's the only way.African Firestorm is Book 3 of the OUTCAST Ops series.Game of Drones Book 1. The Poseidon Initiative is Book 2. They can be read in any order."
