He is currently a Senior Researcher at the National Education Policy Center in the School of Education at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He holds the title of Regents\\' Professor Emeritus at Arizona State University. He coined the term \"meta-analysis\" and illustrated its use in 1976. The most extensive illustration of the technique was to the literature on psychotherapy outcome studies, published in 1980 by Johns Hopkins University Press under the title \"Benefits of Psychotherapy\" by Mary Lee Smith, Gene V Glass, and Thomas I. Miller. In 1986, Glass joined the faculty of the Arizona State University. In 1993, he created one of the first online, peer-reviewed scholarly journals in education, the Education Policy Analysis Archives. He is Editor of Education Review, an open access journal of book reviews in education. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Education. In 2006, he was honored with the Distinguished Contributions to Educational Research Award of the American Educational Research Association.']}"
