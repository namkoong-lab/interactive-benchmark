        "Grade 4-7-This well-written, highly readable biography captures the life and times of Louisa May Alcott, prolific and independent writer, dutiful daughter, and devoted nurse during the Civil War. It also provides an insightful look at the Alcott family whose lifestyle was certainly not a conventional one. In particular, the difficulties that Bronson Alcott, Louisa's father, created for his family are effectively depicted. Throughout the book, parallels and contrasts between the Alcotts and the fictional March family unfold. Both Alcott's personal life and writing career are effectively explored. Like the TV biographies, this is a lucid and inspirational production with the A & E trademark conspicuously displayed on the jacket. It covers the same ground as Carol Greene's Louisa May Alcott (Children's, 1984; o.p.) and Norma Johnston's Louisa May (Four Winds, 1991), but still makes a fine addition if biographies are in high demand.",

        "This slim, readable entry in the A&E Biography series will appeal to fans of Little Women; Ruth makes extensive use of Alcott's journal writings and letters and makes clear where real life and fiction converged. The author describes the Alcotts' difficult lives, due in large part to Bronson, whose philosophical views kept the family near bankruptcy. Although Ruth is careful about her sources and end notes, it's not always apparent which ideas and events are hers and which are from Alcott's writings. Still, this is an interesting look at a well-loved figure, with black-and-white reproductions and photographs for added appeal. It's also a de facto introduction to transcendentalism.
