        "Hosea, Amos, and Micah are listed among the Minor Prophets. But make no mistake. Their messages were of major importance to the people of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And they are just as important to us today. During the 8th century B.C., these prophets warned people that thir evil deeds and rejection of God would surely bring His judgment. The Ruin and Restoration of Israel unmistakably shows that God not only exists, but that He does what he promises to do and that there is no escaping from Him. Using a normal, literal-grammatical hermeneutic, this outstanding commentary also paints a moving picture of God's deep love for the Jewish people. And just as He promised to judge them, which He did, He also promises to bless them in the future, which he surely will."
