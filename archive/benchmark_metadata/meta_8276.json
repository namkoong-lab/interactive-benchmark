        "Millhouse is a faint-hearted, hairless guinea pig. A great lover of all things theatrical, most especially the work of William Shakespeare, Milly longs for the limelight and someone to love. However, after the death of his beloved owner, the great actor Sir Roderick Lord Kingswagger, Millhouse is abandoned to a neglected and dusty pet shop filled with other rodents -- some rude, some odd, some cute and some downright frightening. Finding himself a reviled outcast and a target of the nasty Pepper Brown ferret, Millhouse sets about trying to find a way back to the theater and a happy home, and in doing so experiences more drama than he could ever have imagined."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 3–6—As the former pet of the actor, Sir Roderick Lord Kingswagger, Millhouse, a hairless guinea pig, revels in the theater. When Sir Roderick dies, Milly finds himself for sale in a pet store. The other animals despise Milly just for being hairless, but Pepper Brown, the ferret, loathes the guinea pig with a single-minded passion and is determined to make dinner out of him one day. In spite of the danger, Milly sneaks out of his cage at night and practices his Shakespeare, transforming the smallest bits of debris into theater props. The wild mice babies, who live in the walls of the shop, gradually become a voracious audience, and Eliot, the asthmatic rat and a fellow pet shop inmate, becomes a true friend. Predictably, there are a few skirmishes with the dastardly Pepper Brown, but Milly's foray into an actual theater to see a live performance with Peter Ustinov, escorted by the adult wild mice, is a fun surprise with a lively outcome. Many of the scenes in the story are exciting and entertaining, but the lulls among the action-packed events are anticlimactic and slow down the tale's momentum. The main problem with the story may be Milly himself. Although his unkind fellow inmates are criticized as being snobs, the protagonist can also come across as a prima donna. This makes him a less than endearing protagonist, although admittedly this is befitting his upbringing by Sir Roderick Lord Kingswagger.—Kathy Cherniavsky, Ridgefield Library, CT",
