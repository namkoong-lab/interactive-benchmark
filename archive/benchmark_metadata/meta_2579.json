        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 3–7—A mum leaves for a conference, leaving her son and daughter in the care of their dad while she is away. Before she leaves, the dad assures her he has everything under control. And he does for the most part. But, he forgets one simple thing: the milk. Facing the possibilty of having no milk for the kids' cereal or, more importantly, for his own tea, dad leaves to pick up the breakfast staple from the corner store. When he finally returns with the milk later that morning, he has quite an amazing, time-twisting, mind-bending tale to tell. It is a yarn replete with planet-remodeling aliens, savage pirates, blood-thirsty \"wumpires,\" a time-travelling dinosaur scientist, and dancing elves, with touches of humor, philosophy, and feminism. The story is told from the son's point of view, who interjects his father's storytelling with occasional questions and skeptical comments. Gaiman also narrates, and is a committed, energetic storyteller. While it is a fast-paced, rip-roaring adventure, brief mention of throat-slitting, use of guns, and talk of human sacrifice make this recording not quite suitable for the the smallest members of the family. Hilarious, captivating, and just plain fun, this is a production not to miss.—Jennifer Verbrugge, State Library Services, Roseville, MN",

        "A little boy and his little sister awake one morning, milkless. Their mother is away on business, their father is buried in the paper, and their Toastios are dry. What are young siblings to do? They impress upon their father that his tea is also without milk and sit back to watch their plan take effect. But something goes amiss, and their father doesn’t return and doesn’t return some more. When he does, finally, he has a story to tell, a story involving aliens; pirates; ponies; wumpires (not the handsome, brooding kind); and a stegosaurus professor who pilots a Floaty-Ball-Person-Carrier (which looks suspiciously like a hot-air balloon). There is time travel, treachery, and ample adventure, and, fortunately, the milk he has procured is rescued at every turn. Gaiman’s oversize, tongue-in-cheek narrative twists about like the impromptu nonsense it is, with quick turns, speed bumps, and one go-for-broke dairy deus ex machina. Young fills the pages with sketchy, highly stylized images, stretched and pointy, bringing the crazed imaginations to life with irrepressible energy. Children will devour this one, with or without milk. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: A national media campaign and select author appearances are on the docket to celebrate the release of Newbery Award–winning Gaiman’s latest. Grades 3-6. --Thom Barthelmess",
