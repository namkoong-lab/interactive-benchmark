        "There are 100 levels and you only have 20 seconds to solve each of them. You fail - stuff blows up and you continue to the next level, for as long as you beat the entire batch. Batches have 6 levels that you play round and round, since playing 100 levels straight would be too much for a human brain to take.",

Well, unless you can do something about it! And don't think that the solutions will be obvious! it's a point'n'click adventure game after all, so the most obvious choices are bound to fail. and the most annoying adventure game feature has been gotten rid of. I mean, dialogues, monologues and text et all. There is no time for small talks if you only have 20 seconds! So instead of starting a useless banter,",
