        "Don’t get caught in a thunderstorm, hurricane or ice storm without a working can opener. The P-51 Can Opener is perfect for camping, hiking, fishing or for the survivalist in your family. Be sure to carry a P-51 on your key ring, dog tag chain, tackle box or in your emergency survival kit. The P-51 is the larger version of the P-38 and was often used by mess hall cooks to open the big trays and large cans of chow. The P-51 is a full 2\" long. The added length affords more leverage and doesn't require as much thumb pressure to use. Some prefer them over the P-38s because a P-51 will open cans much easier and faster and will last much longer than the P-38. We recommend having one in every car, on every key-ring and included in every emergency survival kit."
