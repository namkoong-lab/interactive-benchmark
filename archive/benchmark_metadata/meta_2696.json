        "When an earthquake hits on their family vacation, can Kyle and his sister survive the following tsunami?",
        "The Worst Vacation Ever! Thirteen-year-old Kyle thought spending a vacation on the Oregon coast with his family would be great. He’d never flown before, and he’s never seen the Pacific Ocean. One evening Kyle is left in charge of his younger sister, BeeBee, while his parents attend an adults-only Salesman of the Year dinner on an elegant yacht. Then the earthquake comes—starting a fire in their hotel! As Kyle and BeeBee fight their way out through smoke and flame, Kyle remembers the sign at the beach that said after an earthquake everyone should go uphill and inland, as far from the ocean as possible. Giant tsunami waves—three or four stories high—can ride in from the sea and engulf anyone who doesn’t escape fast enough. Kyle and BeeBee flee uphill as a tsunami crashes over the beach, the hotel, and the town. The giant wave charges straight up the hillside and through the woods where the children are running for their lives. The perfect vacation has become a nightmare! Somehow Kyle and BeeBee have to outwit nature’s fury and save themselves from tsunami terror."

        "Grade 5-8-An earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hits the Oregon coast where 13-year-old Kyle is vacationing with his family. His parents are on a yacht, celebrating his realtor father's Salesman of the Year award, and Kyle must get his eight-year-old sister out of their burning hotel and up the hill, away from the beach. As they escape, he also saves the life of a bully who has tormented him since grade school. Later, after seeing Daren for the lying coward he is, Kyle stands up to him, ending the abusive behavior. Kyle's self-image is transformed through his experience with the tsunami and the bully. While this is a satisfying read for victims of bullying, it is unremarkable in plot and style. One character does stand out, Kyle's sister, BeeBee, a financial whiz who follows the stock market and names her teddy bear after Bill Gates. A bibliography of books, Web sites, a video, and pamphlets about tsunamis is included.",

        "When 13-year-old Kyle goes to the Oregon shore for a family vacation, little does he realize that disaster awaits. While babysitting his little sister, BeeBee, he must contend with a bullying classmate who is also on the trip, a wild storm, a fire in their ramshackle hotel, and an unexpected tsunami that swamps the coastline. Though Terry Bregy's tone is pleasant, his voice is not convincing as that of a stressed teenager who is facing multiple calamities. Breghy sounds earnest, grandfatherly, and occasionally sanctimonious--qualities that may be attributed in part to an improbable, clichéd plot. Despite these shortcomings, the listener does want to learn what happens to Kyle and his family. M.H.N. © AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine",

That's important when you're a kid and you can only read Large Print, you want your book to look like all the other books. I'm reading a lot more now that we have found Thorndike Press.\" -- Jim Bernardin, Islamorada, FL\"Everyone loves to read, there's nothing like curling up with a good book. We're a reading family, so when our son was diagnosed with Stargardt's Disease and only able to read Large Print, it was particularly difficult. Books on tape are wonderful but they don't fill the void of actually reading a good story. Large Print books have been around a long time for older people, but to find a good novel for a young person in Large Print began to feel nearly impossible. The books that Thorndike Press publishes have truly made a difference in my son's reading life. He can enjoy current novels as well as some of the classics that he missed reading when it became too difficult with regular print.\" -- Sara Bernardin, Islamorada, FL",
