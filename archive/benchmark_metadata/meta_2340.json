        "From the Author",
        "There's a very interesting story behind ONLY US. On April 1, 2010, we celebrated April Fool's Gold Day on my Facebook page. At that time, none of the Fool's Gold books had been released yet, but my fans were happy to celebrate, anyway. (I love that about you!) I invited fans to create a character who would have a speaking role in a future Fool's Gold book. I honestly thought that I would give the character only a walk-on part, but the character they created - Cameron McKenzie, the new Fool's Gold veterinarian - turned out to be so intriguing that I had to write a book for him.We started with nothing. Fans voted on the character's gender, age, occupation, back story, name... and they even gave Cameron an adorable daughter named Kaitlyn and a dog named Noah. Noah is a girl, by the way - yep, my fans came up with that, too!",

She made many appearances in the Top 10 before (finally) hitting #1 in 2015 with Thrill Me, the twentieth book in her popular series, the Fool's Gold romances, and the fourth of five books released that year.\", \"Susan lives in Seattle with her husband, a ragdoll cat, and a small poodle with delusions of grandeur.
