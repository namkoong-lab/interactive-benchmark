        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 9 Up—Who is responsible when a bullied teen commits suicide? Sara and her friends find themselves embroiled in a legal nightmare after new classmate Emma hangs herself following months of their ruthless harassment. In Sara's mind, Emma was at fault: she stole Sara's boyfriend, so retaliation was fair game, and suicide was an unwarranted overreaction. That the story is told from a bully's perspective adds complexity to this compelling, ripped-from-the-headlines novel. The characters are three-dimensional and nobody is completely right or wrong in this realistic exploration of how bullying-related suicide affects everyone involved. Sara is in denial about her reprehensible actions, and readers who love a flawed character will root for her as she comes to terms with her role in Emma's death. It's clear how easily Sara got caught up in the act of bullying through the influence of her mean-girl best friend, Brielle. The two carelessly indulge in cyberbullying as well as face-to-face taunting, effectively demonstrating how cruelty can seem so simple when there are no immediate consequences. Family bonds and a tentatively blossoming romance play a vital role in Sara's journey to self-awareness. This nuanced look at a controversial topic will keep readers hooked until its satisfying conclusion and makes great fodder for discussion among high school students.—Allison Tran, Mission Viejo Library, CA",

        "Sara Wharton is a bully. But not, she insists, a murderer. However, Emma Putnam has committed suicide; she was literally bullied to death, and Sara has been criminally charged. Sara, though, blames Emma, who, she acidly thinks, got off easy. Self-pitying and not a bit sorry, she is a classic antiheroine . . . or is she? As the story moves back and forth in time, before and after the suicide, a fuller portrait emerges as Sara’s first-person voice reveals essential details. Perhaps she might, in the end, come to terms with her actions and even find redemption. First-time novelist Maciel has done an exemplary job of giving readers a multidimensional portrait of a bully that is psychologically acute and emotionally resonant. Readers may not like Sara, but they will come to empathize with her as she discovers the meaning of remorse. Realistic and suffused with truth, Tease is an excellent choice for both independent reading and classroom use. Grades 9-12. --Michael Cart",
