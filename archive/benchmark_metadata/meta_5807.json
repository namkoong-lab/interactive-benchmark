        "Today, one of every three Asian, Domestic and European vehicles on the road in North America includes Bosch braking components. That’s because Bosch has been a key player in the braking industry since applying for its first brake system design patent in 1936. Bosch introduced Antilock Braking technology to market, as well as Electronic Stability Control systems. Now Bosch brings over 70 years of OE braking expertise to the aftermarket with Bosch QuietCast Premium Disc Brake Pads.",
        "Quiet operation and reliable braking performance",

        "The Science Behind the Silence",
        "Every Bosch QuietCast Disc Brake Pad is fitted with the industry’s best pre-attached rubber core shim. This shim style is the most predominant type used by OE manufacturers and is exclusively offered by Bosch for the independent aftermarket.",
        "The laminated rubber-core shim is heat and pressure cured between two layers of steel (see Figure 1, opposite page). This process ensures the highest quality bonding of the rubber to steel resulting in lower noise, increased strength, and corrosion resistance. Sound vibrations pass through the friction material and backing plate, but are dissipated by the unique rubber core in the shim for remarkable noise dampening.",
        "About Molded Shim Technology (MST)",
        "At the time of pressing, heat, adhesive and pressure mold the multi-layer shim to the backing plate and friction material creating an integrally molded unit. The shim stays attached throughout the life of the pad; it won’t walk or slide on the backing plate, providing maximum stability resulting in quieter shim performance over the life of the pad."
