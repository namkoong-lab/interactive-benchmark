        "* Serves 4",
        "Carefully rinse the scallops under cold running water and pat them dry with paper towels. Slice the chorizo into chunks roughly the same size as the scallops. Put the scallops, chorizo and half the thyme in a bowl with some of the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and gently tumble together with your hands, making sure everything is coated.   Thread the scallops, chorizo and tomatoes onto the skewers and sprinkle with the remaining thyme. Heat the remaining oil in two large frying pans over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the skewers and cook for 4–5 minutes, turning every so often, until all sides are browned. One minute before they’re ready, squeeze 1⁄2 lemon over each. Carefully stack the skewers on a serving dish. Reduce the heat and add the other half of the lemon to each pan. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up all the juices on the bottom of the pans and add half the butter to each pan. Cook for a moment, stirring, before drizzling the tasty pink sauce over the skewers.",
