        "ENDORSEMENTS FROM THE BACK COVER \"Diversity Matters is a welcome offering not just in the realm of evangelical Christian higher education, but also in the realm of evangelical Christianity as a whole. Through it, the contributors clearly and courageously address the why, the what, and the how of developing institutions where racial and ethnic diversity can flourish in ways that benefit the institutions and honor God.\" --BISHOP CLAUDE ALEXANDER, pastor of The Park Church in Charlotte, North Carolina",
        "\"The future of Christian higher education is in educating the diversity of God's followers for the work of Christ on earth. This book is a giant step to get us there. Bringing together a who's who of Christian authors on the topic, this volume is a tour de force.\" --MICHAEL O. EMERSON, Provost, North Park University, author, Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America and Transcending Racial Barriers",
        "\"Diversity Matters is a poignant book. It touches on what really matters in the effort to create diverse communities and expand racial equity on campus, in classrooms, at faculty meetings, and more. The writers challenge structural and institutional racial injustices and speak to the heart of diversity and how it can be achieved.\" --GRACE JI-SUN KIM, associate professor of theology, Earlham School of Religion, author, Embracing the Other and Mother Daughter Speak",

To that end, Diversity Matters offers sound advice to all who wish to join in this necessary progress.\" --NOEL CASTELLANOS, President, Christian Community Development Association",
