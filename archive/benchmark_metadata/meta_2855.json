        "To stop her sadistic grandfather, Saul, and his band of time travelers from rewriting history, Kate must race to retrieve the CHRONOS keys before they fall into the Cyrists’ hands. If she jumps back in time and pulls the wrong key—one that might tip off the Cyrists to her strategy—her whole plan could come crashing down, jeopardizing the future of millions of innocent people. Kate’s only ally is Kiernan, who also carries the time-traveling gene. But their growing bond threatens everything Kate is trying to rebuild with Trey, her boyfriend who can’t remember the relationship she can’t forget.",
        "As evidence of Saul’s twisted mind builds, Kate’s missions become more complex, blurring the line between good and evil. Which of the people Saul plans to sacrifice in the past can she and Kiernan save without risking their ultimate goal—or their own lives?"

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 7 Up—Kate has a sense of urgency now that she understands what her evil grandfather, Saul, is planning. In order to stop him from altering time permanently, she must make a series of time jumps to retrieve as many of the Chronos Keys as possible. This is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to avoid the bad guys and, more importantly, other incarnations of herself. If that weren't stressful enough, she's tasked with carrying on/nurturing a relationship with her boyfriend, Trey, whose memories of their romance were wiped out by the time changes. Couple that with Kate's attraction to Kiernan, another teen she allies with in the last century, and you have the makings for a major teen meltdown. Unfortunately, this book falls considerably short of the first installment in the series, in part because of an overabundance of dialogue and not enough action as well as Kate's semi-blasé attitude toward a situation that might destroy everything dear to her. Kate Rudd, however, does a good job of narrating. VERDICT Recommended only where series fans request it.—John R. Clark, Hartland Public Library, ME",
