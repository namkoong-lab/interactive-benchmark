        "HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) Plastic Sheet 3/8\" x 24\" x 48\" Natural Color. High density polyethylene (HDPE) is used in a variety of applications and industries where excellent impact resistance, high tensile strength, low moisture absorption and chemical- and corrosion-resistance properties are required. High density polyethylene is harder than low density polyethylene and has higher tensile strength, and better compressive strength. HDPE has good insulation properties and is easy to weld. The operating temperature is from -58 °F to +194 °F. HDPE is a cost effective material for both indoor and outdoor applications. Material : High Density Polyethylene Shape: Sheet Thickness: 3/8 inch Width: 24 inches Length: 48 inches Finish: Smooth"
