        "\"This essay offers a marvelous new way for lay people like me to read about music... I couldn't tear myself away from it... The self-playing scores and clever annotations let me see and hear what the text drew my attention to... I was immensely interested in the prose. It's the prose of a writer, geared to the pleasure of the reader... The immediately human rendering of musical passages via metaphors is permanently illuminating.\"",
