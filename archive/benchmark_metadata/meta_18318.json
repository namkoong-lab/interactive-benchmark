        "Style, aesthetic, innovation. The ALPINA ALTO is a visor helmet for skiers who like to look good and be able to see everything. The newly designed and perfectly visor translation rotation Mechanism (TRM) sets new standards in terms of comfort. Thanks to TRM, the visor seals extra tightly to the face, thus helping the helmet to sit compactly and comfortably on the head. The ALPINA high-tech lenses ensure optimal visibility and sharp contrast. The ALPINA ALTO’s active air venting structure guarantees active ventilation. At the same time, the clean play of surfaces in combination with the scattered hole structure of the ventilation creates an iconic look."
