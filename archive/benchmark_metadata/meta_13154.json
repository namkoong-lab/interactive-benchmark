        "The adult sized Baby Pants Onezies function to provide warmth and hold diapers, in particular cloth diapers which tend to be bulkier and heavier, in place without sagging. The adult sized Baby Pants Onezie brings all the convenience and practicality of this baby garment to older, larger diaper wearers. Shoulder Snaps are important when it's difficult to dress. Baby Pants Onezies have optional shoulder snaps which make it easier to pull over the head during dressing. Available sizes Small through 4XLarge and with or without shoulder snaps. The Baby Pants label assures you this is another quality product for babies and adults. PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO MEASURE FOR YOUR SIZE. The most critical measurement is the \"Length\" which is best measured with a cloth measuring tape while wearing a t-shirt and diapers. Start at the collar in back running down the back and through the legs over the diaper, up to the collar in front. Divide this measurement by two and compare to the listed length. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ONEZIE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 14% LARGER THAN THE MEASUREMENTS STATED ON THIS PRODUCT PAGE. After washing 2 or 3 times your onezie will shrink to the sizes listed here. They are a very soft high grade organic cotton and as such will exhibit significant shrinking."
