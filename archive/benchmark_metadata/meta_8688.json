        "Doc Holliday is a legendary figure embedded into the psyche of American history. He has been resurrected in countless books, movies, plays and documentaries about the Old West. His name comes to mind as easily as his dime-novel counterparts like Billy the Kid, Jesse James and of course, Wyatt Earp. He has grown in stature and status until it is almost impossible to tell the man from the myth and yet, the man is infinitely more interesting.",
        "L.T. Brooks brings Doc Holliday to life once more in her debut novel, \"The Last Gamble of Doc Holliday.\" However, unlike other tales of the famous gunslinger, she brings to life his story - the whole story. Based on fact, Brooks recounts the days of Docs childhood and introduces readers to the influences that made him the man he would become. Before he was \"Doc,\" he was young John, a child raised in rural Georgia by an adoring mother and a domineering father. He survived the Civil War and family tragedy, learned to find the strength within himself, and recognized love for the gift it was, even when it came from unlikely places. He became his own man and emerged from his childhood with love, dreams and appreciation for life intact  until it was all taken away, forcing him into the life for which became so well known. From Georgia to Tombstone and everywhere in between, the reader sees it all, from Docs first chance to his last gamble.",
        "\"The Last Gamble of Doc Holliday\" takes a myth, a legend  and makes him a man."
