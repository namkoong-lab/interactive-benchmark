        "The title of this masterful and beguiling book is misleading. In Belozersakya's adept hands, exotic animals are mere jumping off points for marvelous adventures through worlds ranging from bustling, heroic Alexandria, Egypt, circa 300 B.C., to the creepy confines of William Randolph Hearst's San Simeon in the mid-20th century. While each of the seven sections revolves around exotic animals—a giraffe in Medici Florence, menageries in 16th-century Prague and Napoleonic France—it's the story that Belozersakya weaves around these beasts that draws the reader on. A common thread is the obsession caused by these fanciful beasts. Rudolf II, spent so much of his kingdom's fortune on collecting animals that there wasn't always enough money to feed his voracious lions. . \"This might explain why on several occasions the Emperor had to recompense servants and subjects mauled by his felines.\" A meticulous researcher, the Russian-born Belozersakya, an art historian who has taught at Harvard and Tufts, uses these tales to consider how exotic animals have served as diplomatic gifts, as \"symbols of power and learning,\" as mirrors of the cultures that prized them. This is a sumptuous read—smart, funny and utterly compelling. 8 illus. not seen by",

        "Exotic animals have always been symbols of power, and the gift of exotic animals was a common way for rulers to cement alliances. Belozerskaya focuses on the rich and powerful whose interest in the animals, and what they later did with them, was a good mirror of the philosophy of their eras. The early Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt, in the aftermath of the breakup of Alexander the Great's empire, needed elephants for their armies. The Roman Empire used the exotic animals sent as tribute to Rome, or captured from conquered territories, pitted against each other or against humans in the famous circuses. The Medici prince Lorenzo the Magnificent consolidated his power in Florence by working behind the scenes, but proof of his power came in the form of the gift of a giraffe from an Egyptian sultan. And in the final tale, pandas are given to Richard Nixon after his wife commented to Mao Zedong on how much she liked them. Although academically wordy, this look at the role of animals in international politics will interest both history and animal lovers.",

        "I've always read books to travel to other worlds. Growing up in Moscow, in the Brezhnev era, I dove into books to transport myself from the drabness and oppression of Soviet life to more fascinating places. After I emigrated to America and enrolled in high school in Boston, I read novels during math classes because I had already studied that curriculum in Russia and preferred the humanities anyway. To escape academic politics as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and as an aspiring teacher at Harvard, Tufts, and Boston Universities, I buried myself in history books and consoled myself with the knowledge that my time of reading and writing was a haven where I could always find refuge and joy. Then a true gift from the gods fell into my lap: two years of a Bunting Fellowship (administered by Radcliffe, at Harvard), during which I had the luxury of reading and writing to my heart's content. In that blissful environment I produced my first two books, Rethinking the Renaissance: Burgundian Arts Across Europe and Luxury Arts of the Renaissance (both witnesses to my first career as an art historian). It was during those fellowship years that I decided to relocate to my dream world entirely and devote myself to writing full time and doing so on any subject that struck my imagination. In my second year at the Bunting I came up with the idea for The Medici Giraffe. I am exceedingly lucky that my husband supports my escapist tendencies, my writing habit, and my daily living between book advances, as well as inspires me with his always clever ideas and erudition in ancient history and archaeology, his fields of expertise that tend to somehow find their way into my books. And I am fortunate that my dog takes me out on daily walks, making me surface for air and fresh thoughts. There are books one reads once and enjoys with every page, such as Ann Patchett's Bel Canto and Myla Goldberg's Bee Season. Others provide great inspiration: Sabina Murray's Caprices did so for me at the Bunting, when I decided to move into creative writing. And then there are a few favorites that become friends for a lifetime. Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita was our family bible when I was growing up, and it brought my husband and me together. I return to it for enchantment every few years. To find books on any subject I happen to be researching, I always go to Harvard's online library catalogue. It is a book lover's virtual paradise. Marina Belozerskaya was born in Moscow, USSR and was an award-winning teacher at Harvard, Tufts, and Boston Universities. She currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband, a curator at The J. Paul Getty Museum, and her own exotic animal, a Vizsla named Audrey.",

Growing up in Moscow, in the Brezhnev era, I dove into books to escape the drabness and oppression of Soviet life. After emigrating to America and enrolling in high school in Boston, I read novels during math classes because I never like that subject, could get away with avoiding it in the more lenient American school, and sought greater excitement of the written word. Dispirited by academic politics as a graduate student and an aspiring professor, I found in reading and writing safe harbors of refuge and joy.\", 'A Bunting Fellowship (administered by the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard) gave me an idea to devote myself to these forms of indulgence full-time. I did not think of myself as a born writer, not like people who begin constructing stories at age 5 and never stop. I was astonished when one day, chancing upon a tattered notebook I had brought with me from Russia, I opened its cover and read on its opening page: \"Chapter 1 - How I began to write.\" My best friend and I spent countless afternoons creating an elaborate fictional world in which we were captains of a pirate ship, sailing across stormy seas and lording it over a motley crew that included Dumas\\' Three Musketeers, popular Russian bards, and other heroes of our youth. We embarked on these adventures first with the help of dolls, then paper cut-outs, then notebooks in which we feverishly scribbled our stories, inspired by all sorts of books we read, but especially those set in the past. I guess the desire to read and write about history has been with me since my childhood after all.', \"History remains the subject of endless fascination for me, a driving motor behind my books, a lens through which I view the world around me. It might be my Russian roots, my emigrant's deracination, or just innate curiosity that always makes me wonder how things came about, and why.\"]}"
