        "All of Yoga, Ancient and New! This comprehensive all-in-one workout will not only give you a longer leaner yoga body, but also a stronger cleaner yoga mind! This journey into the heart of yoga is a fusion between Kundalini and Power Yogas and a breath and movement, strength building, flexifying, beautifying, age-defying all and everything yoga romp (with amazing music leading the way). The bootcamp concept means that keeping up, you deliver yourself to greatness, transform your body and mind, and rewrite the book of your life. This workout is for ALL LEVELS.",
        "P.S. Re: the Power Yoga segment on our this DVD. Not your typical sun salutes with warrior poses. It's Kundalini style of course, and even includes Breath of Fire in a few of the poses. It's designed to get you off the floor (where so many KY sets take place) and, using your own body weight, give you a beautiful balanced musculature. This powerful flow sequence is followed by some Kundalini Yoga Kriyas to take you to new levels of energy and self-discovery. This fun fitness is designed to keep you inspired in your yoga practice and life!"
