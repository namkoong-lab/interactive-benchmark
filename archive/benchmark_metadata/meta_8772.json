        "Once upon a time, the world’s greatest heroine was reimagined by a comic book legend.   More than 40 years after debuting in ALL STAR COMICS #8, Wonder Woman was reshaped by legendary comics creator George Pérez and returned to the public eye in 1986. This updated Amazonian Princess met with such acclaim that Pérez’s original six-month commitment to the title was extended—and extended—until nearly five years had passed. Working with co-writer Len Wein and a host of talented inkers (including Bob McLeod, Dick Giordano, Bruce Patterson and Bob Smith), Pérez brought Wonder Woman to a new generation of readers—and to unprecedented levels of success.   Now these groundbreaking stories are available in an all-new trade paperback edition. Collecting WONDER WOMAN #15-24 and WONDER WOMAN ANNUAL #1, this second volume in the series also includes a special gallery of archival art and information."

        "About the Author",
        "George Pérez started drawing at the age of five and hasn't stopped since. Born on June 9, 1954, Pérez began his professional comics career as an assistant to Rich Buckler in 1973. After establishing himself as a penciller at Marvel Comics, Pérez came to DC in 1980, bringing his highly detailed art style to such titles as JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA and FIRESTORM. After co-creating THE NEW TEEN TITANS in 1980, Pérez and writer Marv Wolfman reunited for the landmark miniseries CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS in 1985. In the aftermath of that universe-smashing event, Pérez revitalized WONDER WOMAN as the series' writer and artist, reestablishing her as one of DC's preeminent characters and bringing in some of the best sales the title has ever experienced. He has since gone on to illustrate celebrated runs on Marvel's",
        "The Avengers, CrossGen's Solus",
        ", and DC's THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD."
