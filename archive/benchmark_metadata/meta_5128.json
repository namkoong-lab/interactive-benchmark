        "Adopt a cuddly fossil friend today with Paleozoic Pals from the Paleontological Research Institution. The Paleozoic is the era before dinosaurs, during which animal life first diversified in the seas, and eventually came ashore to become land vertebrates. Great for fossil-lovers of all ages, this soft Gorgonops plushie is ready to climb into your arms. Gorgonops may look like a big lizard, but it was actually more closely related to mammals! It belonged to a group of animals called therapsids, which include mammals and their ancestors."
