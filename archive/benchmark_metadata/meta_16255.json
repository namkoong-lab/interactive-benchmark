        "ARTISAN STORY:",
        "Local artisan Naree grew up in Trang province in the southern part of Thailand. Naree's family members are merchants so she grew up learning about business and trade. She wanted to make and produce something of her own so she started learning about making jewelry and the processes. It took Naree years of practice but her skills improved and she was finally able to open her own shop in Bangkok. She loves to create beautiful handmade jewelry and is thrilled when others appreciate her designs."
