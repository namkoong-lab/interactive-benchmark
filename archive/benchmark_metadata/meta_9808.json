        "The traditional marine Weather Station is perfect for any boater or outdoorsman who wants to monitor the weather at a glance. This functional yet attractive set gives the user three essential elements in the weather equation: air pressure, air temperature and relative humidity. Three traditional marine instruments are mounted on a beautiful solid mahogany plaque. The easy to read instruments are a quartz clock, a barometer, and a comfortmeter (combination thermometer/hygrometer). The plaque measures 12 inches x4 1/4 inches and can be mounted vertically on a wall in the home, office or on the bulkhead of a boat."
