        "When a young girl mysteriously disappears Police Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward of THE EQUALIZER) travels to a remote Scottish island to investigate. But this pastoral community led by the strange Lord Summerisle (a brilliant performance by the legendary Christopher Lee) is not what it seems as the devout Christian detective soon uncovers a secret society of wanton lust and pagan blasphemy. Can Howie now stop the cult s ultimate sacrifice before he himself comes face-to-face with the horror of THE WICKER MAN? Britt Ekland Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt co-star in this provocative shocker written by Anthony Shaffer (SLEUTH FRENZY) that fans and critics worldwide still consider a true cult classic and a modern horror masterpiece. This is the acclaimed U.S. theatrical version of THE WICKER MAN now fully restored from original vault materials for the first time ever.
