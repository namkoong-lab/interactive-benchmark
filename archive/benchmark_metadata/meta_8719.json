        "Hayley writes from the beautiful Sunshine Coast in Australia, usually with a cat perched on her keyboard. She has a background in archaeology and has published books in multiple genres before turning her hand at crime to win The Kindle Book Review Reader's Choice Award in 2019 and the Scarlet Stiletto's HQ Fiction 'Best Thriller' category in 2020. The 'Lady Vigilante' Crime Series is a fast-paced, action-filled adventure that juxtaposes the quintessential 'Avon Lady' against the chauvinistic underbelly of 1940's New York. This series has been selected as a finalist in numerous international novel and screenplay awards, and a podcast of the series is currently in production.When she's not writing or spending time with her husband and three children, Hayley enjoys running and collecting vintage teacups.
