        "\"The Coney Island piece is great! As is Aviona. It took me on enchanting travels to so many places/carousels I have (and haven't) visited in my lifetime, full of wonder and fantasy.\"-Dr. Floyd L. Moreland (Seaside Heights Dr. Floyd L. Moreland Carousel)Writer's Digest Book Review 12/6/2021 \"This book is exemplary in its structure, organization, and pacing. The structure of the chapters/parts aid in a compelling organization of the story or information. The pacing is even throughout and matches the tone/genre of the book.This book has spelling, punctuation, and grammar corresponding with the region of the world from which the author hails (ex. British English or American English) or with where the book is set (including slang, vernacular, or dialect). These choices are intentional and implemented consistently throughout with few, if any, errors.This book is exemplary in production quality and cover design. The physical materials, printing, and binding are of professional quality and traditional industry standards. The typesetting and page layout (including illustrations, images, or figures) are easy to follow, thoughtfully designed, and error free. The cover appears to be professionally designed and is compellingly related to the content/genre of the book.The book is gorgeous. I love the cover and the paper stockThis book is exemplary in its choice of topic or theme of the story. It is unique but still has strong appeal for most readers in its intended genre. If the book is fiction or narrative nonfiction, the book is well plotted. If the book is poetry or prescriptive nonfiction, there is a cohesive theme or delivery of information.This is an enchanting book. A must read for children of all ages.This book is exemplary in character appeal (or interest) and development. All main characters (including antagonists) are unique and fully fleshed out with compelling, layered motivations and traits. Secondary characters are unique and have a meaningful purpose.This book is exemplary in its voice and writing style. It has a unique voice, and the writing style is consistent throughout. The style and tone are also consistent with or will appeal to readers of the intended genre.This book is delightful. Aviona reminds me of my favorite, fictional sentient toys, Corduroy, The Velveteen Rabbit, Winnie the Pooh, and so on. The plot is appealing, part Pinocchio, part Narnia. I love the scene where Peggy and Aviona land in Memphis at Graceland. The nostalgia for Elvis and a simpler time when Bear and Rising Sun were all he needed washed over me. The lone, gray catbird was a nice touch. I like to think that the soul of Elvis was watching (291-4). Ruff does a masterful job of tying loose ends and casual references together. For instance, on page 96, a nonplussed teenager sees Aviona flying in the sky above New York and observes that, \"They are probably making a movie about Pegasus!\" (96). This is a brilliant way for the author to justify having Aviona fly around one of the world's busiest cities without causing much panic. Ruff gets even more traction from the myth of Pegasus when the author revisits this image on page 346 as Aviona gives her speech aboard the Queen Mary 2. \"How many of you have heard of Pegasus?\" (346) Aviona asks the audience. Then she proceeds to link belief in the enchantment of carousel horses with belief in the American Dream. This is heady stuff. I love the epilogue; it circles back to the prologue with grace and intelligence. I really appreciate all the historical research, too.\"-Writer's Digest 12/6/21",
