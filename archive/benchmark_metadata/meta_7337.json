        "In this family memoir, the author's lyric remembrances alternate with the testimony of her eight brothers and sisters to form a loving portrait of their father. Set in the 1950s and early 1960s, the story takes the reader inside their big family, and highlights the intense contrast between its warmth and the sometimes cold outside world. In remembering their father, the children reveal echoes of his character within their own."
