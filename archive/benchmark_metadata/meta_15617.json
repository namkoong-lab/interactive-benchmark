        "Becoming Bold Luna might be a Ravenclaw, but she sure would fit into Gryffindor too! Why? Well, because she's one of the bravest characters out there! We're not just talking about the moments that she faced danger to make sure the Death Eaters weren't going to triumph. We're talking about something much scarier. We're talking about the times she stayed true to herself. Her classmates were always giving her a hard time but she squared her shoulders and kept on reading the Quibbler upside down and believing in magic creatures that no one else could see. In short, she taught us all a lesson that's valuable for any kid, wizard or no! Does your child want to dress up like the bold Luna Lovegood? This licensed costume fully flaunts her wild style, letting your kiddo slip into character as soon as it arrives at your door! Costume Details This fully licensed Luna Lovegood costume from Harry Potter features a knee-length skirt with a wild pattern. The pink jacket secures up the back. It's designed after the tweed jacket that Luna wears in the movies. Big buttons are printed on the front. Printed seams add extra details to make the jacket look tailored. Complete with Luna's striped socks, this costume is going to delight your little Luna! Magic Moments It's easy to create magic with this colorful costume! It's easy to go all out and make it your own. Pair this costume with sensible boots that are just perfect for long-distance trick-or-treating.
