        "The100 PSI Crossfire Tire Equalizer valve by Dual Dynamics for tires with a normal tire pressure setting of 100 PSI. The tire pressure valve assists in decreasing rolling resistance for increased fuel mileage while improving stability, braking and overall safety. The valve installs in minutes, requires little maintenance including cutting maintenance time due to a single-point inflation and features a visual pressure gauge. Crossfire is a pressure equalizing and monitoring valve that is mounted between dual tires. It bolts easily to the lug, Hubcap, or drive axle end. When you properly mount this valve, air freely flows from one tire to the other, maintaining equal tire pressure and load distribution."
