        "Roof BITE tapes were designed by PARR Technologies as a one part solution for roof repairs, seaming, flashing, cover, RV repairs and general waterproofing applications. This innovative line of products were designed for both commercial and residential roofing applications as a single step solution for long term success. Formulated by PARR for long life cycles, these products will increase the energy efficiency of your roof system. Unlike competitors' materials, PARR's adhesive will not oxidize over time, crack or harden. It is a flexible seal that will adjust with the natural movements of your roofing and building system. A light mineral spirit can be used to ensure a contaminant free surface. Freight Class 55 “non-hazard”. Shelf Life 5 Years Color Adhesive – Gray (will not stain surfaces.) STEP 1: Surface must be clean and dry, moisture, dust, dirt and other foreign matter should be removed before use of project. STEP 2: Cut to length. STEP 3: Remove release liner. STEP 4: Apply using even pressure across the width of the product forcing bond between surfaces. STEP 5: Smooth out all air bubbles. For extreme bubbles, with a razor, create a small puncture and apply weight or pressure over the bubble. The BITE compound will reseal itself. We used a unique blend of our butyl technology and blended it with our proprietary block co-polymer synthetics to create a wide temperature application range adhesive that will adhere on wet surfaces at temperatures below 0ºF, while maintaining their thermal stability at temperatures up to 300ºF. Having difficulty adhering to some surfaces? No problem for PARR, being a lab driven manufacture we had the wide variety of surfaces and other adhesives you might come into contact with in mind. This proprietary adhesive blend will not allow for plasticizer migration like other butyls when in prolonged contact with TPO, EPDM, Asphalt and Coal Tar BURs, CPE and Vinyls."
