        "Mole comes from a family of rich, spicy sauces prepared throughout the Oaxaca and Puebla regions of Mexico, and all mole sauces have a unique flavor. All moles have varying levels of spicy, smoky, and earthy-sweet notes from a complex, layered blend of chiles, spices, dried fruits, and seasonings. Mexican Mole Powder is simply an easy way to add all the flavors of mole as one convenient to add ingredient. This time saving step is important given that moles are notorious for having a high number of ingredients. Our Mexican Mole Powder is earthy, nutty, with noticeable fruitiness and hints of chocolate.",
        "Mole - the dish - is typically served with tortillas or rice and the thick mole sauce is served over turkey, chicken, and seafood. You don't have to use our Mexican Mole Powder to make a sauce that's thick and clingy. We've used Mexican Mole Powder as the sauce for tamales and empanadas, and as a seasoning for chile. To create a simple mole paste that can be thinned out and used in a myriad of ways, mix 3/4 cup of Mexican Mole Powder with 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable broth.",
