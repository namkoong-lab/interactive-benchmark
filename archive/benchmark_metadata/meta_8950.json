        "About the Author",
        "Brooke Bartz is a stay-at-home wife and mom who lives daily with a chronic disease, knowing firsthand the daunting, gnawing physical and spiritual pain it causes. Yet disease was not always her close companion; in the years before her diagnosis, she grew up playing sports and earned a full scholarship to play volleyball at the University of Mary Hardin Baylor. Not yet a Christian, she transferred colleges and attended an event for an on-campus ministry; as the Lord had planned, she heard the Gospel and He saved her. Soon after and while still in college, she married her childhood crush and began a volleyball coaching career. Living with rheumatoid arthritis and gastroparesis, Brooke desires for women to know the truth about the God who loves them and is with them each day as they face disease and disability; she shares the Truth of the Bible as their ultimate healing. Brooke's passion is spurring on the women God leads to her sphere of influence, inspiring their hearts to keep their strength and hope at the foot of the cross, to trust in the Great Shepherd to one day heal them completely in glory, even though for now they are suffering on earth.",
