        "The action legend himself -- Jackie Chan (",
        "Shanghai Noon",
        ",",
        "Rush Hour",
        ") -- explodes across the screen in a power-packed adventure that critics agree captures some of the most incredible action stunts ever. When the British government is discovered smuggling precious Chinese artifacts out of the country, folklore hero Wong Fei Hung (Chan) uses his uniquely outlandish style of martial arts -- Drunken Boxing -- to fight the conspirators and salvage the valuables before it's too late. And the more Hung drinks, the more agile he becomes -- able to fend off numerous attacks with unbelievable moves. With Chinese treasures and family pride on the line, Hung steps up to every chall enge. It's a fun and unstoppably entertaining hit!"
