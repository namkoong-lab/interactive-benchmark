        "A long-buried corpse unearthed at the site of a 1970s New Orleans strip joint leads to additional murders in this engaging and improbable mystery, the third from the author of The Glory Hole Murders. In 1991, the dead body of a male hippie is discovered in an addition, constructed 20 years earlier, to the building that had then been Madame Julie's. Homicide Lt. Frank Washington enlists the aid of Margo Fortier, formerly a stripper named Cherry who is now a newspaper columnist and wife-of-convenience to socially prominent (and secretly gay) Julian Fortier. As Margo checks out old co-workers, the corpse is identified as a youngster who had hung around Madame Julie's and even proposed to one of the dancers. Soon, however, people around the ex-stripper begin to die, and the plot turns predictable. Thankfully, Margo's breezy patter never does, as she offers observations on the Gulf war and frantically schemes to prevent Julian from being outed. Though low on suspense, this talky little tale gets high marks for entertaining chatter. Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "New Orleans society reporter Margo Fortier (The Closet Hanging, Carroll & Graf Pubs., 1987) helps police solve a 1970 murder for two reasons: she aspires to investigative journalism and, more importantly, she used to strip at the club where workers found the body. Her marriage of convenience to a socially prominent gay man provides her with a best friend and sounding board as well as a needed social entree, so Margo can interview anyone-from bartender to society maven-with impunity. Intriguing characters, French Quarter backdrops, and slick prose add elan. Recommended.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "The discovery of a 20-year-old corpse in the wall of Madame Julie's, a New Orleans strip joint, turns out to be a big break for Times-Picayune gossip columnist Margo Fortier, whose long marriage of convenience to barely closeted society scion Julian Fortier hides her former identity as Cherry, a veteran of Julie's. Now, Margo hopes to make the leap to hard news, armed with her identification of the body as peacenik Eric Dowd and her friendship with the other strippers: wigged-out fortuneteller Eileen (Samantha) Herd, lesbian friend-of-battered-wives Toby (the Texas Tornado) Castle, and ageless gymnast Sheila Casey, still plying her trade in Bourbon Street ever since Eric's disappearance cost her the chance to become Mrs. Dowd. There's not an ounce of gravity in the buried-secrets plot; even the present-day detection, set against the background of Desert Storm, is a dose of instant nostalgia. Mildly diverting lightweight fare, pleasantly toned down from the in-your-face Gay Pride antics of The Closet Hanging (1987). --",
