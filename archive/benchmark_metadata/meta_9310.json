        "Review",
        "\"This is hands-down the most effective introductory text I have encountered, and my students love it. . . . It is the essential text for students who are being introduced to the field of criminal justice. Compressed, yet thorough, the text enabled me to address each area of the criminal justice system in a 16-week course. . . . My students enjoy the text because it is so accessible. They feel they are better able to master the material. . . . I do not have to use precious time in class reiterating the information contained in the chapters; rather, students are able to work through the subjects independently with the Web tools as a guide. . . . A very clearly written text.\"\"Interesting, accurate and timely presentation of terrorism and cyber crime. . . . Good, simple explanation of the court systems and the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and judges. . . . Good comparison of federal criminal courts and military courts; today most of us have several military students and this is helpful in explaining the differences in the court systems.\"",
