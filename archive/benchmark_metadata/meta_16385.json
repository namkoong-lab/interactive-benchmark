        "This beautiful kurti/tunic features beautiful design in a rama green color. With long sleeves and a beaded neckline, this stunning tunic is handmade by artisans in IndiaStory Behind the Art: The kurti fabric is woven into beautiful designs on power looms by artisans who have been following the trade for generations, toiling day and night to give the cloth its intrinsic beauty and cool nature. Besides weaving, a fair number of kurtis have further attractive designs embellished on them by skilled artists. Color block printing by hand, hand-painting by talented painters, sewing on bejeweled embellishments by craftsmen to produce unique designs are just some of the efforts that go into making these extremely comfortable and fashionable kurtis."
