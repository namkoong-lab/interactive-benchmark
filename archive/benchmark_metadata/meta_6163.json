        "Metra 72-7300 Speaker Wiring Harnesses For select Hyundai vehicles. These harnesses allow you to plug your new speakers into the factory connectors present in your vehicle's speaker openings. Note: Some aftermarket speakers have terminals that are wider than this harness's slide-on connectors. You may need to widen the harness's female slide-on connectors, or use the slide terminals that may be included with the speakers. If you need to connect your new speaker's connectors to the harness, soldering is best, and crimping is also very popular."
