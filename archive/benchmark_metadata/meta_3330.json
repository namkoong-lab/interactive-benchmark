        "Andy's Hot 'N' Spicy Chicken Breading were created for those brave souls that like a fiery kick to their food. This alternative to our Mild Chicken Breading still has our traditional 'Old South' recipe at its core, but we've added an additional mix of spices that give this breading a Big and Bold flavor that makes your taste buds stand at attention. Andy's Hot 'N' Spicy Chicken Breading will give your chicken a spicy, peppery kick you won't find anywhere else."
