        "DAMO's cup wheels are designed for profiling edges, smoothing out inside sinkhole cuts, smoothing rough surfaces, preparation of material for lamination and heavy stock removal. They are the premium choice for any grinding, shaping or beveling work of concrete, granite, and other stones.",
        "Utilizing the latest \"Multilayer Vacuum Brazed Technology,\" the cup wheels are super aggressive, so the operator doesn't need to apply a lot of pressure when pressing down, the cup wheels will naturally use the gravitational force for operation unlike the conventional cup wheels. They really make the job easy loaded for the operator.",
        "All of DAMO's cup wheels are balanced by Dynamic Balancer, which will prevent your angle grinder to vibrate vigorously for unsafe operation as well as premature failure.",
        "DAMO's cup wheels are designed with special swirl turbo segments which act as a turbofan for quick cooling of the working cup wheels. This will help prevent high temperatures that will lead to short life and less aggressiveness of the cup wheels.",
        "The coarse type (diamond grits 30/40) is used for aggressive grinding. The medium type (diamond grits 70/80) is for slower grinding action.",
        "They are designed for dry applications but work very well during wet applications. They can be used on most popular high-speed angle grinders with 5/8\"-11 threaded spindles.",
        "You may buy seperately our adapter 5/8\"-11 to M14 to use with power tools with M14 thread spindle.",
        "You may purchase separately our 5\" Dust Shroud to help eliminate dusts for concrete floor applications. It is sturdy, simple and collects dusts very effectively with most vacuum systems.",
        "We DAMO Diamond Tools, LLC holds exclusive distribution to DAMO Trademark products as you can see clearly marked from the picture on the product listing."
