        "For science fiction novels lovers",
        "A modern Robinsonade about UFOs, aliens and the adventure to live an ordinary life, back to nature.",
        "Connor Lewis is a loner. Some years ago, he turned his back on the hectic world. Since then, he has surrounded himself in a cocoon of alternative world views and technological whimsies. One day, he decides to attempt a momentous experiment. Something that even he - a quixotic fantasist - has, until now, dismissed as highly unrealistic and impracticable; to contact possible extraterrestrial lifeforms.",
        "Yet here in the desert, unobserved by the rest of the world, he starts to make his plan a reality.",
        "˃˃˃ This science fiction novel has ~340 printed pages and contains 23 illustrations.",
        "The author takes the reader into the isolated world of a maladjusted person and weaves events and experiments into this scientific fantasy narrative - things that a small group of independent UFO researchers of our own time has really experienced and carried out. This story is also an appeal for a re-assessment, for an alternative lifestyle, for doubting our own habitual convictions and the truths that we learn and never question.",
        "It is now left to the reader to discover which part of the story is true",
        "- and which is fiction...",
        "˃˃˃ Excerpt from the chapter \"Fastwalkers\"",
        "...Connor’s thoughts don’t get any further than that. Out of the corner of his eye, he becomes aware of a movement. Very fast, noiseless. He turns to look in the direction of what he thinks is the source of the movement - and starts.",
        "The stars have disappeared!",
        "The entire, shimmering dark blue of the night has been replaced by a deep black. Only slowly does he see that this is only the case for a limited - if large - section of the firmament. One section to the right shows a very clearly drawn line a hand’s breadth above the horizon of hill range and treetops. This is so long that he can’t see the end of it from his viewpoint through the narrow viewing slit. But one thing becomes abruptly clear to him: it’s not that the stars have disappeared from their usual places - they are being covered. And this blackness above him - that’s an unimaginably vast object! Not a hovering ball of light, like he has seen in so many images. No, there is a gigantic thing in the airspace above him. An enormous, dark apparition. Not a trace of blinking lights, no colorful corona, like in all the cheap, CGI films.",
        "An amazingly impressive, evidently hovering object at least the size of a medium-sized town dominates the scene. Connor can only see parts of its surface, but it stretches far across the landscape, far beyond his little cultivation. And what he has read in so many eyewitness accounts is true: not a single sound can be heard! What kind of energy could be keeping this monstrous something in the air and all without emitting anything audible? Even more amazing - shouldn’t he be able to sense something of this energy? Shouldn’t that kind of upward propulsion also generate an accompanying force in the opposite direction? Shouldn’t he be stuck to the ground down here, perhaps even utterly squashed? No, the physics of this seem to be entirely unfettered, to be independent of all known laws. If it does obey any at all, then they must be ones that have so far eluded human curiosity...",
