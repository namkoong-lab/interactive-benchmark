        "ISBNS - International Standard Book Numbers: A Desktop Resource For Self-Publishing Authors is an author’s resource about a subject they hear about all of the time and that publishing platforms require but most authors really don’t know anything about ISBNs. I have 10-years of college and five degrees. People expect me to know things that I simply don’t know and sometimes don’t want to know. I sincerely could have done without the knowledge of colonics and what a “Brazilian” is when the girls in my office began gabbing about these two subjects. I always thought a Brazilian was a tiny little dude from Rio de Janero…no it’s not…go with me on this one. I’m still trying to figure out the lyrics to the 60s song “Louie Louie” and I have no idea where flies sleep at night (lol). So much for 10-years of college! Here’s my point: there are some things we encounter daily that we know little about but use these things daily too. Furthermore, we also use words in our speech and writing that we don’t REALLY know what they mean or have a very slight understanding to their meaning. ISBNs are one such subject. When I woke up to this realization, I decided to publish desktop compendiums where readers could access information quickly and learn things that they needed to know. My first compendium was titled “Latin Phrases.” I was amazed at how often we use Latin phrases in the English language but even more amazed how many of these phrases the users didn’t know the meaning of but used them anyway. Phrases like “carpe diem (seize the day), non-sequitar (it does not follow), or quid pro quo (this for that). To add some zest to my Latin Phrases book, I even included some funny Latin phrases: Volo anaticulam cumminosam meam! - I want my rubber ducky! Visne saltare? Viam Latam Fungosam scio - Do you want to dance? I know the Funky Broadway. Veni, Vidi, volo in domum redire - I came, I saw, I want to go home. Vale, lacerte! - See you later, alligator! Vah! Denuone Latine loquebar? Me ineptum. Interdum modo elabitur - Oh! Was I speaking Latin again? Silly me. Sometimes it just sort of slips out. Tum podem extulit horridulum - You are talking crap. Since I wrote Latin Phrases I have introduced three other “phrase” compendium books: Investment Phrases, Legal Phrases, Real Estate Phrases. ISBNS - International Standard Book Numbers: A Desktop Resource For Self-Publishing Authors is the fifth book in this series and teaches a subject that all authors should know about in detail. This book also addresses where authors can get ISBNs. The prices are all over the board and I have provided resources where you can acquire them reasonably."
