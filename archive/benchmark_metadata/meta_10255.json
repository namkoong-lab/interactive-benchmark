        "Poor Brenda Kahn. Her first two albums predated Liz Phair and Lisa Loeb, but it's hard to listen to Kahn's third set,",
        "Destination Anywhere",
        ", and not hear a combination of those artists' worst tendencies, plus an added dose of pretension. Like her insufferable pal, Jeff Buckley, Kahn thinks she's a serious poet, but she's gotta do better than images of \"schoolyard shamen\" and descriptions like \"pretty as a Harlem whorehouse.\" Musically, her flat, monotone vocals wear thin even quicker than Phair's, and if there was a hook in any of these 11 tunes, I didn't hear it.",
