        "David Blaze's humorous novel, My Fox Ate My Cake, is the second in Blaze's fantasy series about a young boy and his best friend, a talking fox. I loved the first book, My Fox Ate My Homework, and was thrilled to discover this sequel. It's every bit as good as the first one! These two buddies have got to be my favorite literary preteen heroes; they're loyal to a fault and still have that juvenile sense of humor that giggles at farts. Blaze gives Fox some social media exposure, and the plot gets even more outrageous after that. Get this for your preteen who hates reading and see what happens, or better yet, get it for yourself if you still have your own well-developed juvenile sense of humor. My Fox Ate My Cake is most highly recommended. --",

        "My Fox Ate My Cake by David Blaze is a beautiful story for young readers -- and adults who are children at heart. Meet Jonah Johnson and his best friend, a fox. Jonah gets into all sorts of problems since the day he met the talking fox. But this time, it's the fox who is in trouble. It's been captured by the most dreaded person in school -- the school bully himself. This time, it's Jonah's chance to show loyalty to his best friend. Characters like Jonah, Shane the bully, Melissa, who is empathetic, Dana, who is courageous and stands up to the bully, and others are really memorable and well-developed. The themes of friendship, bullying, and self-confidence are masterfully explored in this book and it is no doubt that young readers will have a lot to learn from it. The prose is beautiful and the author's narrative is perfect and accessible to readers of all ages. The setting is a great environment where kids learn and grow, and at times do this the hard way. My Fox Ate My Cake is an entertaining read and David Blaze is joining my list of favorite children's authors. --",

        "My Fox Ate My Cake is a wonderful story by David Blaze that will have you believing it's possible for a fox to stand up and talk. Jonah--or Joe--is the 12-year-old main character who doesn't like Shane Connors, the class bully. And Joe didn't want Shane at his surprise birthday party. Joe's best birthday present is the gift of Fox. The fewer people who knew they had a talking fox the better. Unfortunately, Shane the bully videotaped Fox talking. What can Joe and his mother do to protect Fox? What would you do if someone posted your secret on the Internet and over 3 million people saw it? I didn't want to put the book down ... I needed to know what was going to happen to Fox. This book takes the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I can't believe so much could happen in four days. Author David Blaze is an excellent storyteller and I look forward to reading more of his books. My Fox Ate My Cake is a page-turner that children--and their parents--will enjoy reading! --",
