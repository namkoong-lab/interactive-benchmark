        "Knowledge is not power but only a ‘potential power’. We are today equipped with great knowledge acquired through teachers and books by years of education and through internet and media. Yet our life continues to be miserable because we either don’t know how to use knowledge or we often use it in the wrong way. Only a wise person knows how to use knowledge to achieve the goals of his or her life.Knowledge is the source of wisdom just as food is the source of our life. The challenge is to assimilate the knowledge acquired through different sources and make it ‘alive’ through the power of our Soul—using our intuition and judgment. While it is true that wisdom comes from ‘within’—but the trigger of wisdom is given by knowledge that makes us ‘think’ and create ‘thoughts’ that are deeply connected with real life.The thirty essays written by Dr. Awdhesh Singh stirs your mind and make you think ‘thoughts’ that connects and harmonizes the apparent contradictions of diverse thoughts and awaken your wisdom through self-realization. The essays included in this book are:-1: The Trinity of Knowledge2: The Soul of Knowledge3: Truths of Life Are neither Black nor White4: Simple Living- High Thinking5: The Mystery of Creativity6: Imagination is the Mother of Knowledge7: The Seven Pillars of Creativity8: As is the Mind of Society, So is the Mind of Man9: Commonsense- Discover the Genius within You10: Four Methods to Understand the World11: Four Steps to Know a Person Completely12: Words Are Nothing: Meaning is Everything13: Discard Guru for Learning True Knowledge14: Why Inaction is Sometimes Better than Action?15: If You Care for Image, You Can’t Care for Truth16: From One Deception to Another17: Life is like a Game of Cards18: Life is Just a Game: Don’t Lose Heart, Be Sporting19: Life is A Song: Understand Its Mystery and Enjoy Life20: Living Happily in an Imperfect World21: The Greatest Selling Fallacy of this World22: If it is not free, It is of no Value23: The Illusion of Maya24: Secret is the Mystery of Sacredness25: The Lies of Arts26: The Universal Cycle of Wisdom27: One who Knows, Knows Not28: The Dangerous Cocktail of Truth and Fiction29: Rule of the Feminine30: Wish to Solve Your Problems Effortlessly: Follow the Feminine Way"

        "From the Author",
        "We are living in the knowledge era. We spend years inschools and colleges to acquire knowledge. The present generation is certainlythe most educated one, where being a graduate has become commonplace. Evenafter the completion of formal education, we never stop learning as knowledgehas become so easily and economically accessible to us via internet, books,newspapers, news channels and social media.Everyone is sharing the knowledge freely with us so liberally that todaywe seem to have an overdose of knowledge.Yet all the knowledge of the world has failed to solve ourproblems of life. The present world is not only the most knowledgeable but alsothe unhappiest.  We have knowledge but wedon't know how to use it properly to solve our real-life problems and lead abetter life. We have solutions to all the problems of the world as parrotedfrom the experts but hardly any solution of our own problems.  The essays of thisbook 'From Knowledge to Wisdom' attempt to invoke intuition in the readers toexplain complete knowledge by association of the opposites and by connectingthe known with the unknown.  Mostknowledgeable people often know only the half-truth which is communicated tothem by the organizations that are sponsoring such knowledge to serve their owninterest. The other half of the knowledge is always hidden from our eyes asthat does not sell but we gather it from life.It is my attempt to reveal the complete truth to the readersso that they can assimilate the complete knowledge and make it alive usingtheir intuition that leads to self-realization and wisdom.  Once the seeds of wisdom are sown in ourmind, they grow naturally and gradually we develop the ability to learn byourselves.  I earnestly hope that theessays of this book shall be useful to the readers to lead a happier andsuccessful life.",
