        "The selection process for the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New York, has been the same for sixty years. Two sets of electors are used, both of which vote each year using subjective criteria that inevitably cause errors of selection and omission. One group, the Baseball Writers Association of America, votes by mail using a pre-selected list of retired players that meet eligibility requirements. The second group of electors is the Veterans Committee, comprised of former players who are Hall of Fame members plus retired baseball executives and sportswriters who meet in Florida during spring training and base their votes on the merits of candidates no longer eligible for the BBWAA ballot. In this work the author combines an irreverent critique of the voting process with an analysis of the biases that have fostered questionable choices in Hall of Fame voting. The result is a comprehensive, statistically founded survey of the factors which influence election."

        "At the Baseball Hall of Fame's 2001 induction ceremonies, one of the inductees was unable to deliver his speech through his tears, suggesting how important being elected to the hall is to the players. One would hope that the selection process was as pristine as the honor itself. Not so, according to Vail, a member of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), who describes a process that has undergone frequent change and chronicles the oversights that may have resulted from the selectors' sliding scale. Baseball guru Bill James explored the same issues in",
        "The Politics of Glory",
        "(1994), but James focused on human bias and institutional incompetence; Vail examines the voting patterns. Particularly interesting are the contradictory positions of the Baseball Writers of America, who have the first vote, and the Veterans' Committee, which ostensibly corrects the writers' oversights. Vail's information is clear and objective, and the presentation is enlivened with dry humor. Amateur baseball historians will devour this eye-opening account, which should add fuel to an already fiery debate.",
