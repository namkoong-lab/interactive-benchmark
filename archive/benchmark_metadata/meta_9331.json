        "Hunter, a writer/stylist who specializes in design, provides a look at contemporary Southwest style, which goes beyond the pastel Native American design previously popular to include a mixture of Spanish, Mexican, and cowboy influences, and shows how to the look has been incorporated into home decor. First an overview is given of the region and the traditional architectural styles and details that comprise the Southwest style. Then homes in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah are depicted that exemplify each region's style from mountain to desert. Recommended for large interior design collections and where there is an interest. Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc."
