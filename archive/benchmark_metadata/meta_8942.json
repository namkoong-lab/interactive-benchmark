        "\"Author Bill O'Neill has authored many books on Trivia and has become an expert in this field! His topics include movies, football, baseball, wars, rock music, simply random trivia facts and now States. This volume is American trivia (a subset that grows broader by the hour these days!). To set the mood of this eighth volume (NEW YORK, TEXAS, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, ALASKA, OHIO and HAWAII were the first) on PENNSYLVANIA, Bill states, 'How much do you know about Pennsylvania? Sure, you know it's located in the Northeast, but what else do you really know about the state? Do you know why it is called Pennsylvania? Do you know how the state earned its nickname \"The Keystone State?\"...you've heard of Philly cheese steaks...the Hershey chocolate factory....' And with these challenges to our knowledge, Bill presents answers and a fascinating collection of facts and trivia all referencing Pennsylvania.  This book is broken up into easy to follow chapters that will help you learn more about this famous state. The book is divided into fascinating sections - Pennsylvania's history and random facts, Pennsylvania's Pop culture and sports, Pennsylvania's inventions, ideas and more, Pennsylvania's attractions and sports, Pennsylvania's unsolved mysteries, urban legends and other weird facts (such as Bigfoot, witch trials, the famous haunted prison!), and each section is accompanied by a test - just to make sure we are retaining all the trivia that Bill O'Neill shares!  Not only is the book entertaining - it is also very instructive for every reader. Have fun, learn, and be ready for the next gathering of very smart friends! You'll be on top.\" by Grady Harp  -----  \"I liked reading this book because even though I have visited the state of PA before in the past, I learned some new facts that I did not know before. Some of the interesting information that is mentioned in this book by the author of the book includes the following information: The oldest bookshop is in the United States is in PA and it is named the Monrovian Bookshop which was founded in 1745. Ricketts Glen State Park is one of the most popular state parks in PA with 13,050 acres of land and 24 named waterfalls. Although the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles football teams are football rivals, they actually played together as a single team during World War II. The single team was called the Steagles. PA is home to 11 minor league baseball teams and eight of those 11 teams are affiliated with Major League Baseball teams. Former San Francisco 49ers football player Joe Montana almost took a completely different sports career path into basketball.\" by William  -----  \"Definitely read this book to find out who was whom in Pennsylvania that influenced world events. A suggested minor Addition about the Amish is that they were the first people to utilize wind turbines, and use a combination of wind and solar. They use wind turbines to pump ground water up to storage tanks giving them a water source when the wind stops blowing. They use a combination of wind and solar to dry clothes on an old fashioned clothes line!!\" by Jeedgr  -----  \"As with all Bill O'Neill's books, you can learn a tremendous amount about a topic in a fun, interesting and informative way. I thoroughly recommend this most enjoyable book.\" by Lucy"
