        "About the Author",
        "Rio Lowry has dreamed of becoming an author since he was a child. He grew up in a small town in southern Alberta where he developed a love for reading. He loved it so much that sometimes his parents would ground him from reading so that he would actually get his chores done! He now lives back in his hometown with his wife and children. When he is not planning a story Rio can be found devouring a good book (fantasy and science fiction are his favorites), creating computer programs or hanging out with his awesome family.",
