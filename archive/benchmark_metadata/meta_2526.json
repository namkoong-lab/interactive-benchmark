        "“There is always a way.”",
        "Kelnaht, Taruif, and Ianys are meant to be together, but old promises and the decree of the elders prevent them from claiming each other openly at Solstice. Kelnaht can investigate murder and foul play, but he can’t see how he can keep both his lovers without breaking the rules. But if he believes in the guide’s words and trusts his faith in Ma’terra, they will find a way to clear the fog and puddles from their paths.",
        "The Forester",
        "Kelnaht, a cloud elf, is a truth seeker caught between love and faith, when a murder reveals an illicit affair between two tree elves he desires more than he can admit. Kelnaht’s former lover Ianys once betrayed him, and the shunned forester Taruif is not allowed to talk to anyone but the guide, their spiritual pathfinder.",
        "Lost and Found",
        "A stripling goes missing from the tribe, and heavy rainfall hides all traces of his whereabouts. With days creeping by without a lead, it’s hard to keep the tribe’s spirits up, more so when Kelnaht’s own future depends on the elders. Taruif has been shunned for almost twenty turns, but now that a possible forester’s apprentice is coming of age, the elders consider reducing his sentence. Taruif could be set free.",

Then a wounded traveller is found in the forest, left to die after a vicious attack.___________________________wordcount: 95,000 wordsTALES OF THE FOREST is an ongoing series of standalone stories linked by a forest world.Content notes are available in the book's front matter and on the author's website."

        "Kassa at Three am (Act One)",
        "\"The Forester is an impressive mix of fantasy and murder/mystery. The writing is superior and the romance is a nice touch without being too easy and ignoring the many potential problems. ... I found this short story/novella very entertaining, interesting, and satisfying. I didn't want it to end and quite literally didn't put it down from beginning to end. \"",
        "Jay at Joyfully Jay Reviews (Act Two)",
        "\"",
        "Arden manages to blend so many genres in an unusual way. We have the menage and the fantasy, and overlaid on top is a really great mystery and investigation plot. ...",
        "Arden not only gives us a really creative world with lots of richness and depth, but she also brings us into it so easily. \"",

Arden is an EPIC Award-winning author of Romantic Speculative Fiction and Suspense who sings her way through life in platform boots.', 'For most of her sheltered youth, Blaine read, daydreamed, and made up stories. As she grew up, she slowly transitioned from telling them to her favourite doll and acting them out with her Barbies, to putting pen to paper. Her motto is *Our Difference is our Strength*, and her stories are often set in worlds where gender fluidity and sexual diversity are woven into the bare bones of society.', 'When not writing or reading, Blaine has singing lessons and hopes to be in a band someday.']}"
