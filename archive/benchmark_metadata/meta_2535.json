        "Three delightful angels come down to earth—just in time for Christmas!",
        "Shirley, Goodness and Mercy: three well-intentioned angels who are occasionally allowed to intervene (or—perhaps more accurately—interfere!) in human affairs. Despite their frequent misadventures, despite the chaos they often cause, things always seem to turn out right.Their latest prayer request comes from the Seattle area. Anne Fletcher sees her son, Roy, becoming a bitter, career-obsessed man. She prays for a special woman to be sent into Roy's life, a woman who'll show him what really matters.The angels swoop down and find a way to throw Julie Wilcoff in his path—literally! From that moment on, Shirley, Goodness and Mercy shall follow them…whispering suggestions, arranging encounters, hoping for the best."
