They can replace conventional fasteners such as screws, clips, rivets, snaps, hook and loop and bolts in many applications where access or repositioning is needed. Used to attach doors, access panels, signs, cushions, wall headliners, display components, city bus light fixtures, ceiling attachment, privacy curtain rails, sunroof trims, and wall panels. Also for POP (point of purchase), trade show exhibition and electronics, and for attaching E-ZPass tags to car windshields.",
        "Dual lock only has one type of side; unlike velcro where there are a separate hook and a loop side; so rolls are typically cut in half and then mated or connected so a 10-foot roll would be used as two 5-foot strips. Made in the U.S."
