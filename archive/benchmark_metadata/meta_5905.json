    "description": [
        "Clean fuel is important because there are small jets and passages in the carburetor and opening in a fuel injector. The fuel filter is responsible for keeping the smaller contaminants in the system out of the engine and other fuel delivery components. On carbureted engines these contaminants can cause clogging of orifices or jets and cause the vehicle to get too much or not enough fuel."
