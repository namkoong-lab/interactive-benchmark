        "Breakfast is a cute and colorful character, a cheeky sheep who loves to do lots of fun and active things. But Breakfast is a little bit fussy. Yes, Breakfast only likes to do things that start with the letter B. Join Breakfast as she imagines lots and lots of “B” activities to try to decide which one she wants to do all day.A great book to encourage literacy development skills, being rich in rhyme, rhythm, and alliteration, and by facilitating letter sound connections and opportunities for prediction."
