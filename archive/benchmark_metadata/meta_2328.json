        "This sometimes depressing novel about late-nineteenth-century labor problems in France focuses on the coal mineÐa life of dangerous work, starvation wages, impoverished futures. A newcomer to the labor force attempts improvement through worker resistance, including a strike with unforseen and tragic consequences. Few readers of audiobooks can match Frederick Davidson's remarkable skill, and he needs all of it to cope with French pronunciations and divergent conversations, which require him to distinguish among many characters. Happily, he's equal to the task, rendering this complex, yet worthwhile, novel accessible to all listeners. T.H. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine",

        "À Montsou, dix mille mineurs gémissent sous le poids d'une exploitation toujours plus forte ; parmi eux, Étienne Lantier, qui voudrait voir triompher ses idéaux socialistes. Quand la grève éclate, il en devient le chef, guidant les revendications des ouvriers, les incitant à la fermeté. Bientôt le coron est à court de pain, et la rébellion se durcit¿ Germinal, animé par un souffle épique, est le grand roman du peuple et de la révolte. Ainsi que l'écrivait Jules Lemaitre en 1885 : «M. Zola a magnifiquement rendu ce qu'il y a de fatal, d'aveugle, d'impersonnel, d'irrésistible dans un drame de cette sorte, la contagion des colères rassemblées, l'âme collective des foules, violente et aisément furieuse¿»",

        "\"Superb.\"--Professor James Chastain, Ohio University \"This is far and away the best English translation of Germinal currently available. The translator has captured the nineteenth century flavor of the original without sacrificing clarity or meaning. The introduction and notes are excellent and the map of Montsou and vicinity is a stroke of genius.\" --Professor Richard Cumming, University of Utah",

        "?mile Zola was a French writer who is recognized as an exemplar of literary naturalism and for his contributions to the development of theatrical naturalism. Zola s best-known literary works include the twenty-volume Les Rougon-Macquart, an epic work that examined the influences of violence, alcohol and prostitution on French society through the experiences of two families, the Rougons and the Macquarts. Other remarkable works by Zola include Contes ? Ninon, Les Myst?res de Marseille, and Th?r?se Raquin.",
        "In addition to his literary contributions, Zola played a key role in the Dreyfus Affair of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. His newspaper article J Accuse accused the highest levels of the French military and government of obstruction of justice and anti-semitism, for which he was convicted of libel in 1898. After a brief period of exile in England, Zola returned to France where he died in 1902. ?mile Zola is buried in the Panth?on alongside other esteemed literary figures Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas.",

        "Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic's introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman's uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.",
