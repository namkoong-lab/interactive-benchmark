        "Leadership has long been seen as one of the most vital and influential factors in both social and organisational development. It is believed to play a central part in how humans interact and collaborate. But where do these beliefs come from and how do they affect us?",
        "These are a few questions that have occupied C.C. Monö’s mind since 2007. After spending several years exploring the leadership industry and its effect on people and societies, C.C. Monö first had the idea for the Eagle King’s Academy series while giving a guest lecture on followership at Linköping University.",
        "After that, the idea slowly grew in his mind for nine months. Then, in July 2014, while on holiday in Borneo, he presented a simple outline of The Academy to his wife, Cindy. To his surprise, she loved it and so he began sketching on his synopsis.",
        "Don’t miss the second book in the series - The Box: Puppets & Puppeteers."
