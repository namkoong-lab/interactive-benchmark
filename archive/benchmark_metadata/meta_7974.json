An undergraduate and a graduate scholarship in her name have been established by former students, one a professor of surgical oncology in Little Rock, Arkansas; the other, co-owner of an international antiques business in Dallas.', 'The author of many reviews, essays, and articles for national and international publications and a regular contributor to Stagebill (with Internet redistribution), Professor Comini has published eight books, of which one, Egon Schiele’s Portraits (l974, reissued in paperback, l990 and 2014), was nominated for the National Book Award and received the College Art Association’s Charles Rufus Morey Book Award. Her other books are: Schiele in Prison (l973), Gustav Klimt (l975, with French, German, and Dutch editions; reissued l986, 1990, 1994, 2001), Egon Schiele (l976, with Italian, French, German, and Dutch editions; reissued l986, 1994, 2001), The Fantastic Art of Vienna (l978), The Changing Image of Beethoven: A Study in Mythmaking (l987; reissued in paperback with a new preface in 2008), and Egon Schiele Nudes (1994). She contributed the chapter on Scandinavian artists to the l990 book World Impressionism, essays for the Washington National Gallery’s l992 catalogue and exhibition of Käthe Kollwitz (German edition, 1993) and 1994 catalogue and traveling exhibition of Egon Schiele. as well as an eponymous essay for the 1994 book on La Traviata, Violetta and Her Sisters and one for the 1996 English National Opera booklet, Salome. A major essay on the visual Wagner appears in the 1997 book The Threat to the Cosmos, two on Mahler in Muziek & Wetenschap, 1996 and in Gustav Mahler et l’ironie, 2001, and one on Beethoven in Beethoven and His World, 2000, as well as one on allegory in Klimt und die Frauen, 2000 (English edition, 2000). The Cleveland Psychoanalytic Society commissioned a lecture “Toys in Freud’s Attic” for 2000, published in Between Rousseau and Freud in 2002, and the Santa Fe Opera commissioned special lectures from her for six consecutive years from 1997 through 2002 (and again in 2006), as has the Dallas Symphony Orchestra for the years 2000 through 2006, and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra for 2007. In the fall of 2007 she lectured on Sibelius and Mahler in London and on Klimt and Mahler at the Neue Galerie in New York. where she also spoke on Schönberg in 2010 and on Expressionism, “The Decisive Decade,” in 2011. In 2014 she spoke at the Dallas Museum of Art’s symposium on the Wittgenstein/Czeschka vitrine.', 'A featured speaker at the Leipzig Gewandhaus Symposia under conductor Kurt Masur during the 1970s and 1980s, Professor Comini, who is also an amateur flutist, has participated in many congresses and symposia from Helsinki, Stockholm, Amsterdam, London, Dublin, and Oxford to Montpellier, Hamburg, Graz, Vienna, Budapest, and St. Petersburg in her special field of musical iconography. In recognition of her contributions to Germanic culture she was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honor in l990 by the Republic of Austria. Her lively revisionist work in the history of women artists was acknowledged in 1995 by the Women\\'s Caucus for Art with the coveted Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2002 she was nominated for the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame, Arts Category, and in 2003 she was awarded the Phi Beta Kappa Gamma of Texas Laurence Perrine Prize for Teaching and Scholarship. In 2005 SMU’s Meadows School of the Arts established and named an annual Comini Lecture Series in her honor. In 2010 she was awarded a medal by the Veteran Feminists of America. In 2011 she participated in the Chicago International Beethoven Festival and in New York was given the \"Distinguished Alumna Award\" by her alma mater, Barnard College. In 2012 an exhibition and international symposium, “Alessandra Comini und Neulengbach,” was given in her honor, marking fifty years since her discovery of the prison cell in which Schiele was incarcerated. New York’s Neue Galerie Museum asked her to curate the exhibition that opened in the fall of 2014 on Egon Schiele’s Portraits, coinciding with when she turned eighty, hence coming full circle in her work on that artist.', 'Her last illustrated book, an “art history autobiography” entitled In Passionate Pursuit—A Memoir, (2004) was commissioned by the legendary New York publisher George Braziller and favorably reviewed in The Christian Science Monitor and Booklist, which characterized it as an “erudite self-portrait [that] charts the making of an art historian and professional ‘seer,’ whose passion and wit enabled her to become a noted teacher and scholar.” Her first two murder mysteries, Killing for Klimt, and The Schiele Slaughters were published in 2014 and 2015 and are part of the Megan Crespi series. Coming next are The Kokoschka Capers and The Mahler Murders.']}"
