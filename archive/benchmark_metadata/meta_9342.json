        "About the Author",
        "After graduating with a degree in business mathematics from Technische Universität Berlin, Germany, Dirk Herzog started his career in 1996 in the CO-OM development department at SAP in Walldorf, Germany. His work focused on cost-center planning and the CO planning processor. Four years later, he moved back to Berlin to join the BW consulting team at SAP Deutschland. Since then, he has led numerous national and international implementations of Business Intelligence (BI) and Strategic Enterprise Management (SEM). These included the world's first SAP BW 3.0 project, one of the first cube-based SEM-BCS implementations, and a large International Accounting Standards (IAS) project in the banking sector. Dirk also has developed solutions and solution concepts for complex modeling and implementation. He is co-author of the PDEBWB course on \"User Exits in SAP BW,\" and has taught the course several times. Whenever he has the time, Dirk writes Web logs in the SAP Developer Network (SDN) and answers forum questions."
