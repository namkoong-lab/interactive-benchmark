        "About the Author",
        "In 1955 Dr. Theodore Papaloizos was teaching the Modern Greek language to his students at St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Church, just as he had done for years. However, he felt that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find Greek language books that struck the delicate balance between thorough content and easy-to-follow methods. He chose to resolve the issue by writing in his free time. He released his first book two years later (in 1957). With positive feedback from students and colleagues, Dr. Papaloizos kept writing. Now, more than 50 years later, Papaloizos Publications continues to publish instructional materials in print, on DVD, on CD, and on CD-Rom with a library of more than 100 titles. Papaloizos Publications top priority remains educating hundreds-of-thousands of students around the globe."
