        "The hottest, hippest nightclub in town, Wonderland is where every boy’s dreams come true. Where the DJ, Hatter, spins the maddest tracks, the Caterpillar sells the trippiest drugs, and the Queen of Hearts sends every drag diva off with her head. Still, Alex can’t stop thinking about Steven—even while being seduced by a pair of twinks who are tweedlehot and tweedlehotter. Things only get weirder when Alex learns that Steven is missing—and an anonymous phone call warns him that he’ll never see Steven again…unless he eats this, drinks that, and dives deeper down the rabbit hole of decadence.
