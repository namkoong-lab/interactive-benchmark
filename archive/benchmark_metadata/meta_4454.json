        "Over the years, both customer needs and technology have changed. The Swiss Army Knife has evolved by responding to these needs, while remaining an essential tool our clients can rely on. That's our story. But it's not what turned the Victorinox Knife into an icon. It's about the stories our customers experienced in which our products played a vital role: stories about memorable moments of adventure and expeditions on earth, in the sky and in space. Dramatic stories in which our products contributed to solutions and saved lives. Even stories of prominent encounters where our knives opened doors, helping to create ties between politicians, opinion leaders and nations. In all of these stories it becomes clear that thanks to the talent of our employees we have been able to develop products that excel in their functionality, quality and design - making them true companions for life. We invite you to discover the world of Victorinox and are proud to be a companion for your life. Thank you for your interest and trust in Victorinox."
