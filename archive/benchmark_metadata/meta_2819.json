        "SUCCESS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY, IT’S ABOUT PEOPLE",
        "Raised in a working-class home as an only child and doted on by parents and grandparents, Mike Leven learned about both work ethic and ethical living. Through a long career, he was exposed to discrimination, corruption, and bad decisions that ruined people’s lives, as well as great humanitarian efforts, acts of kindness, and mentorship. All of these experiences shaped who he became as a business leader, husband, father, and community member.Over the course of sixty years, Mike directed the marketing and operations of several companies, moving his way up the chain from barely making ends meet to being his own boss. What Mike learned is that success is not about winning but about how you play the game. This is how Mike Leven played the game."

        "From the Back Cover",
        "“Why do you work so hard?” someone once asked Mike Leven. The answer was twofold. First, he had always felt a responsibility to do his job to the best of his ability, but also, he was sincerely interested in his work and the people he encountered there. This was because his understanding of business was not about numbers, hierarchies, and the bottom line; it was about people.“There is a reason Mike has received pretty much every lifetime achievement award given in the hospitality industry and why whenever anyone who knows him comes to town, they make it a point to stop by. Treasure this book―Mike is truly one of a kind and has my highest respect.”―Kenneth R. Greger, partner, August Leadership, LLC“In these troubling times, Mike’s approach to leadership and to life is refreshing, authentic, and rewarding.”―S. Kirk Kinsell, former CEO, IHG Americas“This book is a true inspiration, full of real-life lessons Mike has recorded for those who want to use it as a guide and resource to navigate their own life as ‘compassionate leaders’ for the betterment of humanity.”―H. P. Rama, chairman of the board, Auro Hotels",
