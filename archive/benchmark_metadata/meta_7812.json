        "While on a trip to a nearby department store, the author got the idea for this story by watching the scene of his very young daughter choose a toy bunny from a box full of bunnies. The choice of a plain bunny over fancy bunnies gave him the idea of writing the tale from the viewpoint of the toy as if even the most plain of bunnies deserves a loving home."
