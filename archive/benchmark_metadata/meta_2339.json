        "McGoldrick (The Promise) explores Georgian Ireland in this latest offering, which features the extensive historical detail for which the husband-and-wife team is known. Sir Nicholas Spencer, an English philanthropist, decides that he needs to settle down if he's going to open a house for homeless children. Determined to select a wife quickly, he heads for Ireland to meet Clara Purefoy, the demure daughter of an English lord. Arriving in Cork, however, he stumbles upon a band of Shanavests, Irish peasants who oppose the oppressive English government. The leader of the band, Nicholas discovers to his surprise, is Jane Purefoy, the disgraced elder daughter of the Purefoy family. Captivated by the stunning rebel, Nicholas agrees to keep her secret. Now he must extricate himself from a relationship with Clara as well as unravel the mystery of why Jane's family holds her in such disdain. The historical detail here can be heavy-handed at times, as when McGoldrick introduces Dr. Samuel Johnson (\"a man who is perhaps the leading light of English letters today\") in a clumsy aside. The plot occasionally feels contrived, as well, but the story's strong pacing, likeable hero and heroine and surprising twists and turns compensate for these minor flaws.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.",

        "The Irish rebel Egan and his band have been a thorn in the side of the British Crown for years, but something goes dreadfully wrong on their latest mission. Englishman Sir Nicholas Spencer, who is traveling from London to stay with the Purefoy family and their lovely young daughter, Clara, captures the rebel leader after encountering the group robbing a British bishop and his entourage; then, before Egan slips out of his grasp, Nicholas briefly unmasks the Irish rebel and discovers that Egan is a woman. An even greater surprise lies in store for Nicholas once he arrives at the Purefoy estate and meets Clara's older sister, Jane, a spirited beauty who looks remarkably like the masked woman he was struggling with earlier that day. Skillfully blending history and romance, McGoldrick borrows the hero's best friend from her previous book,",
