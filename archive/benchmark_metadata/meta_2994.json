        "For each of us there are times when life seems to fall apart. This may occur gradually or with an unexpected suddenness. At such times, we may realize that we have reached a pivotal moment in life when we can no longer avoid the soul’s call. We know there is something more at hand—something more meaningful and possible for our life.",
        "That’s how it was for me. More than once I found myself confronting such a life transition. I searched for guidance from the usual people— psychologists, physicians, and others. They were of little help. I then turned to the great stories of transition that have been told and retold throughout history. It was there that I found an authentic, precise, and reliable roadmap for successfully navigating a life transition, transforming seeming adversity into a more fulfilled life.",

        "An understanding of each of these stages enabled me to confidently move forward towards a revitalized life. I wish to share this practical wisdom and guidance with you, along with supportive advice and practices. I know you can rely upon, as did I, the guidance of a clear and well traveled path through the darkness to a more authentic life of soul and spirit."
