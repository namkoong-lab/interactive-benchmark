Creative writing has always been a passion but it is only since other occupations have given him the freedom that he has been able to take it to the next level.', \"Andrew Dambe is a pseudonym - derived from his middle name and his mother's maiden name. He maintains that his real name is too long and unwieldy to inflict on anyone looking for a good read.\"]}"
