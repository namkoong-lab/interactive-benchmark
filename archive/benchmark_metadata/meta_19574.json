        "Directed by Joan Chen from an award-winning novella banned in China because of political and sexual content, \"Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl\" is a powerful love story. Between 1967 and 1976, nearly 8 million Chinese youths were \"sent down\" for specialized training to the remotest corners of the country. Before being sent down, the young and beautiful Xiu Xiu dreams of becoming a horse trainer in the wide open plains of Tibet, far away from her busy city home. Her journey begins in a training camp in the isolated plains with a solitary and mysterious man. Slowly, Xiu Xiu discovers that she is unlikely to ever see her home again without a wealthy sponsor. Her world becomes a horrifying cage, where \"patrons\" promise her escape in exchange for her sexual compromise. This is one girl's story and a compassionate deed that inspired one special man and everyone who hears her tale."
