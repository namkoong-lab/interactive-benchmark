        "Sterling Silver History",
        "Originating in Europe in the 12th century, sterling silver has been a source of value for everything from table settings to currency for centuries. Sterling silver is a soft metal, yet when combined with copper, produces a tough material that could be heavily relied on. Due to these qualities it is the perfect material to mold into intricate jewelry designs, giving a luxurious look at an affordable price.",
        "Sterling Silver Composition",
        "Sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper at a ratio of 92.5 percent silver to 7.5 percent copper to maintain its durability without harming its sparkle.",
        "Sterling Silver Care",
        "Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals. To avoid scratches, store in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish. Upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polishing cloth."
