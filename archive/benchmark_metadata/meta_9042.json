        "This quote from my poem “Skyward Bound”—“No where have I been, but everywhere in my dreams” — is the genesis of this book, evolving within the dream state. The reader may see this work as part of my life story, which is slightly true. The anger, sadness, and regret felt in a difficult relationship is all too familiar to me, and many others. Perhaps a few poems herein will remind people of the importance of forgiveness and hope in salvaging a relationship that gets off to a bad start in the early years."

        "About the Author",
        "Linda Moore Ellwood has been writing for many years, but only sporadically. She obtained a B.A degree from University of Colorado and an M.A. from University of Northern Colorado, taught for several years at high school and Central Michigan Uni-versity. From there, she moved to New York City, intrigued by Wall Street and life in the city, but the madness of firm she worked with contributed to her returning to Colorado, and then to Napa, California. She sold real estate for a year, opened her own mortgage company, and raised her youngest daughter. It was only after her daughter graduated from college that she began to write again, mostly short stories and poetry. To date she has published several poems in chapbooks, won 1st and 2nd Place in the Jessamyn West Poetry Contest at Napa Valley College, and 2nd Place in a contest sponsored by Voices of Lincoln in 2014."
