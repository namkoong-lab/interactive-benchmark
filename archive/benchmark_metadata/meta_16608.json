        "Outdoor activities just got even better—Columbia Youth Sandy Shore Printed Long Sleeve Sunguard has all the protection and comfort your little one need for sunny day playdates. Columbia is renowned for our quality material and proprietary technology featured in our youth apparel and this long sleeve is an example of that. This long sleeve features our signature wicking fabric for ultimate moisture management during activity-driven days. The unique technology quickly moves moisture from the skin into the fabric where it spreads across the surface to quickly evaporate—keeping your little one cool and their clothing dry and comfortable. The UPF 50 sun protection blocks UVA and UVB rays to help prevent sunburns and long-term skin damage. The tight weave construction with UV absorbent yarns block the full spectrum of harmful UV rays. The crew neck and all-way stretch fit make all-day wear and movement comfortable. Our signature logo is featured on the sleeve for subtle style. Whether your little one wears this layer alone or with other layers, they'll remain protected and comfortable. Columbia's youth sun guard comes in many sizes and colors. To ensure the size you choose is right, utilize our sizing chart and the following measurement instructions: For the sleeves, start at the center back of your neck and measure across the shoulder and down to the end of the sleeve. If you come up with a partial number, round up to the next even number. For the chest, measure at the fullest part of the chest, under the armpits and over the shoulder blades, keeping the tape measure firm and level."
