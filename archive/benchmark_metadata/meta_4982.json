        "THIS IS A BLOCK OF 6 STAMPS AS PICTURED. ~ On April 25, 1962 in Seattle WA; the USPS celebrated the 1962 World's Fair held in Seattle Washington. Depicted on the stamp is Space Needle and Monorail, both built for the 1962 World's Fair. During which time nearly 20,000 people a day used the elevators of the Space Needle, with over 2.3 million visitors in all for the World Fair. The Space Needle is 605 feet high at its highest point and 138 feet wide at its widest point and weighs 9,550 tons. When it was completed, it was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River. It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude. The tower also has 25 lightning rods on its roof to prevent lightning damage. For decades, the \"hovering disk\" of the Space Needle was home to two restaurants 500 feet above the ground: the Space Needle Restaurant, which was originally named Eye of the Needle, and Emerald Suite. It rotates 360 degrees in exactly forty-seven minutes The architecture of the Space Needle is the result of a compromise between designs of two architects, Edward E. Carlson and John Graham."
