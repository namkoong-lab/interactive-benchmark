        "The Australian Shepherd Judging Compendium, An Illustrated Workbook for judges and non-judges alike by the award-winning author, of All About Aussies: The Australian Shepherd From A to Z. “The Australian Shepherd, Judging Compendium” by Jeanne Joy Hartnagle-Taylor is an illustrated workbook that reviews not only the breed standard and how it is interpreted but illustrates the breed standard with text and carefully selected pictures that help the reader see the importance of each trait as it is discussed. The Compendium begins with a review of breed history as a herding breed to modern day usage. This workbook also provides the reader with good insight and understanding of why structure and gait are important to its function. Each chapter explains a section of the breed standard followed by a quiz that is used to make the reader think.The text is easy to read and carefully written with a good analysis of unique traits that are described in the breed standard. The illustrations of each trait give the reader good insight into why the breed standard requires certain body proportions and what is considered correct breed type, movement and character. The Compendium makes clear that herding sheep, cattle and other animals requires strong herding and guardian instincts coupled with versatile skills which are required of a dog that must be easy to train. All of these traits are carefully described.I would recommend this judging compendium to anyone who is seriously interested in a better understanding of the Australian Shepherd breed. - Dr. Carmen L.

        "by Jeanne Joy Hartnagle-Taylor is an illustrated workbook that reviews not only the breed standard and how it is interpreted but illustrates the breed standard with text and carefully selected pictures that help the reader see the importance of each trait as it is discussed. The Compendium  begins with a review of breed history as a herding breed to modern day usage. This workbook also provides the reader with good insight and understanding of why structure and gait are important to its function. Each chapter explains a section of the breed standard followed by a quiz that is used to make the reader think. The text is easy to read and carefully written with a good analysis of unique traits that are described in the breed standard. The illustrations of each trait give the reader good insight into why the breed standard requires certain body proportions and what is considered correct breed type, movement and character.  The Compendium makes clear that herding sheep, cattle and other animals requires strong herding and guardian instincts coupled with versatile skills which are required of a dog that must be easy to train. All of these traits are carefully described. I would recommend this judging compendium to anyone who is seriously interested in a better understanding of the Australian Shepherd breed. - Dr. Carmen L.Battaglia, a highly respected AKC Judge, author, lecturer and world-renowned canine expert.Jeanne Joy Hartnagle is \"probably the most recognized authority on breed history\" - Show Dog: The Charmed Life and Trying Times of a Near-Perfect Purebred by Josh Dean \"Few people have better perspective than Jeanne Joy Hartnagle who, as the breed's de facto historian, has watched Aussies change over the past half century.\" - Josh DeanLet's Talk Books - by Narelle Hammond for Canine Construction and ConformationThis workbook written and illustrated by Jeanne Joy Hartnagle-Taylor provides the enthusiast, breeder, and judge an excellent analysis of the unique qualities of this delightful breed.In an easy read workbook format, not only do the illustrations an text of each trait give the reader an insight into why the breed standard is what it is, but it also delves into what is considered correct breed type, movement, and hallmarks of the breed.Each part of the breed standard comes with a test/quiz section to further understand this breed by testing your general knowledge of anatomy etc. as well as your understanding of the breed standard.Jeanne Joy Hartnagle-Taylor comments that her intent of the workbook is to help judges and non-judges gain a better understanding and appreciation of the qualities that make the Australian Shepherd unique from all other breeds.I was delighted to receive this book from the author and my only comment to Jeanne was that I would have liked to see an explanation as to \"why the name?\" Mainly for those that are under the impression that the breed was developed \"down under!\"By Kristin Tara Horowitz",

        "is unlike other efforts that have come before it to explain the breed standard, terms,and locomotion mechanics. Australian Shepherd specific,",
        "Compendium",
        "takes the academic and blends with the practical.As someone who was raised in the show Aussie world first, I know that a lot of times, the explanation of what is ideal is generalized without practical knowledge. Phrases like \"can trot all day\" stick with you and create an emphasis on show ring gaiting - and specifically ground covering stride with as much reach and drive as is possible becoming an ideal. She turns that idea on its head: \"An Australian Shepherd with a sound, balanced trot should translate into an Aussie that can outmaneuver livestock. The trotting style is not choppy or stilted, but not long and flowing either. The trotting style is moderate. It has to be\" (83).From my own experience really testing my dogs, I've seen that what might win in the breed ring isn't necessarily what allows a dog to live into its old age still sound and enthusiastic about doing its job - I think this is truly the main message Hartnagle-Taylor wishes to convey.It has been a journey of education for me, and she's hoping to short cut that for others.",
        "It starts with the choice of photos and illustrations: many of the images are familiar to you if you're a reader of her prior works and she's chosen mainly older photos for a reason - rather than embracing the progression of the breed in the show ring or what is in favor for the Aussie type today, she wants to emphasize what the early dogs looked like and why that remains an ideal. Her choice of visuals will set in mind for many what an ideal, functional Aussie looks like. Rather than focusing heavily on what's seen in the show ring, she uses almost no stacked photos to illustrate points, choosing a variety of types to illustrate her points, and lots and lots of movement (and I don't mean flying trots) shots to emphasize her explanations. You will see dogs flying through the air, confronting cattle, and dipping low to heel -and you'll understand what the mechanism is involved to allow them to do that. There is NO other book out there that I know of that does this.She compares the ASCA and AKC breed standard and pulls no punches when it comes to how the two standards deviate and what the effect on the dog can and is becoming because of it. You'll understand why word choice makes a difference and why choosing to fault something or not is important.For non-judges or those without a lot of hands on experience, there is SO much here to learn and she makes it easy to see in your own dogs.You'll connect to the historical dogs she mentions while seeing things in your own dog and deepening your understanding of the form that follows the function.She has quizzes at the end of each chapter that are not simply intended to test what you learned, but make you stretch and truly process what you're learning, asking questions. Because of this, I hope that it becomes a standard used for judging clinics as it fosters great discussion and deeper thinking.",
        "Because many of us are not going to see an Aussie working practically on a ranch. Much of what's described in the book isn't something you can see from watching a dog at at trial, even on cattle. It isn't until you really have to test your dog with miles on uneven and challenging terrain that you truly know what you have. It is so easy to live in a self-imposed bubble of what is correct because everyone around you thinks it is. It's my deepest hope that this book challenges people with those ideas to either find opportunities to see this in real life or trust in those opinions that have walked the walk.This is a document that should be in every serious Aussie person's library. We are fortunate to have it.",
        "From the Author",
        "It's problematic when people interpret the standard in such a way it results in Australian Shepherds who no longer possess the kind of agility to perform their historical function. Curtis Brown said something to the effect, \"The standard should be interpreted to mean the written description should , the one interpreting it must have an intimate knowledge of the breed's characteristics. The same words in different standards have different meanings.\"",
