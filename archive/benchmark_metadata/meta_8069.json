        "This strong text introduces students to basic accounting concepts, excites them by using lots of real world examples (both U.S. and international), provides them with some basic accounting knowledge, and then shows them how accounting is used and analyzed in actual case situations. This book does not take an encyclopedic approach to every possible nuance of financial statement preparation or alternative way to perform accounting functions since students who desire that level of detail will find it in more advanced classes."
