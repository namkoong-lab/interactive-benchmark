        "How to diamond paint?  1. Unroll the canvas and spread it down onto a flat surface, then secure the edges with masking tape.  2. Peel back part of the plastic sheet covered on the canvas. Do not peel the entire plastic sheet away, or the adhesive on the canvas will get dirty and lose its tack; 1 to 2 inches will be plenty.  3. Take a look at the patch of canvas you just exposed. Choose a printed code to start with, and find the corresponding diamond bag. Pour out the diamonds into the tray.  4. Dip the pen into the gel to pick some up. This will make it possible for the pen to pick up the diamonds.  5. Use the pen to pick up a diamond. Gently press the tip of the pen against the top, faceted part of the diamond.  6. Gently press the diamond against the corresponding square. If you are just starting out, you?d better press lightly at first. So that you can nudge the diamond back into place if it is off-set, then press down on it to secure it.  7. Refill the pen with gel as needed. Continue filling the canvas in using the same technique as before until you finish the whole painting.  8. Cover the canvas with the plastic sheet that it came with. Go over the canvas with a rolling pin. This will press down any loose diamonds and secure them. You can also press it by heavy book instead.  9. You can frame the canvas and use it decorating your home!   Package list: 1. Pre-printed canvas 2. Diamond packs  3. Diamond Gel 4. Sticky pen 5. Tray 6. Plastic storage bags"
