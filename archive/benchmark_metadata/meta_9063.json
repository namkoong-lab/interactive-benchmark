        "Aldous Huxley's stature as one of the giants of modern English prose and of social commentary in our time is confirmed in this gathering of his distinguished stories into a single volume. Twenty-one pieces are here, including \"The Gioconda Smile,\" \"Little Mexican,\" \"Young Archimedes,\" and \"Chawdron.\" Together they offer a complete view of Huxley's work in the genre, in which he established himself as an acknowledged master."

        "Twenty-one distinguished stories, confirming Huxley's stature as one of the giants of modern English prose and of social commentary in our time. A very good book. -- V. S. PritchettThese stories ... reveal in snatches the real nature of his genius, which is essentially discursive, argumentative, analytical, and omnivorous.... [He is] always stimulating because of the sharp inquiring intellect at work, moving with equal liveliness to pinpoint an absurdity of character, as in `Chawdron,' or to feast on the pleasure of Italian life and painting. ―",
