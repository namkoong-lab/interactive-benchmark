        "Sometimes, a chance meeting is just the push you need in order to break free from the darkness within.",
        "Kissing? No way. That’s far too intimate.It’s my one rule: no kissing. At twenty-three, I haven’t willingly allowed another set of lips to touch mine. Most of my hook-ups don’t seem to mind, and I prefer it that way. I don’t want closeness. Only satisfaction. But then I meet Daniel. He’s such a geek, and definitely not the kind of guy I normally take an interest to. He’s shy. He’s quiet. And every time he smiles, my heart gallops, and it freaks me out. He’s breaking down my walls, getting closer, tempting me to break my rule... Will he be my first kiss? Or will he discover my truth and run the other way?"

        "About the Author",
        "Karen Ferry is a thirty-something writer, wife to a quiet, laidback man, and mother to a gorgeous, stubborn, redheaded girl who keeps her parents on their toes. Karen tends to have a short fuse if she does not get a proper caffeine fix first thing in the mornings, but she is, in fact, a gentle person deep down. Karen loves Italian food and wine, travelling, and spending time with her family. When she is not writing, she reads - her favourite genres are New Adult, Contemporary Romance, Erotica and Romantic Suspense. She can never get enough of romance. Or of too many book boyfriends, either. Even though Karen is Danish, she has always felt more at ease writing stories in English, and she has not read a book in her native tongue in over ten years. She can be very outspoken and a complete fan girl of other authors' online but will in fact be very shy once she meets you in person.",
