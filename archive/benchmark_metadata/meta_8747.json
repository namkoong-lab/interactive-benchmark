        "Are you close enough to your Master to hear His still small voice in your heart? If you can't hear Him, maybe it's because you are not where you are supposed to be? Get closer! Open His word and read. In this true story, the author compares two family pets. One is disobedient and must be kept on a short leash for his own safety, while the other obeys her master and is allowed to roam free."
