The aim of the book is to counteract the anti-Albanian propaganda waged by some parties, but never to propose a counter-propaganda hostile to others or to the goals of a democratic Kosova."

        "‘Centuries ago, at the dawn of this civilization, a war sung by Homer helped awaken the consciousness of antiquity. Three thousands years later, the Kosova conflict shook the whole of human society as no other modern war had done.’ - Ismail Kadare (winner of the 2005 International Man Booker Prize), from his afterword. This book makes the case for the independence of Kosova – the former province of ‘old-Yugoslavia’, temporarily a United Nations-led International protectorate – at a time in which international diplomacy is deeply involved in solving the contested issue of its final status. Negotiations began in January 2006 under the auspices of a United Nations Special Envoy, and have been given renewed impulse by the international community’s determination to arrive at a solution. The Case for Kosova aims to contribute to these negotiations, by providing informed arguments for a different approach to the issue of Kosova’s status beyond the limitations of current debates. Its aim is to counteract the anti-Albanian propaganda waged by some parties, but never to propose a counter-propaganda hostile to others or to the goals of democratic Kosova. Debates on Kosova have largely concentrated either on ideology and myth construction, ignoring historical realities; on geo-politics, confusing power politics with stability and security; or on policy, lacking a conceptual understanding of both ideologies and processes. There is no book that links these different fields in a persuasive manner. The Case for Kosova will fill this gap, with intellectually challenging and politically relevant debate.",

        "Is the Muslim conversion of Albanians the main cause of the estrangement between Slavs and Albanians? Noel Malcolm. THE ALLEGATION: Mass conversion to Islam by Albanians is believed to have opened an era of prevarication and inter-ethnic conflict, and to have inaugurated a deeper divide between the two groups, a divide configured as a clash of civilizations. There was no conflict between the Serbs and the Albanians in medieval Serbia. These problems began only at the end of the seventeenth century with the intensified Islamization of Albanian newcomers. (The Memorandum on Kosovo and Metohija of the Holy Synod of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, September 2003). The Ottomans breakthrough into the heart of Southeast Europe also marked the beginning of the five-centuries-long clash of two civilizations: European (Christian) and Near Eastern (Islamic). The conflict, alive to this day, is visibly evident also in the clash of the two nations: the Serbs, mainly Orthodox Christians, and the ethnic Albanians, mainly Muslims.(Duan Batakovic, Former Ambassador of Serbia and Montenegro to Greece, historian and advisor of President Boris Tadic on Kosova). The Answer: On the face of it, the suggestion made by this question is plausible. If estrangement means something more than just a consciousness of difference, if it means some sort of alienation or suspicion that leads to hostility and conflict, then a general estrangement between two populations looks as if it must have some general causes. Religion does constitute a general difference between Serbs and Albanians: almost all Serbs are Orthodox, and the great majority of Albanians in Kosova are Muslim. In both cases, the religious label may imply active participation in religious life, or it may refer only to cultural background; much of the urban population today goes neither to the mosque nor to church. On the other hand, language is an even more general difference: all Albanians, both Muslim and Catholic, speak Albanian. But it would be odd to suggest that hostility between Serbs and Albanians arises simply from their speaking different languages; the fact of difference does not necessarily lead to the fact of conflict. Some other conflict-engendering factors must be involved. Where the claim about religious difference engendering hostility is concerned, those other factors are, we are told, to be found in the whole nature of life under Ottoman rule. Christians had a legal status in Ottoman society, but that status was a secondary one; they suffered some disabilities, such as their testimony not being accepted against that of a Muslim in court, and paid some extra taxes. The ruling class above all, the big landowners, who exercised local powerwas Muslim. Therefore the Christian Serbs resented the Muslim Albanians. Although there is some truth in this, there is not enough to justify a yes to the question. Oppression by local pashas was a fact of life, but it bore on Muslim peasants as well as Christian ones. The great majority of Serbs were peasants working the land; the great majority of Muslim Albanians were peasants working the land; for most of the Ottoman period their conditions of life, and their grievances, were virtually the same. In 1689 both Serbs and Muslim Albanians joined with the Austrian army in Kosova to fight against the Ottomans. In 1822 about 3,000 people took part in a great protest march from Kosova to Istanbul to demand the removal of a tyrannical pasha from Prishtina: the protesters included both Serb peasants and the imams of the local mosques. Only in the mid-nineteenth century did the religious divide begin to act as the fault-line of an internal political conflict. The cause lay in the geopolitics of the surrounding region: new states with Christian identities (Serbia and Greece, at first) were eager to extend their territories, and therefore keen to activate unredeemed populations of ethnic brethren outside their borders. And when they did acquire new territory, they expelled or mistreated the Muslim populaion. The Ottoman Empire went onto the defensive, and its Christian inhabitants began to be regarded, by their own Muslim neighbours, as a potential fifth column. For some Albanians, this furnished a pretext for the mistreatment of local Serbs. Serb nationalist doctrine emphasized the role of the Orthodox Church as an essential constituent of Serb identity. Albanian nationalist doctrine, on the other hand, emphasized the Albanian language, accepting the religious diversity of the Albanians. There was thus a basic asymmetry between the two positions. But the Serb doctrine was, historically, the more important: it was formed earlier, it was embodied in a Serbian state long before the Albanians had any government of their own, and it was that state which, in 1912, conquered most of Kosova and put it under de facto Serbian rule. Religion thus mattered, to a certain extent, in reality, because it mattered in Serbian national ideology. The main reason for the estrangement of the Serbs and Albanians in Kosova lies, therefore, in modern political history. But the most important part of that history is the period from 1912 to the present. The massacres of Albanians during and following the initial conquest; the systematic maltreatment of Albanians in the inter-war years; the vicious reprisals against Serbs during World War II; the heavy repression of the early Tito period; the quasi-apartheid and mass-expulsions of the Miloevic years: these are the most important factors in explaining any contemporary estrangement. Compared with these, religion is just one part of the background.",
