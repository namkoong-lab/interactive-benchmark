        "About the Author",
        "C.S. Krishna is a self-proclaimed legendary development consultant. He wants to make it big as a public policy guru but three years of writing satire for The UnReal Times under the pseudonym Unreal Mama has rendered him incapable of thinking seriously. He has an engineering degree from IIT Bombay, an MS from The Ohio State University and an MBA from IIMAhmedabad.  Karthik Laxman has a degree in software engineering from BITS-Pilani and an MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad. In his career he has taken more U-turns than Mulayam Singh Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal put together, transitioning from a programmer to management consultant to development specialist to entrepreneur to sundry other roles, before finding his calling as a househusband. He also writes for and manages The UnReal Times."
