    "description": [
        "The current flag, adopted in 1978, consists of nine alternating blue and white horizontal stripes of equal width – with both the top and bottom stripe being blue. At the top left corner of the Greek flag is a white cross centered in a blue base. The stripes, some believe, stand for the nine syllables of the Greek patriots' motto: \"Eleutheria e Thanatos,\" meaning \"Freedom or Death,\" while the cross symbolizes Greek Orthodoxy, the established religion of the country. The blue and white colors are meant to symbolize the sea, sky, and purity of the country’s struggle for freedom and independence. Family-owned for six generations, Annin Flagmakers takes special pride in producing high-quality, American-made state, international, and military flags. All Annin Flagmakers flags are sewn in either South Boston, VA or Coshocton, OH. Our superior quality is time-tested and meets the requirements of the most discerning buyer. Nyl-Glo, Tough-Tex, and Bulldog are registered trademarks manufactured exclusively by Annin Flagmakers."
