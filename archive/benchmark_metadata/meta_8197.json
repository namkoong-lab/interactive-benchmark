        "Review",
        "\" 'From G to PG to R to X' follows the devolution of national politics, sexual politics and political correctness in the polarized nation of Amourrica Profunda. Loaded with caricatures, including a talking octopus, who disappear and reappear, the story shatters literary conventions. In [From G to PG to R to X] unpopular capitalist and former chancellor Tumerico Inflammatorio ... has an oddball family whose sole goal is to make money and remain in power. Inflammatorio's exploitation of a nation too delusional or distracted to stop him is blatant. Most of the cast is shallow, including Tumerico's daughter ... There are a bevy of untalented, unapologetic, soulless capitalists. The more lines that are devoted to a character, the more cartoonish they appear. With adults like this steering the ship, the inevitable ending is cataclysm. There are long, madcap passages in a stream-of-consciousness style; they include some humorous commentary about newly named orientations like asexuality and other terms among the latest parlance ... The book suggests that ridiculousness reigns across the political spectrum ... More of a montage of story fragments than a cohesive novel ... Often, scenes seem present more for their entertainment value than they are to service the plot. For example, a shaman investigates a local cult ceremony featuring colorful, informal banter between ... two women who chat about being smitten with Inflammatorio: 'I love the way he mats down that dirty orange combover of his with Vaseline!' ... Surprises ensue, as with a violent scene ... whose ending upends expectations ... 'From G to PG to R to X' delights in following the world's cocksure zooming in the wrong direction.\"Clarion Foreword ReviewsClarion Rating: 4 out of 5\"... [A] surreal satire ... divisive culture wars ... mayhem ... [a] storytelling maelstrom ... the long history of Amourrica Profunda and its disintegration ...The country of Amourrica Profunda was once a place where society was civil and people respected one another's diverse views. Now, political and social chaos has torn the country apart. A main cause of this disintegration is the commitment of some to the belief that 'an autocrat could save the country from a supposed cultural downward spiral.' The dictator in question goes by the name of Turmerico Inflammatorio ... No one could accuse him of presenting a false persona ... there's 'no discernible difference between 9 to 5 Turmerico and Off-Hours Inflammatorio -- He was depraved, deranged and demented 24-7.' Pamm Demmyck and Remmy Dessyvyr are two writing partners ... they hope one day to be celebrated for their 'monumental contributions to the entertainment industry.' Success looks certain for Pamm and Remmy with their upcoming work, 'Conceal and Carry: The Musical' ... until the production runs into trouble due to some domestic terrorists ... [This] wild, whirlwind work ... includes a cult ceremony involving Midwesterners who love latex and one character's burning down a house with a flamethrower. Turmerico's daughter Francka is particularly notable; she spends her workdays 'screaming at people that she considered to be idiots' and burns her 8-year-old daughter Deandra's artwork while Deandra watches ... Bird succeeds in creating a world in which seemingly anything is possible ... A convoluted but highly comical take on a nation in turmoil.\"-- Kirkus Reviews",
