        "10% of all women have PCOS, making it the most common female endocrine disorder and cause of female infertility in the world. Women with PCOS may suffer from acne, menstrual irregularity, infertility, obesity, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and heart disease. Traditionally, doctors treat symptoms one at a time, often with a new regime of pills for each symptom. This approach never addresses the underlying causes of PCOS so women are medicated but never healed.",
        "With decades of experience as a board-certified OB-GYN and Integrative Medicine doctor and with the knowledge gained from her personal PCOS journey, Dr. Felice Gersh has helped thousands of women lose weight, heal their acne, reverse their chronic diseases, and reclaim their fertility.",
        "In seven simple but revolutionary steps,",
        "PCOS SOS",

There is never a one-size-fits-all method to approaching and managing PCOS. Dr. Gersh's book provides a deep understanding of the condition and a variety of treatment options that will help both healthcare providers and patients think more holistically and strategically about PCOS care. PCOS SOS can help readers discover options and answers that they may not otherwise find. Dr. Gersh's work is a jewel!\"",
