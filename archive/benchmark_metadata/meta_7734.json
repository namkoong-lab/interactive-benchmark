        "In 1983, in Australia, a medical resident, Dr. Barry Marshall, and a hospital pathologist, Dr. Robin Warren, reported in two letters to The Lancet finding a bacterium associated with gastritis or inflammation of the stomach. The publication stimulated little reaction. However, a year later when they reported that the bacterium was also associated with ulcer disease and declared that bacteria caused ulcer disease, it had the effect of an assassination of an archduke. Most prominent clinical investigators in the United States and England argued that hyper secretion of acid was the cause of ulcer disease, and they collaborated with the pharmaceutical companies that made the new drugs that blocked acid secretion to attack the new bacterial theory. The Great Ulcer War tells how the war was fought, the weapons used, and the alliances made, and why the war in spite of overwhelming evidence in favor of the bacterial theory, lasted for ten years. The Great Ulcer War introduces a novel theory, the Pandora Hypothesis, to explain the length of the war. It proposes that the general medical establishment especially in the United States simply did not like the bacterial theories of major chronic diseases. These thought leaders—\"the big guys\"—facilitated and prolonged the opposition to the bacterial theory of ulcers largely by doing nothing to support the theory until the very end of the war. They were afraid that if a germ theory was accepted for ulcers, a Pandora's Box of germ theories developed within university departments of microbiology for other chronic diseases would be opened and released into the medical world. This revelation would diminish the reputation and profit of the medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry by threatening their favored explanations of the causes of these diseases: genomic errors and dysfunctional biochemistry and physiology."

        "Review",
        "An engaging slice of recent medical history and controversy. In this debut book on the history of medicine, Hughes does a remarkable job of balancing the researcher's precision with the storyteller's understanding of his audience. Hughes traces the shifts in the medical community's understanding of ulcers and their causes. Hughes is unstinting in his indictment of the pharmaceutical companies who, he says, used their financial power to discredit the bacterial theory, which threatened the profitable market for Zantac and Tagamet. The writing is energetic and often witty, as when Hughes compares drug sales representatives at conferences to \"a gastric cell and a swarm of Helicobacter.\" Hughes describes his own minor role in advancing the bacterial theory--he counseled Sen. Ted Kennedy's staff to promote Helicobacter research--and there is no coyness about his position as a passionately interested participant. That passion shows as the book traces the long tension between treatment and profit, demonstrating the substantial power held by major pharmaceutical companies looking to protect their investments. Despite the strength of the opponents, this book is the story of the triumph of knowledge and evidence, and Hughes concludes with both the establishment's acceptance of bacterial theory and a sense of hope for the future of medicine. A well-written story of medicine, money and politics written by a knowledgeable physician.",
        "Kirkus Reviews",
        "William Hughes skillfully weaves a tale of clinical science, politics, intrigue, and medical history to make the case that the US gastroenterology establishment was unusually dogged in its opposition to a pathogenic role for H. pylori. Hughes does not pull his punches and writes irreverently- naming names and detailing discussions. Hughes is particularly adept at explaining the complexities of clinical medicine, translational science and the institutions that govern US health policy and funding.",
        "Bottom Line",
        ": I thoroughly recommend this book-it is an easy read, but with germane messages to those both inside and outside of the academic gastroenterology bubble. Hughes’s thesis is well argued and indicates clearly where he stands. Even if the reader is opposed to this viewpoint based on a personal view of the H. pylori saga, at the very least the book should lead one to reflect on the processes by which medical science advances and on whether our institutions are any better prepared now to embrace the next H. pylori.
