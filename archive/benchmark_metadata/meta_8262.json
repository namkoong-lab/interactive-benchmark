        "Third title in the Spin the Globe: The Incredible Adventures of Frederick von Wigglebottom travel adventure book series. The series is fun and educational, based on bedtime stories once told to my daughter and son.Each night, they would ask Daddy to tell them a story. After  every variation of animal, astronaut, knights, and princess stories I could come up with, one evening I noticed the globe that sat atop a dresser. I asked them to help me pick the story by spinning the globe. Tonight the globe stopped on Peru, the Land of the Incas.  As Frederick grabs his trusty journal and prepares to explore Cusco, ancient Incan ruins and magnificent Andes Mountains, he is joined by his new friends, Ernesto and Umiña.  Explore with him as he learns about the people, history, sites, and animals of the Andes and the Incan Empire."

        "Imagine taking your kids on a world tour without ever leaving the house. That's the idea behind author Edward Moldenhauer's",
        "Spin the Globe: The Incredible Adventures of Frederick von Wigglebottom.",
        "For fresh kids' bedtime story ideas, Ed had them spin & point to a random place on the globe; wherever their finger landed, that became the setting for his next tale.Each book in the series features colorful illustrations, conversational prose, & a glossary of terms in the back, making these book great for children-and parents-of all ages.",
        "- Dr. Janelle Alex, PhD, Co-founder of AuthorsTalkAboutIt.com",
        "Ed crafted colorful & exciting tales focused on faraway lands.  FvWb is a world traveler & explorer in these tales.  Four of these interesting stories are available to share with your kiddos. With a copy of any of the series in hand we, as parents, can travel the world with our children while snuggled up in bed. Ideas are sparked and we can almost hear the computer begging us to research more about the culture, ancient history, fascinating animals, ceremonies & more that FvWb learns from his new & diverse group of friends.",
        "From the Author",
        "Do you remember when you were about six or seven?  Going to bed each night was sometimes a little scary or at least an undesirable event.  Do you remember when someone would read you a bedtime story?  Do you remember visualizing the characters, the scenes and the actions?  Flipping through the pages of a fun story with colorful pictures, cuddling close and listening intently to where the story would lead...It is my hope that these stories not only entertain but serve as the catalyst to broaden children's horizons, instill a desire to learn even more, recognize the wonderful diversity that exists in the world and to become good citizens of our planet.",
