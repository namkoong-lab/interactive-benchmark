        "Beautiful The Extra Fine Basmati Rice, is rare and not grown anywhere else on earth. This Pusa Basmati (Raw) variety of Kohinoor is the new generation of Basmati. With 7.55 mm long grains, this basmati is selectively picked and aged for around 1-2 years, a reason why even a small quantity of this basmati looks more when cooked and has a little bit of sweetness in its taste with an aroma that will certainly cast a spell on you. is clean hair. There is no reason for a shampoo to contain oils. Oil does not clean hair. Oils and animal byproducts coat the hair with a heavy film leaving hair looking dull and lifeless. Our oilfree extra body shampoo gently cleans the hair. Now hair glows with extra body and more luster. A natural shampoo, recommended for fine, listless hair."
