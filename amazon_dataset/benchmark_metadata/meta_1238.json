        "Ceramides are naturally found in skin's vulnerable outer layer and help skin retain moisture. When skin's ceramide levels are low, skin has difficulty retaining moisture. While traditional lotions only hydrate skins surface, Curél moisturizers work at the source of dryness to help replenish skin's ceramide levels, not just relieving symptoms, but actually, over time, preventing symptoms from recurring."
