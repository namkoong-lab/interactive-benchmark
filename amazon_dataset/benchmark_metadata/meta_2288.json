        "Get rid of natural deodorants that leave you smelling stinky, and use Freedom’s high-quality Roll-on Deodorant! We use high-grade oils from sweet-smelling plants like vanilla, amber, mint, and peach to keep you smelling fresh all day. After regular use, the all-natural deodorant will work to cleanse your body of toxins left from antiperspirants. If you experience an unpleasant odor, there is no need to worry; it is your body evicting the toxins, and it will go away in a few days. It is baking soda-free and pH balanced for sensitive skin so your whole family can enjoy the benefits of this fantastic deodorant. No need to worry, all of our products are phthalate, paraben, gluten and, cruelty-free, so you and your family can have peace of mind while using our products.How to useLift your arm above your head, and roll the ball against the skin of your underarm area. No need to overapply, a little goes a long way. Patch test a small area on your forearm to check for sensitivity or allergy.Our StoryAt Freedom, our goal is to create a natural deodorant that works. After realizing most natural deodorants on the market don’t live up to expectations, we wanted to create a product that was not only 100% natural, but highly effective. Our deodorants are so natural you could eat them–although they work better than they taste. Most importantly, a portion of our proceeds goes towards breast cancer research. Be happy, not stinky!"
