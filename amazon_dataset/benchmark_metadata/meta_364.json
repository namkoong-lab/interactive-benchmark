        "In order to cook like a pro, you need the proper tools like the Ronco Boning Knife #7. This knife is designed to easily separate meat from the bone while cooking. The semi-flexible knife is easy to use and smoothly slices close to the bone with little hassle. Use the knife on beef, fish, pork, poultry, and lamb. Its narrower design is perfect for working in closer areas around bones. The knife measures 12.75 inches in length and is perfectly balanced for fine control. A full stainless steel tang and triple riveting provide durability and strength, while the impact-resistant white handle offers a gorgeous look."
