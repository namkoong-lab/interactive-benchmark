        "Ambroxan, the answer to every perfumer's prayers, it's a substitute for Ambergris. Ambroxan is an aroma-molecule that harnesses all the sweet, earthy, musky characteristics of the real thing, to envelop the wearer in a haze of warmth without overpowering. It waxes and wanes throughout the day, fading, only to resurface just when you've almost forgotten you're wearing it."
