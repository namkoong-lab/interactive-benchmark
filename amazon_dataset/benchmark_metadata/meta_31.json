        "Zydeco Chop Chop is a blend of Dehydrated Onion, Dehydrated Garlic, Dehydrated Red and Green Bell Pepper, Dehydrated Celery, Dehydrated Green Onion, and Dehydrated Parsley flakes. Created from a rich tradition rooted deep in Cajun culture, Zydeco Chop Chop is already blended and ready to use in anything from traditional Cajun favorites to regular American fare. Use liberally as a replacement for the Cajun Trinity (Onions, Bell Pepper and Celery). Simply rehydrate with a 1/2 cup of water for every 1/4 cup of Chop Chop Cajun Seasoning Base (8 Ounce Bag yields approximately 8 servings), saving time chopping up produce the old-fashioned way. Provides a Cajun twist on all manner of dishes including cornbread or rice dressing, chicken or potato salad, crab cakes, jambalaya, etouffee, deviled eggs, breakfast strata, stuffed peppers and more - the possibilities are endless. From Opelousas, Louisiana deep in the heart of Cajun Country."
