The professional Steam Brush smooths and transforms unmanageable, frizzy hair into soft silky, shiny hair. The Steam Brush enables you to Straighten, Wave or Curl hair quickly and efficiently in one single pass by combining the Steam Treatment Infusion System with Infrared Heat Energy. How does this innovative technology work? The Steam Brush releases a continuous flow of steam which delivers conditioning treatments into the opened hair cuticle. The heat then closes the hair cuticle sealing in the Conditioning Treatment, eliminating split ends, resulting in flawless, hydrated hair with natural movement. How to use, 70-100 Seconds initial heat time to reach default temperature; 45 seconds for steam temperature. Once the indicator light steadies, steam brush is ready to be used at desired heat. Press any button besides the power button to unlock the steam-brush screen. During first use, operate steam manually; it will take about 90 seconds to initiate. Press the power button to unlock and shut off steam brush. How to straighten with steam, Make sure iron is pulling down on hair in direction of arrows on the top plate.
