        "Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is designed exclusively for teens, tweens, pre teens, and boys and girls to work as an effective, yet gentle body wash. Natural ingredients like Allantoin and Bisabolol nourish beyond surface level, and penetrate into the lower levels of the skin for the deepest hydration possible, while active ingredient tea tree oil works to fight body acne and skin issues teens are commonly prone to. Unlike shower bars and other soaps, our products are designed to soothe problematic and compromised skin. With 100% Natural ingredients that are paraben, sulfate, fragrance, and gluten free, the Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is gentle enough for every day use. Our mission is to provide teens (like our own!) with a body wash that leaves them feeling fresh and confident so they can focus on what really matters- every day.
