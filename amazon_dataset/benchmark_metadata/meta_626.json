        "Yves Rocher Monoi de Tahiti Lagoon Hair and Body Wash, 200 ml./ 6.7 fl.oz. MONOÏ. The Yves Rocher research division has selected a Monoï de Tahiti that is AOC certified (controlled designation of origin). It is obtained by macerating fresh tiare flowers in coconut oil, grown exclusively in the coralline soil and volcanic rock of French Polynesia. Did you know? Monoï, a truly traditional beauty secret of Tahitian women, means \"scented oil\" in the Polynesian language. Tahitian women apply this 100 % natural botanical elixir to their skin and hair to enhance their beauty and to wear its heavenly scent. Key botanicals: 100% Botanical oil Monoï de Tahiti, organic aloe vera gel. How To: Use this shampoo after the beach or at the end of the day to eliminate the last tracks of salt and sand.  Rinse abundantly in the clear water. In case of projection in the eye, rinse abundantly. End with a rinsing in the clear water to tighten hair fibers and make them more brilliant."
