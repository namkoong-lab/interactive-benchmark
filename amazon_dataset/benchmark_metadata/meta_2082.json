        "Yeah! Now you don't have to rub an uncomfortable crystal under your arm to get protection from odors. Formulated with Angstrom Zinc and Silver which kill odor-causing bacteria to make a pleasant body and foot deodorant. Effective and easy to use. It is used to clog your underarm pores, so you don't sweat... not a good thing to do! A concentration of toxins in any area of the body can lead to cell mutations Yes, ANTIPERSPIRANT. Most of the products out there are an antiperspirant/deodorant combination, so check your labels. Deodorant is fine, antiperspirant is not. HEALTH BENEFITS: Certain Essential Oils are specific to the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system flows throughout the body groups: under the arms, breast, groin area and neck. Methylparabens and other harmful chemicals used in most commercial deodorants are being found in tumors in their ester form, which indicates the chemical is entering the body through the skin and not by oral ingestion. Our deodorant actually stimulates lymphatic flow to help rid your body of toxins."
