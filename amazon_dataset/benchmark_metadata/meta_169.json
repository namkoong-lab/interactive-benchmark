        "A true French classic, Pillivuyt's Brasserie Eared Onion Soup Bowls are exceptional in their finishing detail. With its classic French café menu pattern it is a wonderful addition to any kitchen. This pattern was created in the 1920's for restaurants and cafes that wished to have their menus on their dinnerware. The Brasserie pattern retains the original French menus with prices! The design is printed on a decal and then applied by hand, which requires patience, a steady hand and great attention to detail. After the decal is applied, the piece is fired for a third time and the design is baked into a hard coating of glaze, making it permanent and impervious to scratching or wearing off. All Pillivuyt dishes are made with Pillivuyt's proprietary porcelain recipe. The \"ear\" handles are a traditional design and allow you to hold and carry the dish easily; the glaze, as in all Pillivuyt items, will not craze, stain, or discolor, and cleans up with amazing ease. The 15 ounce, Eared Onion Soup Bowl is another addition to the single-serving options. Ideal for serving soup or making individual servings of pasta and casseroles. This is a nice-sized dish for small-meal presentations. Pillivuyt porcelain is the finest culinary porcelain in the world. This bowl epitomizes Pillivuyt's exceptionally fine detailing. Use this classic on the dinner table with your finest china. It is dishwasher-safe and resistant to scratching and chipping. All Pillivuyt products are lead and cadmium-free and guaranteed 100% food-safe. Pillivuyt porcelain is hand-crafted by artisans in a French factory that was family-founded in 1818."
