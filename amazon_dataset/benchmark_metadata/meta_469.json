        "Spagmoss Premium New Zealand Sphagnum Moss is a commercial grade S Cristatum, harvested from the pristine environment of New Zealands southern west coast. It has a length of at least 100mm for 70% of the product. It is an attractive light brown / cream color with some green tips. Sphagnum moss is a versatile, long lasting product renowned for its water holding capacity. New Zealand Sphagnum moss is recognized worldwide as a premium product in the orchid growing industry. Besgrow Spagmoss is naturally air dried to ensure a maximum Water Holding Capacity (WHC) of 96%. This allows the moss to retain water and nutrients for easy release to the plant without accumulating unwanted salts. Spagmoss maintains its structure in the pot for several years, therefore costs associated with re-potting are reduced. Due to its sterile nature, Spagmoss will also defend against plant pathogens from attacking the roots."
