        "You think cutting soft cheese is a sticky affair? Not with this stainless steel designer knife. A narrower blade implies a lower chance of sticking. More enjoyment!",
        "NO STICKING:",
        "The narrow blade has less surface area for cheese to stick to",
        "IDEAL FOR:",
        "Soft (and sticky) cheeses such as Brie and Camembert",
        "EUROPEAN DESIGN:",
        "100% stainless steel, cast in one piece",
        "For which types of cheese?",
        "This sleek and stylish knife is best suited to cutting soft cheeses. Try it out on cheeses like Brie, Camembert, Taleggio, and Humboldt Fog!",
        "Different knives for each cheese?",
        "Every cheese deserves its own knife, because cheese varies so much in its properties and structure. With the right knife, it only gets easier, and the cheese experience gets even better. Take, for example, this Brie Knife. The narrow blade has less surface area, so the cheese has less ‘knife’ to stick to. This means you’ll slice through soft and sticky cheeses much more smoothly and easily.",
        "Maintenance",
        "This knife is dishwasher safe, however we do recommend that you hand wash this tool so it stays sharp - just like all high quality knives.",
        "10 Year Guarantee",
        "Boska Holland works hard to procure materials of the highest quality and produce its products through expert manufacturing. We're proud of our cheese tools and believe they will stand the test of time, so we offer you a 10 year guarantee on this product.",
        "About Boska Holland Cheesewares",
