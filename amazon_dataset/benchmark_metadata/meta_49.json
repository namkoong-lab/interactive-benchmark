        "White kaolin, also known as China or white clay, is basically the mildest of all clays. It is suitable for sensitive skin. It helps stimulate circulation to the skin while gently exfoliating and cleansing it. It does not draw oils from the skin and can therefore be used on dry skin types. To use as a facial or body treatment: Mix clay with water until it forms a paste and apply to skin. Leave on for about 10-15 minutes and rinse off with warm water. This all natural clay can be used alone or blended with other herbs and oils!"
