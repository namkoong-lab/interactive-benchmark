        "Transport yourself to the tropics with this all-over Organic Coconut Oil treatment for the body, and face. A perfect pick-me-up for dry skin, damaged nails and dull hair. This deeply nourishing, intensely moisturizing, beautifying Coconut Oil radiates a healthy sheen. Scented with our signature tropical pina colada, this dry oil formulation absorbs into the skin without an oily residue. A slice of tropical paradise anytime of the year. Gently massage in a few drops of oil to freshly clean, dry skin. Ideal for repetitive moisturization application throughout the day. Also suitable to add a few drops in bath water to soften and sooth skin. FEATURED INGREDIENTS Sweet Almond Oil: Known to be a great emollient and is loved for its ability to soften and re-condition the skin. It contains an abundance of proteins and Vitamin D, providing an extremely nourishing effect to the skin, particularly with regular use. Sweet Almond Oil can soothe dry skin and help restore irritated areas. Organic Coconut Oil: An amazing natural moisturizer. Coconut Oil is packed with medium chain fatty acids/triglycerides. Vitamin E: Known to be a powerful antioxidant which can cool and soothe the irritation of dry skin, helping reduce the appearance of fine lines. Avocado Oil: Known to be well suited for dry skin types as it can hold great moisturizing properties and is believed to leave the skin feeling smooth and nourished. It can also promote skin repair with its abundance of lecithin and plant sterols. Grapeseed Oil: A very popular oil for cosmetic applications because of its lightweight, satin-like finish on the skin. Not only is it a fantastic emollient that can leave the skin silky and hydrated, but it is low allergy and possesses astringent properties that make it beneficial for oily and acne-prone skin. Castor Oil: Soothing for all skin types and may assist in sealing in moisture, leaving the skin nourished and protected."
