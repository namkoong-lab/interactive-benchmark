        "This is a vegan MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO bar perfectly formulated for wavy, curly and coily hair,providing deep cleanse and hydration. Our uniquely combined natural ingredients will provide you with that moisture boost your hair deserves. Contains Shikakai extract which is widely known for its “curl memorizer” effect, defining your curls for a longer period of time. Enjoy your #plasticfree shower.",
        "OUR MISSION: We like to inspire our customers to live a more minimalist life, prioritizing conscient consumption decision making. One Bars Over Bottles shampoo is equivalent to two average sized (6.7oz) shampoo bottles, and one conditioner bar to three plastic bottles. Join our #plasticfreebathroom mission!",
        "THE FUTURE IS WATERLESS: our shampoo and conditioner bars eliminate plastic packaging and are logistically much more efficient. The packaging industry is responsible for the world's largest plastic production, overloading our environment with single use plastic. Why carry bottled water along the entire supply chain and into our homes, when we already have water in our bathrooms?",
        "BARS OVER BOTTLES: We develop products that make you proud to have at home. Did you know that liquid cosmetics are made up of 80% water and leave an embarrassing carbon footprint throughout their entire supply chain. For this reason, we transform liquid personal hygiene and beauty products into bars containing only the ingredients that you really need. You already have water at home.",
        "LEADING PLASTIC-FREE BRAND: We are proud to be the leading 100% waterless, plastic free, zero waste & clean beauty company in Brazil, eliminating the use of over 100,000 plastic bottles every month. We have an internal R&D team leading our mission of combining edge technology with the best of natural & non-toxic ingredients. Let's clean our waters."
