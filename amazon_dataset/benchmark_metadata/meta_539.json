MAVEA products were introduced to North America in 2009 to offer consumers premium water filtration experiences.",
        "From the Manufacturer",
        "MAVEA Maxtra is the next generation in water filter technology; radically redesigned and re-shaped for greater performance. The new shape features performance advantages. The filter ingredients won’t get packed down at the bottom which can cause reduced filtration efficacy. Moreover, the MAVEA filter is designed to have maximum contact time with water to provide consistent performance over the life of the filter. No pre-soaking is required to activate the filter. The filter has a micro-screen which reduces black particle release in the pitcher. The filter is treated with silver to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Our filters are certified by the WQA (Water Quality Association) to NSF/ANSI Standards 42 and 53. This means that they have passed standard tests to reduce chlorine taste and odor, heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium and copper, agricultural chemicals and industrial pollutants. MAVEA has business partners who endorse the reliable performance of the MAVEA Maxtra filters. Select models of the Tassimo coffee brewing machine also uses the same MAVEA Maxtra filter to treat the water so the coffee looks and tastes its best. We recognize that our business is not about a product, but rather a natural resource. Americans send an estimated 38 billion water bottles to landfills each year. Each MAVEA Maxtra filter replaces approximately 300 bottles of water and could represent 300 fewer bottles in landfill. To take it one step further, MAVEA has developed an innovative and comprehensive end-to-end recycling program that reuses 100% of the MAVEA Maxtra filter materials. Filters can be sent to MAVEA in the mail, or placed in recycling bins in retail partner locations. Nothing ends up in a landfill. MAVEA Maxtra filters are also available in a convenient 3-pack."
