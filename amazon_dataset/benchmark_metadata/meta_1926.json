This means, whichever model of iPhone, iPod touch or iPad you got at hand, as long as they are using the Lightning cables, you are covered.Works with Original Power AdaptorThe iPhone charging cables and data syncing lines we provide can work with your original Apple Power Adaptor perfectly, meaning, you don’t need to buy separate adaptors to go with our cables if you still have your original one. Simply connect the iPhone data cable to the USB adaptor and then plug the adaptor to a wall-mounted socket, or directly plug the data line to the USB dock on a computer, you can recharge your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch model, or synchronize data quickly.Toughly DurableThe durability is a critical factor to a long lifespan. To that end, we use the thicker-diameter copper wire to make the charging and data transmission cable. And we applied additional zinc alloy layer to both ends of the able, the Lighting connector and the USB connector. Our test results report that the cable itself is capable of 4,000 times bending, at 90 degrees, and the two connectors can survive up to 10,000 times of repeated plugs and unplugs.Three Lengths to Meet Different SituationsInside the pack, there are 4 pieces of Lightning cables, with 3 different lengths, one piece in 3 feet, two pieces in 6 feet and another piece in 10 feet."
