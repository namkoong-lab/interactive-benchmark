      "Q2.",
      "For Full Head?",
      "A:",
      "About 100g/bundle. Usually 3 bundles are enough to make a full head. If you like THICKER or need LONGER hair, it's best to wear one more bundle,as the Longer the Length is, the Thinner the hair is.",
      "Q3.",
      "Why there is No Shedding with our hair?",
      "A:",
      "No more than 3% shedding of the new hair is within the whole industry standard,our quality is higher:Double Machined  Weft and Korean Glue make the weft strong  and no shedding.",
      "Q5.",
      "Why is the hair weave getting Shedding and tangle?",
      "A:",
      "Because of drying, grease and dirt accumulation, salt water, chlorine gas and comb (untie) ,your hair is curly, your hair is tangled.So make sure washing and nursing your hair at least once a week,or twice a week."
