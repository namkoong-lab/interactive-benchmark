      "Description: If you have sparse eyebrows, or you are worried about drawing eyebrows every day in the morning, then our eyebrow stamp stencil kit, is perfect for you. Our eyebrow stamp has excellent staying power with a wear time of 16 hours. Rest assured, it will last you all through the day and evening without the need for reapplication. How to use: 1. Choose a suitable eyebrow stencil and align it to the position you want according to the grid lines. 2. Use the eyebrow cream cushion to pat the vacant part of the stencil gently starting from the tail of the eyebrow, until the filling is complete. 3. Use the eyebrow brush to modify the natural eyebrows. If the color is not dark enough, reinstall the template and continue to apply. The color may look lighter or darker on different skin shades. We would love to provide a replacement if you are not satisfied with the color or other aspects."
