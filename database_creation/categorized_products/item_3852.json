      "Could turquoise be the new pearls? Timeless turquoise is quickly gaining classic status When you think classic jewelry, pearls often come to mind. A staple in every woman’s collection, she knows she can count on them for timeless style. There’s another gemstone that has withstood the fickleness of fashion as well as the passage of millennia. We’re talking turquoise. The blue beauty is quickly gaining classic status. Very few stones have a color that is so well known, so characteristic, and so impressive that it’s become a color as well as gorgeous jewelry. The ancient Egyptians were onto turquoise’s timeless appeal from the beginning, adorning themselves with intricately carved turquoise jewelry. Turquoise is especially sacred to the Native American tribes in the southwestern United States where artisans have created an iconic jewelry style that truly captures the beauty of earth and sky. Beloved for its variety of colors from robin’s egg blue to sea foam green, turquoise is a timeless treasure. The necklace you see here gives 95 total carats of this epic gem a modern twist with multiple strands of turquoise gently enhanced to bring out that distinct and beloved shade we all love. And the price? It’s easy to love too."
