    "description": [
      "This item is intended for large homes or homes with 8-9 tvs/modems. This is not a gain maker, it equalizes every port equally from every port that is used. If you are looking to boost signal, you may want to call your cable provider, this is not the product for you. This is intended to take away loss from splitters and lower upstream. If you do not understand what this means, you need to google it before purchasing. In no way shape fashion or form will this put a band-aid signal"
