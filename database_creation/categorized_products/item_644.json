      "Product Description",
      "Vocalist sounds like the Latin version of Chris Isaac, singing w. The fiery flamenco guitar of Charlie Baran, bassist Dave Hiltebrand, Chuck Sansone, Tim Krause & Kim Docter - the songs are romantic originals inspired by the love songs of old Latin America, w. Spanish vocals",
      "Review",
      "\"...probably the finest debut to come out of the Windy City this year.\" Chicago's New City Billboard Magazine placed Casolando first among their \"Four Chicago Acts to Follow.\" And Rolling Stone Magazine named them in its 99 Summer Guide One as three \"Local Upstarts\" to watch for.",
      "ARTIST BIO: Born in Bogota, Columbia, lead vocalist and principal songwriter Carlos Ortega came to Chicago at age four and grew up playing guitar in punk, surf, and rockabilly bands. Through stories he heard his father tell, he became intrigued with the days of the South American cafes of the 1930's and 40's - stories of a mood and place and time after the bottle was empty and the old lp's were carefully placed on the turntable.",
      "Honduran-born Charlie Baran contributes two originals of his own. An internationally acclaimed lead guitarist, Charlie has more licks than the flashiest rock guitarist, but knows that sometimes a beautiful, subtle lead is called for.",
      "Bassist Dave Hiltebrand, already an accomplished jazz performer before this date, plays six-string bass and fretless bass.",
      "Percussionist Chuck Sansone entered this recording as a guest on congas, but has since earned full time stature with his skillful handling of these hot Latin rhythms in live performance. --",
