      "Absolutely stunning digitally remixed and remastered six CD box set featuring three complete live shows by this Classic Rock band, recorded live in Germany in 1976 during their first world tour. The band, at this stage, featured Ritchie Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio, Cozy Powel and Tony Carey. Although each of the three shows (from September 25, 27 and 28) have the same setlist, the performances are electrifying and fresh. Each of the shows are two CD sets that are packaged in gatefold miniature LP sleeves with similar colorful artwork. All three two disc sets are packaged in an attractive slipcase. Featuring 'Kill The King', 'Still I'm Sad', 'Catch The Rainbow' and more. 26 tracks total (two of the shows feature nine tracks, one show features eight). VAP. 2006."
