      "Presented by the Smithsonians National Museum of the American Indian. This anthology of hymns and songs from Native American communities throughout the United States demonstrates how music has helped to preserve and perpetuate Native languages. Singers from the Southeast to the Plains and from the Southwest to Alaska and Hawaii demonstrate the dynamic interplay between language and faith, and show the importance placed on the singing of these songs in keeping alive the culture embodied in their Native languages."
