      "2019 release. Singer-songwriter Jamie Kimmett's talent for writing truth-fueled songs comes from a deeply personal place. His enthusiasm for sharing scripture and, ultimately, the hope that transformed his own life, spills over into his every interaction. Growing up in a small town in Scotland, he found faith while pursuing a music career in Los Angeles. But the soulful singer's journey wasn't a simple one. It was a radical conversion, the result of God's steady pursuit, like a father waiting for the return of his prodigal son. Through a series of divine appointments, Kimmett's heart was transformed to an all-encompassing love for Jesus, a love that's woven throughout his songs and performances offering a picture of a man completely changed by the love of Christ."
