      "Sophe Lux is an imaginative and daring pop band based in Portland, OR. The band's trademarks include well-crafted songwriting, provocative lyrics, commanding vocals and stylish pop-hooks. The band returns music to art-rock spectacle with whimsical and audacious aplomb. With bold theatrical gestures and scathing social and political commentary, the band has been seducing audiences for more than three years. Sophe Lux is cherished for the exuberant live performances including tongue-in-cheek Dadaist theatrics, fantastical sets, and lavish Victorian costumes. In their upcoming release, 'Waking the Mystics,' the band offers an exciting and unique sound: bejeweled theatrical rock, French Opera and quirky indie-pop interwoven with tightly-layered harmonies, Louis XIV harpsicords, looped Eno-inspired guitars and twisted carnival accordians. The music seems to cast a prism of early Kate Bush, David Bowie, Roxy Music and Freddie Mercury. The music of Sophe Lux covers an engaging world of literary invention. 'Marie-Antoinette Robot 2073' for example, is a rock opera in five parts. This song presents an imaginative commentary on how the age of technology alienates and erases identity, as seen through the eyes of a baroque robot struggling against an existential crisis. Another example, 'Target Market,' is a cunning attack on the relationship between consumerism, possession, hypnosis and sleep juxtaposed against a Russian waltz beat. Sophe Lux appears with The Decemberists, Viva Voce and The Joggers on the OE Base complilation (compiled by Dave Allen of Gang of Four) showcasing the best bands of 2004. In 2006, the band's songwriter, Wendy Haynes, was awarded an ASCAP new songwriter award. Sophe Lux's radio appearances include KCRW in Los Angeles and KOOBA Radio in the United Kingdom. Locally, the band has appeared on KNRK, Oregon Public Broadcasting's Live Wire Radio and KBOO. PRESS: 'Intelligent rock stars seem to be a rarity these days which is why Sophe Lux should be relished and soaked up like the sun. Deliciously unraveling guitar and bass lines... A cocktail of Liz Phair, Tori Amos, and Cat Power.' -The Oregonian 'Sophe Lux: A rich blend of the world's finest indie legends.'-Sizzling CD's 'With thick, moody melodies, Sophe Lux places heavenly hypno-vocals over weighty rock like a drunken jazz singer in a fit of raging depression. These songs take lumbering swings at you in a mad, lovely, musical dance.'-Willamette Week 'All of my favorite feminist pop stars have been letting me down lately from Liz Phair's spectacular career suicide to Cat Power's contrived onstage meltdowns to PJ Harvey's tributes to greasy Vincent Gallo. None of these ladies seem to be able to keep it together, so you can imagine my joy when I discovered Sophe Lux. Wendy Haynes fronts a talented band that plays lush, brainy, girl positive pop. Dark but never veering into emo territory, Haynes's lyrics are intelligent and heartfelt. -Portland Mercury 'Haynes' lovely voice gives us strong, moving songs with lyrics that bite deep. It is fair to say that Sophe Lux is not your average band. Bless them.' -Anna Maria Stjarnell for Collected Sounds 'Sophe Lux is a moody rock band centered on one very talented woman. That woman is Wendy Haynes. A highly original songwriter in the vein of PJ Harvey and Cat Power. Her songs are dark, surreal narratives delivered with the lazy love-sick cadence of a woman who's been there and back.' -Willamette Week 'Hip-hopping Lifesavas headlined the house but too late. The buzz had already been stollen by Sophe Lux, fronted by Wendy Haynes, lyrical little sister of Oscar-coated film director Todd Haynes.' -Oregonian Living."
