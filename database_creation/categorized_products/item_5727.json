      "Laurel’s artistic spirit emerged as she began to make jewelry for herself and her friends. Gathering old coins, bones and beads, she hammered metal on the back of her kitchen skillet. Then her creations became beautiful adornments. Laurel Burch Jewelry embodies Laurel's unique art in a way that captures the romance and delight of the past with the trends of today. Retrospective, Classic, Sterling and Iconic Collections all represent the essence of Laurel's spirit and her enduring art while connecting to the human spirit. Our wish is for you to find joy in these magical collections."
