      "Ida Cox was one of the most talented of the classic blues singers of the 1920s. With her distinctive and very appealing voice, she was one of the few blues moaners who could sing on the same artistic level as Bessie Smith, as a matter a fact many of Cox's recordings have more bite to them then Smith's. This Document CD has 24 of her first 32 recordings and, although one regrets that it is not a \"complete\" series, the music is consistently enjoyable and timeless. In fact, quite a few of the lyrics (many of which were written by Cox) were later permanently \"borrowed\" by Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams; the first stanza of \"Goin' to Chicago\" was taken from \"Chicago Monkey Man Blues\" and \"Bear-Mash Blues\" has a couple of Williams' best lines. When one considers that the music on this CD is taken from 1923-24, it can certainly be considered ahead of it's time! Most of the musicians backing Ida Cox are excellent, particularly pianist Lovie Austin and (on five numbers) cornetist Tommy Ladnier and clarinettist Jimmy O'Bryant. The recording quality (even with some surface noise) has been greatly cleaned up for this reissue and Cox's singing is very easy to understand. Although uncrowned, Ida Cox (who after retiring in 1945 came back for a final recording in 1961) Cox communicates to todays listeners just as well as she did in the 20's. One can clearly hear and understand every word she says; so bluesy and down to earth. If you like a blues singer who can sing jazz and swing, you will enjoy Ida Cox, and if you like Bessie Smith you will also appreciate Cox's work. There are three other volumes in this series that reissue all of Cox's recordings and they are all highly recommended."
