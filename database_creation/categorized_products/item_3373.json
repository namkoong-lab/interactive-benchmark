      "It’s all in the details with this all new beauty. Inspired by virtual building blocks, our designers couldn’t resist bringing a playful and creative approach to the midsole of the Vogel 9000. The print design of the soft and deconstructed upper echoes the building blocks concept. Accented with either metallics or color pops, these sneakers make a statement.",
      "Saucony is among the most respected names in running shoes. They offer a wide range of running and walking shoes, each with the Saucony trademark fit, feel, and performance. They've spent years studying the biomechanics of top athletes because the goal is to develop creatively engineered systems that maximize your performance, allowing you to focus on the activity instead of the equipment. From studies have come many innovative Saucony concepts. Advanced technologies like Grid, the first sole-based stability and cushioning system, provide an advantage to athletes of all types."
