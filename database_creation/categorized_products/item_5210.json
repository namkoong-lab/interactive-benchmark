      "These basket set studs including the post and backings are made of solid 14k gold, featuring high quality cubic zirconia stones. Our cubic zirconia is bright and clear with an unmatched sparkle, so it will easily convince others it's the real thing.Choosing Earring SizeUnsure what size earrings to buy? 5mm (1ctw) is the perfect size that will look great on most people. If you are purchasing earrings for secondary ear piercings, we would recommend the 3mm size. Sizes larger than 5mm are great statement earrings, and sizes smaller than 3mm are perfect for a second hole piercing, fora cartilage piercing, or when you want just a hint of shine.About GoldPure gold (24 karat) is a very soft metal. In order to make it into durable jewelry you can wear everyday, it is mixed with other metals to add strength. The most popular alloy of gold is 14K gold, which is 58.5% pure gold and 41.5% other metals like silver and copper. Adding other metals to gold also allows us to make beautiful gold variations like white and rose gold.Gold Jewelry CareTo clean your gold jewelry, soak it in a bowl of mild liquid detergent and lukewarm water. Then rinse with water and dry with a soft cloth. Be careful not to bend any prongs while cleaning, as this could loosen stones from their settings. We recommend storing your gold jewelry individually wrapped in soft cloth to protect it from being scratched."
