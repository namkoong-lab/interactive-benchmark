      "Product Description",
      "Jamey is the co-writer of the CMA and ACM 2007 Song of the Year \"Give It Away,\" recorded by George Strait. Trace Adkins and George Jones have also recorded his songs but Jamey is not content with just providing hits for others, this singer/songwriter has a powerful drive to sing, record and perform. Following a deep period of introspection, Jamey Johnson entered the recording studio in April 2007 and emerged with THAT LONESOME SONG, a collection of extraordinary compositions that is equally noteworthy for it's lyrical craftsmanship and it's strikingly original sound.",

      "The final cut on",
      "That Lonesome Song",
      "—kind of a concept album meets musical manifesto—is titled \"Between Jennings and Jones,\" which is where Jamey Johnson finds himself shelved in the CD racks, and also how he describes his sound. Actually, there's way more Jennings than Jones, with two cuts covered from Waylon's classic",
      "Dreaming My Dreams",
      "(the title track and \"The Door Is Always Open\"), another paying tribute to him by name (\"The Last Cowboy\") and several others borrowing liberally from his sound. Yet in terms of both concept and sound, the bare-bones intimacy of this bittersweet divorce album remind more of Willie Nelson's",
      "Phases and Stages",
      "(at least side one, the man's side), with the opening \"High Cost of Living\" (\"ain’t nothing like the cost of living high\") setting the \"Bloody Mary Morning\" tone, extended by the sad country waltz of \"Angel\" and continuing through the down-and-out epiphany of the title track. Only the comparatively lightweight novelty of \"Women\" indicates that this is the same guy who wrote \"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\" for Trace Adkins.",
      "--Don McLeese",
      "About the Artist",
      "Jamey is a study in contrasts. He was raised in a devout household, yet he spent part of his youth drinking and playing country songs at night on the Montgomery tombstone of Hank Williams. He has a backwoods upbringing, but is a formally trained musician who knew music theory as early as junior high school. He is deadly serious about his music, yet has an outrageous sense of humor. With his piercing pale-blue eyes and biker beard, he looks like a hell raiser, but he has the heart of a poet.",
      "He seems like a rebel, but Jamey spent eight years as a member of the highly disciplined U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. After which Jamey Johnson was in Nashville trying to launch a country career. He arrived on Jan. 1, 2000, spending every dime he had to make the move. He took a job as a salesman for a sign company, and then worked for an industrial pumping company. In 2001-2004 he ran his own successful construction firm, restoring buildings devastated by fires, hurricanes or tornados.",
      "Performing in Nashville nightspots led to work singing songwriters' \"demo\" tapes on Music Row. Producer Buddy Cannon was impressed with Jamey's soulful singing, as well as the direct honesty of his songwriting.",
      "Those efforts paid off with a label deal and Jamey's hit single \"The Dollar\" in 2005. He hit the road - and the honky-tonks - with relish. As a consequence, Jamey acquired the reputation of being a country-music \"bad boy.\" Rumors and speculation flew, exaggerating his escapades. He admits he was a little wild, but emphasizes that he always delivered the goods, professionally. During this time, he and his wife separated, then divorced. In addition, his former record company's enthusiasm cooled and he lost his recording contract.",
      "\"I turned into a recluse for about a year. I wouldn't talk to anybody. I wouldn't go out to clubs. I didn't want to be at any party. I quit drinking for more than a year. In that respect, losing my deal was a good thing. Because I finally had time to come home and get my life back in order. More than anything, I stayed home and just sat there dwelling on things. It takes an awful lot of thinking to get through something like a divorce.\"",
      "\"The thing that really carried me through all of that was the writing success. Trace Adkins and George Strait kept money in my bank account and kept my name out there.",
      "When he began to work on That Lonesome Song, Jamey says he felt a renewed sense of purpose and freedom. \"Nobody was watching. We didn't use a lot of the automation gadgetry. We spent so much time on the mix, just making sure you could hear every foot patting the floor, every creak of the chair. If someone turned around to adjust an amp, I wanted to hear their back pop. If their knuckles cracked, I wanted to hear it all.\"",
