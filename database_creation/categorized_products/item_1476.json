      "Perfect leg protection with magnetotherapy action. Magnetotherapy is a medical method that treats several pathologies in human and animals, exploiting magnetic fields. The magnetic fields favour and facilitate lymphatic and blood microcirculation, the change and use of nutrient substances by the cells, the natural biological defence system and the elimination fo metabolic waste matter. Moreover, the magnetic fields provide significant benefits in all inflammatory processes which are often accompanied by pain. The benefit is obtained through a reduction of the inflammatory process and, at the same time, an analgetic action with respect to the tissue nerve fibres. The Magnetic Stable Boots EVO are made of breathable HCL foam AEROX. Internal padding in DFD (dry fast dry), interchangeable and fixed with hook and loop fastener. Lower protection in polyurethane to reduce contact wear. hook and loop fastener straps with elastic support to improve comfort and fit. Available in the sizes S, M, L. Color: black-blue.
