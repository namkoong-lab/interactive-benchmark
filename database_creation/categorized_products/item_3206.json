      "The pinnacle of ryka performance, this training shoe features the new rzx technology platform. Rzx innovates to provide both flexibility and cushioning in a training shoe – she no longer has to decide between the two. Featuring ultra flex in the forefoot, the alternating flex grooves on the top and bottom of the midsole, and in the rubber outsole, rzx reduces forefoot pressure during workouts. Rzx features re-zorb® in the heel, designed to absorb impact and provide cushion all the way to the flex zone, creating the ultimate experience for her feet, and freeing her mind to focus on the workout. A supportive and breathable upper provides support and allows for flexibility in all the right areas."
