      "PVC ceiling tiles come in 24\"x24\" size. Feather-light, easy to install, easy to clean, stain resistant, water resistant, dust free, and easy to cut. They can be cut with any house hold scissors. Can be installed in the ordinary suspended ceiling - just pop them in or glue or nail them to a regular ceiling (sheetrock, stucco, wood, etc...). The material that they are made out of is fire rated. The paint/finish of the tiles may change the fire rating and properties of the tiles. Elegant, regal, and absolutely stunning in their simple classic beauty, these ceiling tiles add stature and grace to any room. Combining the character and charm of traditional pressed metal with the convenience and safety of vinyl, these panels are in a class all by themselves. - Designed to fit all standard 1\" T-bar ceilings - Matching paint is available at any Home Depot which enables finishing the grid to match the tile. Please contact us for more info."
