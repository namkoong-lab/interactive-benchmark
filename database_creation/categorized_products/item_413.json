      "After performing live in December of 2000 before 3.4 million people in Lagos, Nigeria, almost the population of his native Puerto Rico, Adlan feels he has fulfilled a dream which consists of visiting every continent of the world by sharing his music. He was born on Thanksgiving day, 1968 and by the age of three he began to play the piano by ear. His inclination for classical music and his passion for the piano inspired him, two years later, to pursue and master his talent. His technique was cultivated by two of the most prominent concert pianists in the western hemisphere, Rosita Casanova and Violeta de la Mata. The year 1985 marked Adlan's life when he was selected to represent his country in Spain at the Fifth Centennial Celebration of the Discovery of America where they recorded his piano recitals and was played over twenty countries. One year later he was awarded finest pianist of his graduating class the medal for Highest Honor, granted by the Ernesto Ramos Antonini School of Music back in his homeland. In 1988 he was featured with the Puerto Rico Chamber Orchestra at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center in San Juan, as a result of winning first place at the prestigious Jesús María Sanromá Piano Competition. In 1989 he composed and recorded the soundtrack for the motion picture \" The Dancer.\" That same year he released his first album on religious music entitled \" Instrument of Praise,\" which was nominated later on for the \"Tu Música\" Awards. This versatility opened a new opportunity for the next 5 years, to present a combined program throughout the churches and conert halls in Countries such as Holland, Spain, Brazil, Argentina and USA. Numerous symphony orchestras have invited Adlan to feature performances such as L.V. Beethoven's Second and Third Piano Concertos, S. Rachmanioff's romantic Concerto No.2 and G. Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. In 1993 he released his second recording named \" The Way for the Giver,\" inspired on Proverbs 18:16, being featured in talk shows such as CBN's 700 Club with Pat Robertson and in crusades with Billy Graham, Nicky Cruz and Ron Kenoly. Notable recording artists such as Abraham Laboriel, Justo Almario, Chester Thompson, David Sanchez, Jorge Laboy and Pepe Ojeda were involved in this project. In October of 1994 when thousands of Cuban refugees camped at the military bases in Panama, Adlan was invited to perform one of the nights where celebrities such as Gloria Estefan, Willy Chirino and Andy Garcia also participated.For his third CD in 1995 he envisioned one of his live piano recitals, this time including some of his own compositions. This album was called \"Adlan Live.\" As a result he traveled intensively throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. After the vast exposure to diverse cultures throughout the Globe, Adlan dedicated his efforts to combine his classically trained techniques with the ethnic rhythms of the various countries he has visited, hence giving birth to his latest CD baptized \"The Piano According to Adlan\". His openness to folkloric music prompted him to identify with his roots, hence incorporating vigorous Puerto Rican, Flamenco, AfroCuban and South American rhythms to his grand piano melodies."
