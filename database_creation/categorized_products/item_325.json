      "“A previously unissued, killer acid-ballroom blitz by the late H.P. Lovecraft, a sadly under regarded Chicago band caught in its trippy Gothic psych-rock prime at the Filmore West.” –Rolling Stone In case you hadn’t noticed, there weren’t a lot of people taking notes during the heyday of psychedelic concertdom. As a result, the lore and legend of that era consists of hazy, mumbled recollections of plankton- brained survivors. Well, rewrite the history books, because Sundazed archaeologist Jeff Jarema—in collaboration with Lovecraft honcho George Edwards—has excavated this remarkably well-preserved snapshot of Freakout Central from the birthplace of noodle-dancing, the Filmore Auditorium circa 1968."
