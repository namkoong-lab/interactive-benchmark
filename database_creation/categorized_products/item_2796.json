      "Olympia E: Glamour, style, class, beauty and pure sophistication: there are just way too many adjectives that apply to this absolutely stunning and unique woman's engagement ring. The timeless beauty and elegance of the Olympia centers on the 6mm, 1.30 carat Princess Cut Russian Ice on Fire CZ gemstone solitaire professionally hand set into a 4-prong setting. From the solitaire, an enticing and glamorous blend of alternating Simulated Emerald and Russian Ice on Fire CZ accent stones cascade down the shoulders of the engagement ring.   ABOUT RUSSIAN ICE ON FIRE CZ's:   Russian Ice on Fire CZ's, Russian Ice CZ's or Ice on Fire CZ's are top-of-the-line created gemstones of exceptional quality and are the trademarked property of Trustmark Group, LLC, c. 2006-2015, all rights reserved. They are of far higher quality than the standard or typical CZ's used by most other companies and are designed to replicate the fire, sparkle, clarity and cut quality of top-grade Diamonds. While other lower cost products and technologies do exist, they do not meet our standards for quality, fire, clarity and durability. 1000 Jewels is a member of the Trustmark Group family of companies.   PRODUCT CARE:   Your Russian Ice on Fire CZ's need to be properly cared for in order to maintain their original fire, brilliance and shine. Clean with warm water, mild soap and a soft brush, rinse thoroughly, then immediately dry with a clean, soft cloth. Avoid contact with perfumes, body lotions, conditioners, hairsprays or any other chemicals that may coat, dull or otherwise damage their original shine. Store your jewelry items in a soft cloth pouch or jewelry case so they do not touch other pieces in your collection. As with all gemstone-set jewelry items, normal wear and tear can loosen prongs and settings. As such, we recommend having your jewelry regularly checked, inspected and cleaned by a jeweler."
