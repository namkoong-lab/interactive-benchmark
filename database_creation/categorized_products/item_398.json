      "L Is For Lover as Al Jarreau recently described to us is one of those albums that his international audience knows every song, the track order, the lyrics, who played on the album, etc. In other words, this 1986 masterwork is truly a fan favorite. This Nile Rodgers (David Bowie/ Madonna) produced gem included some incredibly strong material with hits like Tell Me What I Gotta Do, L Is For Lover & stellar album cuts. This new deluxe edition now features 3 bonus tracks including his #1 smash MOONLIGHTING! New liner interview notes from Al Jarreau + original artwork elements /new remastering."
