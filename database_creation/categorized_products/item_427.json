      "Vincenzo Maltempo continues to establish himself not only as an Alkan champion with his fifth Alkan CD but also as a pianist of extraordinary power, sensitivity and intellect. This recital presents some of the composers quirky and eccentric works, not necessarily of epic proportions but rather on a small scale, concentrating manically on a single idea, creating a hallucinatory and mesmerizing effect (or simply hilarious...). Maltempos previous Alkan Piano Classics recordings received rave reviews in the international press, including 5-star reviews in Diapason and Piano News."
