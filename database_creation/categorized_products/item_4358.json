      "The Women's Training Bib Shorts feature a host of MK's fabric technologies and have an ergonomic fit that sits perfectly when in a riding position.You'll find side panels use a polyamide fabric, with a controlled elasticity, to give compressive muscle support and total freedom of movement.To the upper body, the bibs are high stretch and again tailored to fit perfectly when in a riding position, so much so you'll barely notice them there when riding. The 50mm Leg Stability System at the leg ends features a deep elastic leg band with silicon woven in the structure that keeps the legs in place and distributes pressure on the leg firmly and evenly, without any fear of bulging."
