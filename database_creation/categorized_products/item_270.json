      "typifies his no-nonsense, reformed approach to opera. There are no wasted notes, no explosive high passages, no coloratura; in short, other than stark drama and beautiful, expressive, exclamatory music and singing, very little for a voice-loving opera fan to sink his or her teeth into. That said, this new set--the first recording of Gluck's Italian version of the work--will fill the bill somewhat if it's",
      "Alceste",
      "you're after. Teresa Ringholz is good in the title role, but she seems to understate the part; a bit more high drama would not have been out of place. Justin Lavendar is effective as her hubby, although he, too, has a very light voice. This undercasting may have been on purpose; it's Arnold Ostman with his Drottningholm forces on period instruments, and the entire scale of the show is therefore slight. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating if rigid work, and this recording is a good way to get to know it.",
