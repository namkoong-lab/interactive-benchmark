      "How to train your naughty puppy? When the dog has bad behaviours,you can use our ultrasonic training device to improve it,simply press and hold for 10s towards him (within 16.4ft), or switch to Variable Frequency (“Ⅱ”) when the dog doesn't respond to it. In order to achieve the desired results, once your dog accepts the ultrasonic bark controller correction and stops barking, you can give the pet appropriate rewards, such as snacks, petting, etc., to actively guide and strengthen the dog's memory. The dog will eventually learn to associate the barking with the ultrasound, forming a conditioned reflex and will stop barking this behavior. (Tips: Consistent training and appropriate rewards are required to achieve the desired result.) Important Notes: 1. The product may not be effective on dogs with hearing problems. 2. We DO NOT recommend it for use on dogs under 6 months or over 8 years and also the aggressive dogs. 3. Only training one dog with this device will be better. 4. In order to achieve long-lasting results, please be patient and consistently use the product as a training aid, along with commands and positive reinforcement."
