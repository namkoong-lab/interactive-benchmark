    "description": [
      "Serious athletes are unique in that they intentionally subject their bodies to incredible amounts of stress with training and cardio. Over time, the immune system can be compromised, and muscles, tendons, and ligaments take longer to recover which means you can't train them as often as you would like. A deficiency can mean that you aren't getting optimal results from your training. Designed for the serious athlete, ORANGE TRIad + Greens combines the most proven and effective vitamins, minerals, and nutrients for supporting optimal DIGESTION, IMMUNE system, and JOINT HEALTH into one \"twice daily\" dietary supplement. The JOINT and FLEX complexes help lubricate joints and cartilage as well as increase the resiliency of connective tissue, while the DIGESTION and IMMUNE complex includes natural anti-inflammatories, digestive aids, and nutrient partitioning agents to take your performance to the next level. The GREENS complexes are geared towards real athletes. The \"Cardiovascular Complex\" is full of vegetables that have been shown to increase endurance and cardiovascular health in exercising humans. The enzyme, probiotic and anti-oxidant blends will help the body absorb and utilize the highest level of nutrients from your diet and supplementation for maximum results. Not only is Orange TRIad + Greens healthful, but it tastes amazing too without the use of artificial colors or sweeteners."
