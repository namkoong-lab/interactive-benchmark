      "A Kotobukiya Japanese import. You've been asking for it and now \"Chop Sabers\" are back by popular demand. The first and second series of Star Wars Lightsaber Chopsticks were such hits that Kotobukiya is proud to announce an all new series three featuring high quality chopsticks recreating the iconic Jedi and Sith weapons from the Star Wars films. Headlining this new three-part series are COUNT DOOKU LIGHTSABER CHOPSTICKS. Suitable for eating sushi or defending the galaxy, the chopsticks' red lightsaber blades are cast in translucent material. Each 9 inch long miniature replica of Count Dooku's red lightsabers from his scenes in Episodes II and III are intricately sculpted and detailed. Fully safety tested and colorful and exciting, lightsaber chopsticks are fun for the whole family. And Count Dooku's go great with the other new versions: Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi."
