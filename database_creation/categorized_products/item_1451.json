      "Keep Your Furry Friend Snuggly and Warm – Even In The Worst Days of Winter A dog coat is an essential piece of equipment for all dog owners in cold climates, but a coat doesn't protect your dog's sensitive ears and head. When you are seriously cold, a coat isn't enough. You need a hat. When your dog is cold, he needs a dog snood. This snood is made from thick, insulated fabric that will keep your dog toasty warm – even on the coldest days of the year. It provides the warmth and the coverage that a dog coat can't. Soft And Comfortable – So Your Dog Won't Mind Wearing It The fabric isn't just warm, it's also incredibly soft. It has been specifically chosen not to irritate your dog's fur or skin. Even the fussiest dogs can tolerate it, and some dogs even love wearing it. It slips on easily, and you can tighten it gently around the head and neck. Your dog can't shake it off or remove it with his paws. It also won't get in the way of a collar or lead. Durable And Made To Last This snood washes incredibly well and dries quickly. It's extremely durable, so you can be confident it will last for years to come. It has no easily broken catches, clips, Velcro or buttons. It's suitable for all breeds of dog, and comes in six different sizes. Just measure around your dog's head at the widest point and look at the attached size chart to find the perfect size for your canine companion. Keep your dog warm, this winter and every winter. Pick up the Euro Dog Designs Alaska Fleece Snood today. Size Information: Please choose size carefully (6 sizes to choose from, choose by circumference of neck) Size XS is for neckline of 12\" or 30cm Size S is for neckline of 14\" or 35cm Size M is for neckline of 16\" or 40cm Size L is for neckline of 18\" or 45cm Size XL is for neckline of 20\" or 50cm Size XXL is for neckline of 22\" or 55c"
