      "Aurabeam Economy Lamps are made with the same specs as your original bulb. Our housing units are made from durable and high-quality plastic guaranteed to fit properly. Aurabeam Economy lamps have an average expected life of 3,000 hours. Lamp life is affected by temperature, altitude, air pressure, humidity, and physical impact. Help extend lamp life by making sure the air intake and/or exhaust vent is not blocked during operation. This is our economic option. For a longer lifespan and even brighter picture we recommend our Professional line. Original Philips, Osram, Phoenix, Ushio. Keep the exhaust vent at least 2 feet from a wall or any object. Clean the projector's air intake filter every three to six months depending on the frequency of operation. If provided, use the \"economy mode\" when operating the projector. Please contact our customer service staff if you were to have questions, concerns, or any issues with your purchase. We are here to help and assist to ensure your shopping experience is always a positive one."
