      "Deluxe two CD edition issue of the Maddie Original London Cast Recording. This release celebrates the 20th Anniversary of Maddie and continues Stage Door's commitment to preserve 'lost' British theatre scores of the past 50 years. Maddie opened at London's Lyric Theatre on September 29th 1997 - the musical which had been in development for nearly eight years was based on the Jack Finney novel Marion's Wall (adapted as the 1986 film Maxie) and featured music by Stephen Keeling, lyrics by Shaun McKenna and book by McKenna and Steven Dexter."
