      "With a variety of fragrances to choose from in our GONESH GOLD Extra Rich and Classic lines, you can find the perfect fit for any situation.About our Incense:Gonesh continually strives to elevate the level of fragrance delivery by working with creative and skilled perfumers, by using the highest quality raw materials, and by our exclusive use of High Charcoal. Unlike wood powder, charcoal produces no smoke- allowing the fragrant oil to vaporize and the scent to come through without smoke. Gonesh Incense has the highest charcoal content of any brand currently on the market - it delivers the purest, cleanest burn, and crystal clear fragrances. We dip our incense by hand to guarantee maximum fragrance absorption. So our fragrance lasts longer on the sticks than incense that has been sprayed with oil.About our Company:We're out to change the image of incense in America. By making our incense in the bustling city of Chicago, we can guarantee that our incense is high quality, ethically sourced and environmentally responsible. Today Genieco's Gonesh brand includes a variety of \"green\" and Earth-friendly practices, including a recent installation of Solar Panels on our warehouse rooftop. We take great pride in supporting green energy and do our part in reducing our carbon footprint.DIRECTIONS: Hold a lighted match to the coated end of a stick until it glows; blow out flame. Place sticks in an incense holder, a flowerpot, or a glass filled with salt, sand or earth. Be sure that the ashes fall on a fireproof surface.WARNING: Keep burning stick away from flammable articles such as papers, drapes, etc. Do not allow sticks to touch any varnished, painted, plastic, etc. surfaces. Never leave burning incense unattended."
