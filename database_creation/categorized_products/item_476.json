      "Hailing from both the UK and US, Black Music Disaster is a super indie group featuring Spiritualized's legendary J Spaceman, Spring Heel Jack's musical genius John Coxon, and acclaimed jazz icon Matthew Shipp. The pace is set with the pulsating Farfisa organ, complimented by dueling psychedelic guitars and rounded out with explosive drums. At times hypnotic, yet rapidly moving with wide dynamic sweeps, this sonic experience is unmatched in it's ultimate musical journey. Given these great musicians span such diverse musical backgrounds the brilliance here is how the genres just melt away."
