      "Each year we grow a giant garden of our favorite vegetables. Most of our favorite vegetables are old time varieties that people currently call “Heirloom”. It is with great pleasure that we offer up our favorites for you. Pepper Description: The original strain of Sandia (Hot) was first released by Dr. Harper in 1956, then known as Sandia A, and officially known as Sandia as of 1967. Sandia had a heat level of between 1,500-2,000, as measured by Scoville Heat Units when first released, though today we see it’s heat profile running a fair bit hotter than that. It is consistently hot and spicy, without being too overpowering.   Unlike others, we do not buy seeds from outside sources. Our plants are hand grown with tender loving care. Your purchase helps us to continue our quest to organically produce premium seeds here on our farm. We are passionate about gardening and strive to present nothing but the best for our fellow gardeners. The pictures you see are actual sample photos of peppers we grew. There are 10 seeds per pack   We guarantee germination for this current year or your money back. Seeds must be stored in a cool dry area.   Photos are expressed property of Sherwoods Seeds. Usage without consent will result in DMCA action."
