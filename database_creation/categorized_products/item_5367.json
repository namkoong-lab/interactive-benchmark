      "As the yearly floods brought life to Egypt, so did the holy symbol of the ankh. Because of it's prosperity of giving eternal life, the ankh was originally worn by the pharaoh God-Kings of Egypt. It is said that the ankh is the symbol of the union of Isis and Osiris; the cross of Osiris merging with the fertile oval of Isis."
