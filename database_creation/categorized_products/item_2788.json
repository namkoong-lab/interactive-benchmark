      "Bend ‘em, flex ‘em, you can’t break ‘em! Do you have an active child who spends a lot of time outdoors, or does your family enjoy doing things like going to the beach or taking long walks through the park? Then your little one needs our Adventure sunglasses.",
      "The unbreakable, flex fit, wrap around frame minimizes exposure to peripheral light while the soft, adjustable strap ensures these glasses will be comfortable and stay put no matter what. The shatterproof Polycarbonate lenses are lightweight while providing excellent impact resistance and optical clarity.",
      "Why 100% UVA/UVB Protection?",
      "Think of it as sunscreen for the eyes. Children’s eyes are more sensitive and have a higher risk of permanent sun damage than grownups, but not all sunglasses provide the proper protection. As with skin, sun damage is cumulative, irreparable and can happen any time of year.",
      "Our quality children’s sunglasses provide full spectrum UV protection, meaning both 100% UVA and UVB protection,",
      "so that your little one’s eyes are protected from the sun’s damaging rays every day.",
      "Protecting your children is our top priority.",
      "Available with Polarized Lenses (Optional)",
      "Our Adventure sunglasses are available with a high quality polarized lens we call P2 (Polarized + Polycarbonate).",
      "Polarized lenses eliminate glare, increase visual clarity, reduce eye strain and enhance contrast.",
      "These lenses are especially advantageous to combat intense glare experienced on the water or on the snow.  Don’t need Polarized lenses? No problem! Our regular lenses also feature shatterproof Polycarbonate and provide just as much protection. You can choose which one you prefer above under Sizing."
