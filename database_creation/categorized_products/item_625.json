      "Product Description",
      "Ondine is pleased to announce the first chamber music recording with internationally acclaimed violinist Christian Tetzlaff, featuring his long time musical partner pianist Lars Vogt. The selection of these sonatas for piano and violin by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart demonstrate distinctly the composer's ingeniousness and show a wide range and strong ambiguity of emotions.",
