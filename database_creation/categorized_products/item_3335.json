    "description": [
      "A rebozo is a traditional Mexican cloth which looks like a cross between a scarf and a shawl. Like ponchos, huipils and sarapes they are classic Mexican garments. A rebozo is long enough to wrap around a woman's body and can be used in pregnancy and labour by midwives, doulas and support people as a comfort measure and to encourage babies into an optional position. Because of the nature of the garment, especially the fringes, they should be hand washed. The dye may or may not be colorfast so mild soap should be used"
