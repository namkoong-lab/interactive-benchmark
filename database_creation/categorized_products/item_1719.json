      "TELEPHOTO 35-100mm / F2.8: With an ultra-long range of 35–100mm (35mm camera equivalent: 70–200mm) at a high-speed F2.8, this lens lets you softly blur the background for portraits and close-ups. And it delivers high shutter speeds to freeze-frame fast-moving subjects such as action and sports.",
      "SPLASH / DUST / FREEZEPROOF: This lens features a splash/dust/freezeproof construction that is tough enough to withstand even heavy field use. It protects the lens system inside from sand, rain and more, making it perfect for shooting under harsh conditions.",
      "VIDEO SUPPORT: With video support any user has everything they need for recording with their LUMIX camera. Not only does it perform smooth aperture changes so there are no sudden jumps in exposure, it also boasts a silent design for enhanced capture of the scene’s audio. What’s more, the stunning AF performance of this lens records excellent 4K video, where precise focusing is essential.",
      "POWER O.I.S. The optical image stabilization (O.I.S.) technology built directly into the lens ensures your photos will look great, with sharp blur-free contours across the entire picture. This advanced technology immediately compensates even large camera shake and vibrations that may occur in photography. So you can capture true-to-life scenes without the need for a tripod. WARRANTY: Panasonic Authorized Reseller. Includes a Panasonic 1 Year USA Warranty, Extendable to 3-Years"
