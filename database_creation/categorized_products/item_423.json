      "Product Description",
      "Legendary recording artist Jimmie Spheeris released 4 albums in the 1970s that became staples of the \"underground\" FM radio from that era. Tragically killed by a drunk driver in 1984, Jimmies music fell out of print until 1998, when a groundbreaking effort by thousands of online fans made a CD reissue of Jimmies catalog possible through Rain Records and Sony Music.",
      "Rain Records is proud to announce the release of this new LIVE Double CD, originally recorded in concert at Willimantic, Connecticut, in 1976. The package design features a unique \"mini-poster\" insert that unfolds to reveal rare photos of Jimmie and the band, plus extensive liner notes by Johnny Pierce, executive producer of the project and Jimmies bass player on the album.",
      "Longtime fans and a new generation of awakened listener can now experience the magic of a Jimmie Spheeris concert as if they're sitting front row center.",
      "About the Artist",
      "JIMMIE SPHEERIS was a circus kid. His mother and father owned and operated a roving carnival called the Majick Empire. His early years were spent moving from town to town \"living like gypsies\", as he often put it. And when you listen to his music you can hear the inspiration from those early years of colorful transience.",
      "After the death of his father (shot by a belligerent carnival-goer), Jimmies family eventually settled in Southern California, where he won his first guitar in a music contest in school at the age of 14. And although Jimmies teachers were in awe of his abundant talent, they kicked him out of school for his long hair. Afterwards and long before musical success, Jimmie used to assemble kaleidoscopes with longtime friend Jackson Browne - as Jimmie said, \"so we could make enough money to go to San Francisco to be hippies.\"",
      "In the late 60s, Jimmie moved to New York City and lived in heart of its creative haven, The Village. He quickly became friends with Ritchie Havens and other folk rock performers and spent several years developing his songwriting and musical style within that highly artistic atmosphere. It was there that Jimmie was signed to his first record contract with Columbia Records by legendary music man Clive Davis in 1970. In 1971 his first album \"Isle Of View\" was released and quickly became popular with early underground rock stations. Jimmie will always be remembered as one of the staples of progressive-rock radio. Throughout the 70s his song \"I Am The Mercury\" was always in heavy rotation at those early underground stations.",
      "Jimmies second album \"The Original Tap Dancing Kid\" was produced by Felix Cavilar, lead singer (and Hammond B-3 wizard) with the \"Rascals\". Released in 1972, and as with \"Isle Of View\", this album was recorded in New York City. Although this album was a bit more polished than his first, Jimmies songwriting was rapidly evolving - with songs like \"Moon On The Water\" and \"Streets Of The Harbour\" it was undeniable that Jimmie Spheeris was one of the most innovative artists of his day.",
      "By the time he released his third (and some say his most magical) album in 1975, \"The Dragon Is Dancing\", Jimmie Spheeris had evolved his style into a very colorful dark mystical place. His lyrics had become more introspective - it is in this album he sings of his childhood carnival days and the darker side of humanity. This album was produced in Los Angeles by legendary producer, Henry Lewy. While recording this album it was not unusual for Jimmies friends, Joni Mitchell and Peggy Lee to show up at the studio. This was a very exciting time in Jimmies life with a new record label (Epic) and a new manager and a new place to call home, where he would spend the rest of his days - Venice Beach.",
      "To Jimmie, living in Venice Beach was like coming home. The carnival-like atmosphere reminded him of his youth on the road with the circus. And Jimmie fit right in with the wild street characters, the seedy bars and the ocean. It was in Venice Jimmie began writing the songs which would become his fourth album, \"Ports Of The Heart\". Also, this was a time of much touring and during one of his one-niters, Jimmie fell head over heels in love with the city of New Orleans. Again, it was like he had found a second home - another place that seemed to practice the carnival-like lifestyle he was accustomed to. You can hear the influence of Venice and New Orleans in this album. Released in 1976 and produced by his longtime friend from the \"Isle Of View\" album, David Campbell, \"Ports Of The Heart\" was full of hope and future.",
      "After touring a few years with The Moody Blues and right before the release of his fifth (still unreleased) album, Jimmie Spheeris was killed on July 4, 1984 in Venice Beach by a drunk driver. On that day, the world lost one of its truest musical clowns. Jimmie knew why he was here - his purpose was to make us laugh, cry, feel and maybe see that our lives can be much more than the dreary lives we are taught to live - that there are wonderful universes out there for the taking. There will never be anyone quite like him - long lanky legs, baggy pants, mystical, abundantly aesthetic, charismatic, a true carnie, a true artist - and probably the most magical singer/songwriter of our time.",
