        "Evenflo Vented + Bottles and Proflo Vented Nipples provide a complete line of feeding solutions for your baby's changing needs. Delivering a twist on an iconic classic, The Evenflo Vented + Polypropylene Bottles feature classic styling with an ergonomic shape. These uniquely shaped are paired with patented Proflo Venting Technology. Expertly designed for easy assembly and leak-free feeding, the simple, one-piece integrated nipple and vent system means no extra parts to clean or lose. These soft silicone nipples rapidly vent, directing air bubbles into the bottle, not baby's tummy, which significantly reduces gas, colic, and fussiness. To help take the guesswork out of feeding your little one the Vented + Polypropylene Bottles feature molded measurement markers in both ounces and milliliters to provide an easy and accurate way to measure the volume of liquids without the risk of the measurements washing off. The unique shape, based on Evenflo's flagship design with a lightweight yet ergonomic twist, helps to make these bottles simple to hold, simple to use and simple to love. An added bonus is that these standard neck bottles fit many standard neck breast pumps so you can easily pump directly into the bottle for added convenience. Rest assured, our bottles are 100% free of polycarbonates, PVC and phthalates, and are also made of food grade material."
