        "Voted 2003 Book of the Year by Readers of ChessCafeJohn Watson fleshes out the theory presented to enormous acclaim in Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy and extends it into new areas. He illustrates the modern practice of chess with many examples from imaginative players such as Kasparov, Kramnik, Anand, Ivanchuk and tempestuous innovators such as Shirov and Morozevich. In Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy, Watson broke new ground by describing the developments in chess strategy since the time of Nimzowitsch. He explained how modern players are more willing than their predecessors to favour dynamic considerations over static ones, and how they have increasingly transcended the limiting 'rules' which influenced play in earlier times. The dominant results of Garry Kasparov and the rise of a new generation of supergrandmasters testify to the effectiveness of this dynamic and open-minded philosophy which has enriched modern chess. Those who enjoyed Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy will welcome the clarification of important concepts. Chess Strategy in Action can also be read on its own as an outstanding collection of modern games with thoughtful and enlightening annotations.\"a companion volume ... every bit as good as its predecessor. In the first part it covers concepts which were neglected in the earlier work; in the second, it gives examples from play. The book is well structured and packed with erudition\" - GM Nigel Short, The Sunday TelegraphInternational Master John Watson is one of the world's most respected writers on chess. His groundbreaking four-volume work on the English firmly established his reputation in the 1980s, and he has produced a string of top-quality works since. In 1999, Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy, Watson's first book for Gambit, won the British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award and the United States Chess Federation Fred Cramer Award for Best Book. His pupils include the 1997 World Junior Champion, Tal Shaked.\" John Watson's particular talent lies in his ability to sift material to show distinct patterns and demonstrate trends in the way the modern game is played. Like the conductor of an orchestra, he brings together the work of virtuoso players and commentators to illustrate a common theme.\" - John Saunders, British Chess Magazine"
