        "For almost fifty years the beloved 60s sitcom Bewitched has been enchanting television audiences. Created at a turbulent time in American history, Bewitched offered a brief respite from the worries of the day. Before now, there has never been a book written that ties in the events of the times with each episode. But more important, there has never been a book about the show which breaks down each episode in depth. You lucky reader! You are about to read The Omni-Directional Three-Dimensional Vectoring Paper Printed Omnibus for Bewitched Analysis a.k.a. The Bewitched History Book! Within these pages you will learn everything about America's favorite witch, Samantha Stephens, her dreary mortal husband, Durwood, er, Darrin, and the grand host of witches, warlocks, and marvelous mortals who accompanied them on their journey as newlyweds to the parents of a little witch and warlock of their own. Each of the 254 episodes are described in humorous detail and reviewed by one of the biggest fans of the show, David Pierce (a.k.a. Dr. Bombay), from the premiere Bewitched website www.harpiesbizarre.com, based on his popular \"40 Years Ago...\" weekly posts. Rare trivia and photos accompany the episodes as you learn which witch went which way along with what mortal madness materialized in the swinging 60s of suburbia!"
