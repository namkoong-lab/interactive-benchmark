        "Awakening the Luminous Mind",
        ", meditation teacher Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche guides you to find refuge within instead of searching for support outside of yourself. Using the heart instructions of Dawa Gyaltsen, an 8th-century Tibetan meditation master, as a vehicle to guide contemplative practice, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche opens your eyes to the gifts hidden in your ordinary experiences. The meditations presented in the book and on the accompanying audio download provide a direct way to meet the challenges of life as we encounter them. Fully incorporating these practices into daily life will help you open and transform your perceived limitations into unlimited possibilities. They will help you dissolve self-doubt and self-judgment, and discover the wisdom and light inherent within you in every moment.",

        "completes a series of three books that present meditation instructions and practices to help readers discover the treasury of the natural mind."
