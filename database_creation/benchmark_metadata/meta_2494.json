        "In this highly anticipated book, renowned mythologist and storyteller Michael Meade explores the complex and mysterious territories of the human soul with daring and hard-won wisdom. Drawing on folktales and myths from many cultures and spiritual ideas from the East and West, he leads us to an undeniable truth: that the only story we came here to live is our own. Meade shows how the limitations of family and fate form the inner threads from which our individual destiny must emerge. He explains how our wounds can become doorways to our deepest gifts, and how our greatest efforts in the world are intended to lead us to a treasure divinely seeded within us before birth. Fate and Destiny speaks directly to young people looking to find a genuine path in life and trying to awaken to the dream they carry inside. It offers penetrating insights for those caught in life s inevitable struggles and shows how the wisdom of elders depends upon re-membering the spirit of eternal youth. As one story puts it, god has only one question to ask you at the end of life: did you become yourself? Weaving stories within stories, lacing pertinent psychology within cultural analysis, and mixing autobiography with myth, Meade opens the territory of fate and destiny to new interpretations and deeper meanings."

        "Carefully re-teaching us words we think we know: genius, destiny, fate, soul, gift, fame and infamy Michael Meade introduces us to our own soul s interior meanings and our unique life s divinely imprinted designs. I love the threading of these teachings with stories from Meade s own remarkable life. It is a relief to witness the glory of an awakened elder, here. There is brilliant medicine in this book. --Alice Walker ~ Overcoming Speechlessness / The Color PurpleMichael Meade is one of our most brilliant and visionary teachers, and this profound book is a life-line to the soul. I truly hope your good fate brings you to read this book and be transformed by its wild blessings and wisdom. --Jack KornfieldAt the age of thirteen Michael became a lover of myth. That love kept unfolding. Now he is a great elder in our tribe, and this book is the flowering and the fruiting of the seed-story of this unique individual. His genius is a generous gift to us all. --Coleman Barks ~ Rumi: Bridge to the Soul / The Essential Rumi",
