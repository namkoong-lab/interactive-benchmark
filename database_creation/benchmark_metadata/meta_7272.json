        "Nestled along the banks of the mighty Mississippi, Riverview Plantation is a picture of southern charm and tranquility. But an embittered quest to right the wrongs of the past soon threatens to destroy the peace and security of all who dwell there. Melinda Cartwright is determined to help the Elliott brothers catch the smugglers that threaten their pecan operation. And John Elliott is just as determined to stop her! As John watches his older brother, his aunt, and even their house-guests fall in love with Melinda, and her winsome ways, he battles his own conflicting feelings for her. Melinda is not immune to his charms. But she denies her feelings, certain a future with John would mean the sacrifice of her dreams. Then Melinda makes a sacrifice of another kind. One that could cost her very life. Ultimately God intercedes to show them that only by trusting Him can they receive the true desire of their hearts."

        "About the Author",
        "About June Caedmon \"This instinct for love, so firmly implanted in the human heart, is the supreme way by which we learn to desire and love God himself above all else.\" So writes Hannah Hurnard in the preface to her allegory, Hinds' Feet on High Places. Hurnard's sentiment expresses most profoundly, why I write romantic fiction. Through these stories, I seek, first and foremost, to glorify God. I trust that the stories will also engage and entertain my readers. If a single person is brought closer to God through their reading experience, I will count myself blessed indeed. The author began writing under the pen name June Caedmon in July of 2002. Since then she has completed seven novels, four of which have been published. She is an avid reader and enjoys the research that her writing style demands. She has little with which to commend herself and relies solely on God for her inspiration, wisdom and guidance. The author lives with her family in the Hill Country of Texas."
