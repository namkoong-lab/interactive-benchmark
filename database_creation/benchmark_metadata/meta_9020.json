        "\"The book addresses all aspects of 84 disease states and disorders, from presentation and pathology to treatment and monitoring. Each chapter focuses on individual groups of medication considered for treatment and gives a concise overview of them in easy to see bulleted points. The qualities that I find especially useful are that charts and algorithms are easily identifiable and tables are shaded light gray for quick reference . . . Although this handbook contains an enormous amount of information, it conveniently fits into a lab coat pocket. It is an extremely useful reference.\" --",
