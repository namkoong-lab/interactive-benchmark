        "This item also fits additional vehicles. See Tech Specs below. The Mishimoto racing thermostat for the 2013+ Subaru BRZ will promote greater cooling efficiency in your stock or modified FA20. Once the engine is fully warmed up, the Mishimoto racing thermostat will open at a lower temperature than standard thermostats. This allows coolant to flow through the engine sooner, which reduces and maintains cooler engine temperatures. The Mishimoto Racing Low Temp Thermostat for Subaru BRZ 2013+ is the perfect addition to your street or track BRZ and is a direct replacement for the factory thermostat. As with all our products, this thermostat includes the Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty"
