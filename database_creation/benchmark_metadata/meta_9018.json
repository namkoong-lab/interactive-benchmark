        "Review",
        "This series is an excellent choice for fun with friends or for science experiments. The books appeal to girls with bright colored, flowery covers and pictures of girls and women. Each experiment has an introduction, a list of supplies, step-by-step directions with photos, and a follow-up paragraph explaining terms and how the experiment fits into science. While the experiments can be used by anyone, this set is most appropriate for upper elementary and lower middle level students. Recommended.-- \"LIbrary Media Connection\"",
        "About the Author",
        "A former high school teacher with a background in biochemistry and more than 10 years of experience in cytogenetic laboratories, Kristi Lew specializes in taking complex scientific information and making it fun and interesting for scientists and non-scientists alike. She is the author of more than 20 science books for children and teachers. Laura Hoopes is a biology professor at Pomona College in Claremont CA with more than 40 years of experience enlivening science to interest students in studying it.  She is passionate about supporting the interest of girls in science and has written a memoir and a biography of women who've married and had children to show that it's possible to have both a family and a rewarding career in science.  This book is Kristi Lew's brain child and she invited me to work with her to make these suggestions as exciting as possible."

She is Halstead-Bent Professor of biology emerita at Pomona College. Her research on molecular gerontology has been supported by over two million dollars in grant funds. Laura is married and has two grown children and one wonderful grandchild. In 2019, she released Opening Doors: Joan Steitz and Jennifer Doudna, Two Women of the RNA World. Laura believes in balancing career and family, as shown in her memoir, Breaking Through the Spiral Ceiling:An American Woman Becomes a DNA Scientist. For five years, she moderated the Women in Science Forum for the scientific journal Nature. After years of writing about science in passive voice and avoiding first person pronouns, she enjoys the freedom of creative writing. Laura received a Certificate in creative writing from UCLA in 2009 and an MFA in ENGLISH/Fiction at San Diego State University in 2013. The amount of joy and hard work that go into writing astonish her. She has published over twenty shorter works such as short stories, poetry, and personal essays. In 2013, Laura received the Jack London Award from the California Writers Club. She has been a mentor with WriteGirl, the outreach group to at-risk high school girls. She enjoys speaking to groups about her books, issues for women in science, why there are so few women science professors at Harvard, career-family balance, writing nonfiction and fiction, and creating a new career when over 65. Laura is currently working on a novel about a woman becoming an ecologist and a novel about a girl who needs to learn to be bad so she can write interesting stories for publication.']}"
