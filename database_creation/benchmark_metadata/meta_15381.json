        "A longtime favorite and contender for OR employee uniform of the year, the Blackridge is soft and plush, but built with athletes in mind: drirelease merino wool keeps you warm when wet, cool when overheated, and dry when working up a sweat. Plus, the naturally odor-blocking capabilities of wool and polyester make this piece a no-brainer for folks looking to impress their adventure partners, without smelling like it."
