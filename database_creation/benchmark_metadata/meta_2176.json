        "Fans of Claire Kingsley, Melanie Harlow, Lauren Landish, and Amy Daws will love this new series by Aria Bliss. Get ready to stay up all night laughing, crying, and swooning because this series has it all. A fake dating, sister’s best friend, opposites attract, forced proximity romance with a sexy, grumpy bar manager who’s given up on love and a career-driven woman who only has eyes for her laptop. This one has all the feels and enough steam to fog up your windows.",
        "The books in A Drunk Love Romantic Comedy series are all standalone novels and can be read in any order. But if you love family drama and the subtle build of future romances, I suggest you read them in order, starting with Not For Me."
