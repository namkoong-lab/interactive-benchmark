        "PreS-Gr 2—The premise of this delightful picture book is that underneath their crowns, princesses have a variety of hairstyle choices. From Afros to curls to dreadlocks, youngsters are shown reveling in all the different ways to wear their tresses. Puffs, twist outs, and frohawks are just a few of styles that are celebrated. Lovely rhyming text and vibrant illustrations depict how kids can achieve that perfect look. For example, little princesses with braids are shown joyously marching in parades, while others with head wraps dreamily take long naps. The message of choosing whatever style brings happiness promotes poise and self-confidence. This book, with its theme of the beauty of diversity, will resonate with princesses everywhere VERDICT A strong choice for picture book collections.—Mary Jennings, Camano Island Library, WA",
