        "The Power of TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic) offers a powerful alternative to the Karpman Drama Triangle, with its roles of Victim, Persecutor, and Rescuer, and provides the pathway for making the shift happen. This simple, friendly and engaging story conveys a meeting of three characters in a life-transforming conversation on a beach: the central character, David, a fellow named TED* (the embodiment of “The Empowerment Dynamic” who acts as Challenger to the Victim Orientation) and Sophia, who surfaces to serve as David’s Coach. The book is illustrated to present essential models to the reader in a simple and accessible way."
