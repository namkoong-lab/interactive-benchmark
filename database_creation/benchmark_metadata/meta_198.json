        "The OreMake Sheepdog knife series strives to meet the needs of culinary enthusiasts. This series combines a look inspired by Sheepdog pocket knives with the latest Japanese Damascus steel (T-CO69). It boasts a forged 69-layer construction that creates an eye-pleasing Damascus pattern and protects and strengthens the core. With a higher carbon content than AUS-10 or VG-10, the T-CO steel core provides superior out-of-the-box sharpness and edge retention. The 2 flanking layers of nickel alloy improve the core’s corrosion resistance. Each knife is perfectly balanced with an ergonomic, brass-accented G10 handle for comfortable control and a high-end look. The Nakiri knife is a Japanese-style vegetable knife designed for chopping, slicing, and dicing vegetables and herbs. It is also excellent for cutting fruits. The Kiritsuke knife is a multipurpose Japanese-style knife with the main purpose of slicing fish. It can also be used to slice meat or cut vegetables, herbs, and fruits."
