        "The pedal switches are mounted on the pedal inside the car, through a connection that can be threaded or through coupling. By operating the brake pedal (or clutch pedal), the electrical circuit in which they are inserted is opened/closed. Some switches, referred to as hydraulic pedal switches, are driven by liquids as they’re mounted in the hydraulic circuits."
