        "Product Description",
        "The Boa is a widely recognized reptile as one of the strongest and smartest snakes. You will be able to find these slithering creatures in Central and South America. They love warmer clients and prefer to hunt at night with skills they’ve had instinctually since birth. Sneaking up on prey and swallowing them whole leaves the stomach acid of the Boa to truly digest the food. Depending on the size of the food, it can go weeks after without eating. They’re reptiles that never stop growing from birth to the 20 to 30 years spent slithering around Earth. Wrap up in cuddles with this lifelike stuffed toy version of the amazing Boa that has fun and welcoming colors. It makes for the perfect birthday gift for kids or a unique gift for adults. Wild Republic has been developing plush animals and educational toys for kids of all ages since 1979, with a specialization in realistic stuffed animals.",
