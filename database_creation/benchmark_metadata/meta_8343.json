        "Dear Reader, These stories of classic romance are among my favorites—and I welcomed the chance to revise them for today’s reader.",
        "Six White Horses",
        "Oklahoma ranch owner Morgan Kincaid may be tall, masterful and everything else women look for in a man…but that doesn’t mean Patty King wants him. Riding in rodeos doesn’t leave her any time for romance, and besides, Patty’s not the marrying kind. Just why Morgan is so damn sure he can change her mind, she doesn’t know. Until their first kiss…",
        "Reilly’s Woman",
        "Pilot Reilly Smith isn’t the kind to talk a lot, but his smoldering gaze says it all: Leah Talbot is the most beautiful woman he’s ever taken up in the air. Then, when a storm strikes without warning and their chartered plane goes down in the mountains of Nevada, Reilly becomes a man with a mission: to bring Leah safely home…and into his life forever. You’ll find true romance and real-life heroes in these books! With love, Janet Dailey"
