        ") hits the ground running as she kicks off another winning romantic suspense series. A nervous Sarah Tucker is speeding north out of Los Angeles in a driving rain, constantly checking her rearview mirror, when she loses control of her car and careens into a ravine. In the hospital next morning, she doesn't remember a thing, not her name or anything about the infant's shoe found in the wrecked car. No purse, ID or clues of any kind show up until an irate man appears and demands Sarah return his daughter, 16-month-old Caitlyn, to him immediately. The seriously p-o'd Jake Sanders identifies Sarah as the child's mother and believes Sarah is faking amnesia in order to keep Caitlyn from him. Needless to say Jake sticks to Sarah like glue as they search for hints to Caitlyn's whereabouts and uncover Sarah's mysterious past. Freethy's at her prime with a superb combo of engaging characters and gripping plot.",
