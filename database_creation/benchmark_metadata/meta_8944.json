        "About the Author",
        "Marguerite Elsbeth (New Mexico) has facilitated shamanic healing and ritual groups, is a hereditary Strega, and is also exploring her ancestral ties to the Delaware Indian culture.  She has personally experienced crystal healing at the hands of a Shoshone medicine man and uses crystals in her own healing work. Kenneth Johnson holds a degree in Religious Studies from California State University Fullerton. His emphasis was in the study of mythology and this interest is reflected in his writing and his astrological practice. Kenneth discovered astrology while traveling in Europe during the summer of 1973. He studied in Amsterdam and London before returning to the United States and developing a practice which focuses on archetypal themes and personal mythologies. In addition to his astrological interests, Kenneth is also a musical theater librettist and a member of the Dramatists Guild. ~"
