        "From the Inside Flap",
        "As law enforcement officer with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, Lt. Tom Shirley was the law in one of the last true frontiers in the nation--the Florida Everglades.During his thirty-year career (1955-85), Shirley saw the Glades go from frontier wilderness to \"ruination\" at the hands of the Army Corps of Engineers. He watched as levees cut off the water flow and as controlled floods submerged islands that had supported humans and animals for 3,000 years, killing much of the wildlife he had sworn to protect.In \"Everglades Patrol,\" Shirley shares the stories from his beat--an ecosystem larger than the state of Rhode Island. He tells of stakeouts, catching wildlife for research, saving animals from manmade floods, of nights sleeping on the ground beside a distant campfire, and of the interrelationships of poachers and the law. In his vivid narrative, Shirley again hunts down dangerous rogue gladesmen, tangles with gators, and pursues poachers and moonshiners by airboat.Over the years, Shirley and his officers have been beaten, stabbed, kicked, cut, burned, bitten, drowned, and even killed while trying to protect the wetlands and its wildlife. But they continue to fight for the Everglades in order to save it.Shirley provides an entertaining, firsthand account of the Everglades wetlands and its wildlife from the 1940s to today. He pulls no punches in expressing his disdain for the disastrous effects that Flood Control and Water Management have had on the animals and the historic islands of the Everglades wetlands but leaves readers with hope that there is still time to reverse this damage. His ultimate goal is to see the Everglades restored to what it once was--a natural wonder of this world--and to keep it safe and available for generations to come. Tom Shirley is an active advocate for the restoration of the Everglades' original ecosystem and for acknowledgment of the Gladesmen's \"traditional use\" rights. In 1999, he received the Francis S. Taylor Outdoorsman of the Year Award for his efforts to conserve and protect the Everglades.",
