        "The Lore of the Camino de Santiago: A Literary Pilgrimage offers a different view of the ancient pilgrimage route from France to the shrine of Saint James in Santiago, Spain. Instead of leading you to accommodations, eateries and other pilgrim necessities, this book guides you to the literary creations found on or near the Camino along with some personal observations by the author.Most pilgrims walk the Camino never knowing or being aware of these stories. Some of the stories are folkloric and handed down orally. Some of the written works have endured the centuries and are considered literary masterpieces. While some sources are very old there are also some modern creations. Whatever their source, their inclusion with the Camino journey enriches it and perhaps gives the pilgrim or reader a better understanding of the Camino. At the same time the book delights and entertains as well as informs. Follow the path from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela with tales of knights, a nun, some rogues, and “the lost generation” to name a few. Experience the heartbreak of parents who lose their only son to the hangman’s noose or the father who carries his two small children to Santiago after his wife dies and an evil innkeeper confiscates his property including his mule used for travelling. Even the most obstinate reader or pilgrim would want to know the story behind one of the bridges crossed on this odyssey known as “Rabies’ Bridge”, or why chickens that live in an elevated coop in one of the grandiose cathedrals along the Camino are so revered.If you are a pilgrim about to do the Camino, the travel advisory “Know before you go” could well include the reading of this book. You will no doubt be on the lookout for these places, finding yourself anticipating the places before you see them, or making sure you do find them. Following the descriptions in the book will aid you in your task. Once you find them, the pleasure will be immeasurable. Whether you are a pilgrim or an armchair reader, you will uncover the hidden literary treasures found on the Camino de Santiago in this book. Through this reading you will gain a better and broader insight to the Camino."
