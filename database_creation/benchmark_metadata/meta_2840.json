        "The Greatest Myth Ever Dispelled ...Italy. A tough master of novices, Father Dante encounters the bold young priest Antonio who challenges his identity and accuses him of being THE Saint Nicholas. But despite the Father faking his death, a determined Antonio discovers a rather alive Dante arrayed in kilt and armor.In return for Antonio’s silence—and to protect the town from attracting all manner of darkness—Dante agrees to tell his life story. Without explanation, Dante orders Antonio to meet him at night in the abandoned Cathedral, the site of a former battle that the Church has kept secret for a generation.Until today.The Criskindl. Ice Steeds. The Unborn. Saint.From the Dark Ages’ when Poet-Sorcerers ruled kings, to the Holy Land when a new civilization was rising, to Revolutionary France where love is lost and gained, Father Dante pursues the one responsible for both his master and his mother’s deaths:Black Peter, his brother."
