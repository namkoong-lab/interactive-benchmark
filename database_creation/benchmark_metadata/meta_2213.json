        "Being born dead was a lousy way to start life, but not so for author Duane Dahl. He was born and raised in the far northeastern corner of South Dakota in the mid-1940s. This is a story which millions of Americans share, having roots in the farmlands of the Midwest prairie. It was a time of transition after World War II, when agricultural mechanization was replacing horse drawn equipment. Life on the prairie however, had not seen electrification of the ranches and farms in the heartland. Teachers in one room school houses taught children up through the eighth grade. Duane grew up with cattle and all through his life all he wanted to be was a cowboy and cattleman with his own ranch. Life however, is not that simple and “The Adventures of a Rancher” chronicles the disappointments and joys of living off the land. In an era when the national population is landless, having no direct connection with land, this is an important treatise that will help the urbanite understand the travails of growing America’s food. Ranchers often have other jobs to supplement their sporadic incomes. Whether it is grain, fruit, or meat, the rancher cannot negotiate the price they get for their investment and hard work. Duane found it necessary to become a long distance truck driver to help pay the bills and keep him in the cattle business. He drove the highways from Texas to Canada and not without near death experiences on the road. God rode with him and angels protected this gentle man.Ranchers of Duane’s generation looked beyond the sky not just for rain to water their crops and livestock, but lived in a relationship with God Almighty. Their faith in a living and loving God not only sustained them, but during the most difficult circumstances gave them a peace that surpassed understanding. Duane knew that rains, snow, wind, and drought came upon the land regardless one’s religion. Duane’s life has been an example of an imperfect man, loved by God, and being a blessing to those who have had the privilege of sharing the trail with him. This is a story of God-given resilience to the human spirit in a setting of ranching from the prairie of South Dakota to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and the Uinta Mountains of Utah. It has been those experiences that Duane has written that the faith of a child in a God that is ever present, is worthy of our trust, not only to save us, but by His grace strengthens us in all of our circumstances."

        "About the Author",
        "Duane Dahl was born in 1944 in Webster, South Dakota. He grew up just north of Ortley, a few miles east of Webster. He was a descendent of Norwegian immigrants who were farmers. Duane attended a one room school house through the eighth grade and graduated from Waubay High School. He always wanted to be a cattle rancher and pursued that goal with hard work and a willingness to do what it took to accomplish his dream. Undaunted by set back and disappointment he overcame adversity by the grace of God.",
