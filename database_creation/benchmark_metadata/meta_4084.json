        "Simplify your plumbing projects with the SharkBite brass crimp couplings. Composed of strong and sturdy lead free DZR brass, these tubing couplings are a great way to easily install piping without the need for additional tools, glue, or soldering. These couplings can be installed in wet lines and are approved for underground and behind-the-wall applications with no access panels (Wrapping required when burying underground). Rated to 200 psi and 200 degrees F (93 degrees C).",
        "From the Manufacturer",
        "SharkBite is the push-fit connection system that's really taking hold. It's the easiest way to join copper, CPVC or PEX pipe in any combination - with no soldering, clamps, unions or glue. Just insert the pipe and the stainless steel teeth bite down and grip tight, while a specially formulated O-ring compresses to create a perfect seal. Disassembly is just as fast using the simple disconnect tool. So fittings and valves can be easily changed and reused. They can even be rotated after assembly for easier installation in tight spaces. Get SharkBite, and get a grip on your next plumbing project. These fittings are lead free and meet all requirements for plumbing in California and Vermont."
