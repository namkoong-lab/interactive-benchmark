        "Bottomless Belly Button",
        ", comes a darkly fantastical graphic novel about a small town, a lowlife botanist, and a mysterious plant with strange powers.",
        "It’s 2060, and a devastating civil war has left the country in shambles. Professor Paulie Panther–botanist, writer, and hopeless romantic–arrives in the experimental forest town of Boney Borough to research a strange plant growing behind the high school. As he conducts his research, he befriends some of the local residents: Miss Jem, the alluring science teacher; Billy Borg, Boney Borough’s star athlete; and Pearl Peach, the rebellious schoolgirl. Paulie soon discovers that the plant, when smoked, imparts telepathic powers. But when he shares this remarkable drug with his new friends, he finds that they’re not interested in mind-expansion. In fact, it appears that Paulie’s brash individualism might not be at all welcome in a town that prefers conformity to eccentricity. Nominated for a 2009 Eisner Award and with a bold, innovative design,",
        "BodyWorld",
        "is a mind-blowing blend of science-fiction, classic high school drama, and futuristic what-if. It is at once funny and fearless–and sure to be the graphic novel event of the year."

        "A:",
        "When I was in college I was really into figure drawing, and kept being involved in it after I graduated. When you’re drawing someone, part of it is imagining what it’s like to be inside of the person. You imagine yourself in their body, or look for a psychology in the kinds of poses they make or their face. I was also thinking about how to express how people think in comics, in ways outside of the normal thought balloons (which are just words). If you’re doing a book about telepathy, you’re really doing a book about how people think, and what it’s like to be inside of another person. So of course that leads to a strange, confusing, and funny, often goofy, story.",

        "A:",
        "The main character, Paulie Panther, was the most fun for me. I think that shows on the page, especially during his interactions with some of the other characters, like Billy Borg. I can’t say that anyone was based on a specific, real person. The characters in",

        "are very stylized, cartoony, and unrealistic. I think they come more from my sense of humor than anything else.",

        "Bodyworld",
        ", but they were printed in grays because I didn’t know what I was doing. Color really freed me up. It was very playful. I work more unself-consciously in color, probably because for many years I was only interested in line drawing and black-and-white comics. It started to feel like my drawings were just an amalgamation of other people’s drawings, how someone else drew a hand or tree, but I didn’t have that baggage with color. The colors then helped my drawing, too. It’s hard to separate the different steps in",
        "Bodyworld",
        ", since all of the stages were integrated. It wasn’t like I did all of the drawings and then colored it. A lot of the pages moved back and forth between the drawing and the coloring stages. Because I don’t work inside of a system where I have to submit pencils, or ink a drawing and then color it--since I do everything--it allows me not to separate the stages in my mind.",
        "Q:",

        "I always wanted to be a cartoonist, and have been doing comics all of my life. I’ve had a lot of friends who wanted to be cartoonists in high school and then stopped in college, and others who stopped after college. A lot of super-talented people stop. It’s a tragedy. I don’t know why I haven’t quit, but I think it’s because I enjoy it so much, while to others the cartooning process seems to be painful. It’s still fun for me. Comics aren’t something that you should want to procrastinate from doing, and they’re more fun to make than they are to read. It’s like a noncompetitive nonspectator sport. You have to keep at it; otherwise you get out of practice.",

So I think what’ll happen in comics is that it’ll become more like other books, in that a Web cartoonist doesn’t necessarily read print comics, in the same way that some romance author doesn’t necessarily read the latest science fiction works. That’s already happening. But that’s unusual in comics. It’s usually been a small community. But, at the same time, I think there will be people who are viewing everything as a whole.

Boney Borough is a pastoral planned community in a dystopic future, where everyone knows each other's names and young romance blossoms at the high school die-ball games. But like all idyllic suburban communities, Boney Borough has a drug problem, and a newcomer, tweaked-out drug researcher Paulie Panther, takes advantage of it. Panther discovers a new kind of plant in the woods outside town, that, when smoked, allows people to telepathically experience one another's bodies and minds. Introduced to the local youth, the drug wreaks havoc with Boney Borough in some very unusual ways. First published as a serial comic on the author's Web site, the print version has added scenes, with gorgeous full-color pages to be read from top to bottom, as if you were scrolling through the story from beginning to end. This is key for the climactic scene, which unfurls in one extended panel. Shaw's willingness to experiment with his drawing style pays off particularly in pages portraying the effects of the drug with abstract blurring and melding of images. Another brilliant work that is sure to attract loads of attention and praise this year.",

        "Booklist",
        "*Starred Review* Shaw changes genre and tone from the not unplayful but serious realism of The Mother’s Mouth (2006) and Bottomless Belly Button (2008), folding sf and high-school romance into a grunge-noir continuum sprung from the ancient trope of the stranger coming to town. The burg in question is rigorously plotted (in a perfect square) Boney Borough, and the newcomer is Professor sic Paulie Panther, an experiential drug researcher (i.e., for all practical purposes, a professional addict). He comes to inspect a mysterious two-lobed plant growing on the local high-school campus and, as things unfold, to get involved (well, almost) with curvaceous teacher Jem Jewel and later with new grad Pearl Peach, whose athletic swain, Billy-Bob Borg, is already dismayed at her dumping him. If all those alliterative names don’t immediately give it away, the first few pages clarify that this is a black comedy on the lines of 1980s cult film Repo Man, which it most directly resembles in its space-alien conspiracy (the plant’s a Trojan horse) that never physically breaches the plot’s surface (the aliens never appear). Deploying color seemingly pasted-in à la hip 1950s advertising and UPA cartoons (especially impressive in scenes distorted by the plant’s mind-and-body-melding effects) to his trademark art-brut-meets-computer-animation drawing style (his protagonist’s name is probably a tip of the hat to stylistic forebear Gary Panter), Shaw shows himself as adept at dire comedy as he is with midlife and family crises. --Ray Olson",

        "\"A heady immersion into science fiction. . . . [Professor Paulie] Panther is, quite simply, one of the great messed-up antiheros of recent fiction. . . . Shaw pulls out all the stops to show such complex altered states in a manner both intuitive and chaotic. Graphics and text overlap, the timeframes and layers of meaning there to be teased out; in this haze, bits of one body get transferred to another, and it's tantalizingly unclear whose thoughts are being articulated. Most graphic novels are easily consumed at a gallop, but these sequences slow down the speed of",

        "“A psychedelic, romantic, science-fictional high school melodrama. . . . Shaw enthusiastically tosses one dizzying visual technique after another at his readers, because his story constantly heads into territories where simple narrative artwork isn’t enough. . . . Shaw is as eager to entertain as he is to mess with the parameters of his medium, and he goes out of his way to guide readers through the obstacle course he’s laid out. . . . [Shaw’s] a hell of an artist, constructing vivid, uncanny compositions with a spectacular sense of color and space. . . . And he seems to have fully absorbed the visual vocabularies of whole schools of cartooning that barely took notice of one another: old Japanese adventure comics, the art brut Fort Thunder scene, animation storyboards. . . . There’s so much gusto and invention [here] that it’s more rewarding than any number of more modest successes.” —Douglas Wolk,",

        "\"A sensory knockout. . . . The drawings a mix of stark black and white outlines with color accents, vivid yet dark. . . . Amazingly complex and impressively engrossing. . . .

        "Boston Globe",
        "\"A rare example of the hype not doing it justice. . . . The story takes place in some murky corner of Shaw’s brain where time, perception, emotion, and even human metabolism are all raw materials for the sculpting, where memories manifest like graphic phantoms, and the subconscious bubbles up in textual blurts. The book’s design is just as sublime, and just as intrinsic to the overall vibe; Shaw’s lush-yet-angular artwork—which is deceptively deeper than it first seems—takes random detours into world-building splashes, foldout pages, and dead white space.
