        "Toddler-PreS—Stoop brings her unique wood grain canvases to the nursery rhyme scene in this introduction to 13 well-known action songs, such as \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" \"If You're Happy and You Know It,\" and \"Row, Row, Row, Your Boat.\" The plywood background lends a distinctive texture to the dreamy illustrations as they create flowing water and cloudy skies. The diverse cast have happy faces; even the school bus and the tea kettle smile as their songs are introduced. Each easy-to-read, well-placed rhyme has its own spread, with plenty of visual clues. There are no musical notes to indicate tunes, however, so those looking for singing guidelines may be disappointed, and only the first verse of longer rhymes (\"Wheels on the Bus\") is included. The collection ends on a charming note, with \"What Does Your Kitty Say?\" introducing familiar animal sounds until Mommy says, \"I love you\" and offers a big hug. VERDICT The soft edges, muted colors, and accessible rhymes make this a soothing choice when cozying up with babies at bedtime; it's well worth finding space on shelves for this nursery rhyme collection.—Kristine M.

        "\"Stoop's plywood canvas, with wood grain peeking through, echoes the aged, deep tradition of the songs, while the hazy shades of blues, greens, and oranges are like a snug hug. Plenty of opportunity for adult-baby interaction and early-literacy singing skills.\" ―",
