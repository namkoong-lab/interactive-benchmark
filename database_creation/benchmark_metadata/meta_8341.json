        "Containing more than 300 equations and nearly 500 drawings, photographs, and micrographs,this reference surveys key areas such as optical measurements and in-line calibration methods. It describes cleanroom-based measurement technology used during the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits and covers model-based, critical dimension, overlay, acoustic film thickness, dopant dose, junction depth, and electrical measurements; particle and defect detection; and flatness following chemical mechanical polishing. Providing examples of well-developed metrology capability, the book focuses on metrology for lithography, transistor, capacitor, and on-chip interconnect process technologies."
