The Cards are targeted at those studying art history, especially at the intro college or AP high school level, but they're a lovely way to brush up on your knowledge and find some creative inspiration. --Hyperallergic Art BlogTHANK YOU so much for the Masterpiece Cards! They are beyond amazing! My husband & I study them over breakfast :) The cards have been a wonderful way to captivate the imaginations of the children in our family! --M. Betzer, SC\"We LOVE these Cards! We are a home schooling family and enjoy using the Cards for discussion starters..
