        "The renowned beauty and storied history of the Hudson Valley countryside have drawn people to Columbia County, New York for years. Since 1946, locals and visitors alike have taken delight in \"The Man in the Black Hat,\" an unsigned column in the weekly Chatham Courier of reflections on people and events both local and wordly.",
        "Although the column has remained officially anonymous for the nearly 60 years of its existence, the author's identity has been a thinly-veiled secret in Chatham and surrounding towns. In this first-ever collection of his work, columnist Albert S. Callan takes off the black hat and takes a bow. Readers will want to stand and applaud the humor, wisdom and humanity of this country scribe."
