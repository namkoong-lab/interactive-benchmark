        "When my wife was diagnosed with cancer, our family's world was turned inside out. Flying from our home in Senegal in search of healing, the world seemed strangely disorienting. That is when I turned to poetry to try and make sense of out of our new life. Yellow:chemopoetry from a caretaker's journey is an invitation to enter into my creative moments of meaning making as I watch for healing, joy, love, and hope. In conversation with philosophers, poets, mystics, doctors, birds, holy scriptures and ecology, I contemplate this new perspective. Sometimes in sonnets, terza rima, haiku, form or free verse, this book length collection of poetry reveals my pursuit to understand truth, goodness and beauty in the face of fear, pain and the disorienting world of radiation, surgery and chemotherapy. It is, in a phrase, chemopoetry. For anyone who has wrestled with cancer, or striven to care for loved ones living in the wake of it, this collection of poetry offers solidarity, and inspiration to contemplate the hope and holiness of everyday life."
