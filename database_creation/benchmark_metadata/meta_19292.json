        "The zinc plated steel sheet metal screw with pan head and Phillips drive has a Type A point for forming threads in thin metals between 0.015\" and 0.050\" thick and resin impregnated plywood. The Type A point has a conical tip and spaced threads. Steel is often used in applications where strength is the primary consideration. The zinc plating offers corrosion resistance and has a reflective appearance. The pan head has a flat top and short vertical sides with a rounded top edge. The Phillips drive has an x-shaped slot that accepts a Phillips driver and is designed to allow the driver to slip out of the head to help prevent over-tightening and damage to the thread or fastener.",
        "Sheet metal screws, a type of self-tapping screw, have threads down the entire length of the shank for tapping and fastening thin material. The point style determines the type of material the screw can be used on, such as metal, wood, or plastic. These screws commonly have a sharp point that helps penetrate the material."
