It stands firmly on four curled iron feet that gracefully arc up and around the planter bucket, accented with wire \"stems\" and artfully crafted leaves. The lantern at its top is traditional in style, but modern in technology. Powered by a discreet solar panel it adds a charming glow after dark. A truly elegant addition to a front porch or walkway.
