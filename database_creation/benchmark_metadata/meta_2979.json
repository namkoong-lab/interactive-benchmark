My name is Lena Skye and I have been writing romance for a long while now but only recently got published for the first time. I like to specialise in African American and Multicultural Romance as I feel it is so lacking in the world and I could never find such books available to read when I was a young girl. I would search the library up and down for a book featuring black characters and would find nothing. So I am determined to help change that.', 'When I am not drinking a skinny Latte and tapping away on my keyboard, I love to go shopping and add to my collection of heels.
