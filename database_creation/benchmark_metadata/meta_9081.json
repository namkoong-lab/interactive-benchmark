After several attemtps to sum up my life in less than 4000 characters, I've given up on anything witty or terribly revealing. Suffice to say, I was born in Texas, have spent virtually all of my life in Pennsylvania, and I've been blessed by having a loving family, good friends, and a wonderful husband, Robert. We have 3 cats (Calvin, Daisy, and Willow), and I'm pretty bossy, which is why teaching and writing books that tell people how to do things are very appealing pursuits.\"]}"
