        "Expert crafter Clare Youngs has long been influenced by the folk art of cultures from around the world.Here she uses some of her favourite motifs to create 35 gorgeous projects to make. Clare uses traditional imagery as well as a more modern take on classic folk art—with beautiful results. The designs use a range of different embroidery stitches—including seed stitch, French knots, satin stitch, and cross stitch—to create striking arrangements. These embroidery patterns are then used to adorn a multitude of items made in a variety of fabrics including a picnic bag, purse, a gingham dress for a little girl, soft toys, pillows, a table cloth, seat cover, buttons, and more. So whether you love the traditional style of Scandinavian needlecraft, with its hearts, flowers, and birds, or the intricate patterns and symbols of South American folk art, you are guaranteed to find something beautiful to make for yourself or to give as a gift. Each project comes with clear step-by-step instructions and beautiful illustrations, as well as a useful techniques section at the back, so first-time crafters will have no trouble making any of the projects, while more experienced stitchers will find plenty of inspiration and ideas."
