Perfect for adding stripes to white boards, architect work, or other artwork, and creating designs in your painting projects! Scrapbookers, artists, architects will love this. Use in school classroom, office, kitchen, or college work.",
        "THIS IS NOT AUTOMOTIVE VINYL TAPE: This is textured paper painters tape for spraying LATEX or paints which do not react with paper.",
        "MAY BLEED if you use soggy rollers, spraying thick coats, or having too wet of brush. MAY NOT PLAY WELL with certain types of oils or lacquers so do a small test before committing to project!",
        "Please NOTE: Surfaces must be absolutely 100% clean, dry, dust, dirt, debris, sand, grit, moisture, humidity, and oil free before application!",
        "While the surface of this tape can somewhat resist moisture, adhesive definitely cannot. ALL tape adhesive is pressure and heat sensitive. Must press firmly into place with your fingers and apply at room temperature to secure the adhesive. The dryer, warmer, and more clean your installation is, the better your experience.",
        "REMOVE ASAP after painting!",
        "The adhesive in painters tape is known as semi-permanent removable and paint CURES, it does not dry. If you leave this on too long after painting you will have great difficulty removing it, tearing into shreds and leaving residue behind. COMMON SENSE is required, you cannot expect tape to perform miracles! 21 day release time is BEFORE PAINTING - so once you have painted you should pull when the paint is stable. Pull carefully, slowly, and at 45 degree angle away from painted edge.",
        "TapeSmith specializes in hard to find tapes up to 12\" in width, search for more sizes!"
