        "2016 release, the fourth album country singer/songwriter Randy Houser. The album is the follow-up to his 2013 album How Country Feels. Includes the single 'We Went'. \"I'm very excited to finally get some new music out there,\" Houser says. \"Three years is a bit longer than I expected in between How Country Feels and this record, and so much has happened in that time. I wrote a handful of songs on Fired Up, but there are songs like 'A Little Bit Older' that I knew I had to record the moment I heard them.\""
