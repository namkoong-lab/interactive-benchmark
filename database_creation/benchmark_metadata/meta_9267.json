        "This book is for anyone who upgrades from their point-and-shoot or first DSLR to a Canon Rebel T1i/500D and wants to get the best shots possible but isn't sure what to do next. There's the manual, of course, as well as competing books, and while they all tell camera owners, often in 400+ pages, what the camera can do, none of them shows them exactly how to use their camera to create great images! This book has one goal: to teach Canon Rebel T1i/500D owners how to make great shots using their Canon camera. It teaches them how to use their T1i/500D to create the type of photographs that inspired them to buy the camera in the first place. Everything in the book is in service of creating a great image. Starting with the top things they need to know about their camera, the author then carefully guides readers through the modes of the camera. Users will get practical advice from a pro on which settings to use when, great shooting tips, and even end-of-chapter assignments that will allow T1i/500D owners to immediately put to use all the great info in each chapter."
