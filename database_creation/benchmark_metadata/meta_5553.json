        "ULTRAGEL motorcycle seat gel pads offer the widest selection of motorcycle seat gel available today. ULTRAGEL gel pads have been formulated to give the \"Sweet Spot\" best balance of tactile and dynamic properties to maximize rider comfort. Soft enough to easily conform to body contours and to minimize bounce or resilience, yet firm enough to provide maximum comfort needed to support and stability to the rider. We've also optimized gel thickness so you don't pay for more gel than needed, but which really enhances rider comfort, compared to thin 1/4\" or 3/8\" pads. GEL THICKNESS MATTERS! DON'T LET ANYONE CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE! All gel pads can easily be trimmed or shaped using a sharp-edged cutting tool such as scissors or Xacto knives, box cutters. They can also be easily contoured, cut or shaped with hot-wire or hot-knife cutters. IMPORTANT NOTE: These are INSERTS ONLY, and are not to be used as is for top cushions (unless you provide your own cover) for your motorcycle seating area. These pads are designed to be INSTALLED underneath the surface of your seat."
