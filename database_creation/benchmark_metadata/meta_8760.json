        "About the Author",
        "Bentley Boyd's comix come from both sides of his brain: He graduated from Harvard University cum laude with a degree in History and Literature and has been a professional cartoonist for 15 years. He is a passionate advocate for the use of the graphic novel format to teach nonfiction to today's visual learners. Boyd lives in Williamsburg, Virginia, and draws from all the historical resources within a day's drive of that magnificent Colonial capital."

His daily editorial cartoons for the Harvard Crimson were syndicated throughout New England and earned him the first Al Capp Satire Award given at Harvard. In 1991 he won an Ohio Associate Press first place award for his editorial cartooning. He created Chester the Crab for the Daily Press of Newport News, Virginia, in 1995 and was given the 2003 Virginia Council for the Social Studies Friend of Education Award. He has been commissioned by very smart people to make dynamic comic book histories for George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the Library of Virginia, and the cities of Norfolk, VA; Lexington, MA; and Oberlin, OH.
