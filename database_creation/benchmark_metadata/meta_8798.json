        "In this fresh look at a beloved book, Tim Gallant develops a reading of Galatians that follows the unified thread of Paul's chain of argument. Showing sensitivity both to the coherence of Scripture and to the freshness of the apocalyptic new creation brought about by Jesus the Messiah, Paul's Travail weaves rigorous exegetical work, a strong sense of biblical theology and typology, and experienced pastoral sense into one harmonious whole."
