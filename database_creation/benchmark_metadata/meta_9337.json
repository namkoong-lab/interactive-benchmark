        "If you are a teenager, you probably know plenty about issues like arguing with your parents, rebelling against authority, and attitude problems―either firsthand or because everyone expects you to be like that! But what if you knew that these things actually spring from a problem with anger; that they‘re the result of being a sinner, not a teenager; and that you can have more control over them than people think you can? Biblical counselor Lou Priolo provides a practical, understandable, and biblical approach to mastering sinful anger and its causes and effects. He helps you to assess your level of anger and what form it takes, to identify some of the heart issues that lead to anger (and how to replace them with biblical attitudes), and to have open communication with your parents without the distractions that cause arguments. Practical tools, such as journaling exercises and discussion points to talk over with your parents, help you to take measurable steps toward “keeping your cool.”"

        "Being a teenager is hard. Finally help is in print! Lou Priolo shows what teenage anger is and where it comes from. Open these pages and you will find hope, encouragement and the Savior. -- Rick Holland, Senior Pastor, Mission Road Bible Church, Prairie Village, KSFINALLY! A practical handbook for teens on how to cope with and handle their anger! In the midst of an angry world and an angry culture, this timely book will do a world of good for any teenager or adult desiring to improve his or her relationship with God and with other people. -- Joel R. Beeke, President, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary“Lou Priolo offers a book for young people dealing with anger that is refreshingly and doggedly biblical. With a thoroughly gospel-centered approach, he helps young people confront sin head on, and move toward finding both grace and change by the power of God’s Word and God’s Spirit – while remaining intensely practical and concrete. I recommend this book to you as a solid and biblically faithful resource for young people – and their parents – who are dealing with anger issues.” -- Jon Nielson, College Pastor, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois",
