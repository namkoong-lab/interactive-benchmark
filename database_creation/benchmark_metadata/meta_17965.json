        "The SOG Bladelight kit comes with a Bladelight Hunt Knife (with Sheath) and a Bladelight Folding Mini Knife. Both knives have built in bright LED lights to seek out adventure. Bladelight Hunt Adding a healthy dose of light to your favorite hunting knife, the Bladelight embeds six exceptionally bright LED lights into the glass-reinforced nylon handle creating a fixed-blade knife designed to illuminate your ventures afield. SOG has paid extra attention to the exacting demands and needs of hunters in recent years, and this new member of the award-winning Bladelight family is destined to become a favorite among big game aficionados. The six intensely bright LED lights (three on each side of the blade) have a measured output of 30 lumens that'll shine a whole new light on field-dressing activities. Its dual purpose will be a welcome addition in the woods, finding a blood trail or the way in and out of the stand. The fixed skinning blade - made of 8CR13MOV stainless steel - is anchored to a glass reinforced nylon handle. One AAA battery (included) will provide more than four hours of burn time for the LED lights. A sheath is included. Bladelight Folding Mini Is it a flashlight? Is it a knife? Yes and yes. The BladeLight Folder Mini has super bright LEDs on both sides and an easy to open blade uniquely blending blade and beam. It's a smart touch of illumination for in-the-dark activities. Utilizing powerful and popular CR2032 lithium batteries (included), the BladeLight Folder Mini sends 45 total lumens from two LEDs on each side of the blade for shadow-less light. In addition to freeing a hand from another light source, this eliminates shadows that would otherwise occur if using a headlamp or flashlight when cutting in low-light situations making it safer for anyone to use. The BladeLight Mini Folder is rated at IPX-4 for water resistance suitable for use on a boat or near water. With the blade folded, it can be used as a go-to flashlight for impromptu nighttime excursions. The glass-reinforced nylon and aluminum handle gives it a durable feel while the simple, yet time-tested liner-lock locking mechanism keeps the blade open and enables one-handed closing. The BladeLight Mini Folder comes with a reversible low-carry pocket clip and a satin polished blade. It's ideal. It's ready when you are. Shipping Note: Shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, PO Boxes, and APO addresses is not available for this item."
