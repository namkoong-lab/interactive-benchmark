        "\"Wow, Paula! Thank you so much... I've been trying to perfect macarons for so long. I've jumped recipe to recipe, back and forth on both methods. I dreaded this long video but I am so dedicated to macarons that I sat and learned through the whole entire video and I don't regret one second. I learned so much that I never learned elsewhere. I appreciate your video and all the hard work and effort put into it! After 80+ trials (not exaggerating), I tried your recipe once and I got no hollows. I'm so grateful I came across this video and your recipe. I studied it so hard and hard work really pays off! I found out it was my oven that was messing me up. I tried your wooden spoon trick and that was magic! No more gummy interiors! :-) xx\"  \"Hey Paula, just wanted to give you an update. I watched your video and used your tips to make a perfect batch. I've searched YouTube up and down looking for a decent tutorial and never found yours unfortunately, but I must say it's the best by far!!!",

        "Macarons Math, Science, and Art",
        "pulls out all the stops in developing a stable and low-moisture macaron batter and macaron mixing technique by incorporating uncommon practices such as the use of tapioca starch, whipping the meringue for 16 minutes, a baking stone, nested baking pans, a cracked-open oven door, and a small fan.",
        "About the Author",
        "Paula Lujan Quinene writes mostly about her long-time loves--Guam, exercise, and desserts. Born and raised on the 32-mile-long rock, this proud islander now lives in North Carolina. Schooled as an exercise scientist at the University of Oregon, Paula has been able to help friends, family, and fans with their cooking and exercise endeavors. Paula used her science background to artfully meld the science of baking with the art of making French macarons.",

She graduated from the University of Oregon in 1997 with a bachelor\\'s of science in Exercise and Movement Science, hoping to return to the island as an anatomy teacher. A resident of North Carolina since 2000, Paula\\'s homesickness or \"mahalangness\" have resulted in her Guam cookbooks, A Taste of Guam, and Remember Guam, and her romance novels set in Guam, Conquered and Stormed. Paula is a pastry-chef-at-heart, thus Macarons Math, Science, and Art, was a pure pleasure to write. Paula\\'s home on the web is www.paulaq.com.']}"
