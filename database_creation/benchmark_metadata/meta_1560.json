    "description": [
        "This work of art was designed by Artist Paul A. Lanquist (PAL), a Pacific Northwest artist who currently lives in central Oregon. Through the years, PAL has gravitated to the work of illustrators from the 20's, 30's, and 40's that use color and design to communicate their ideas in a straightforward way. By combining the nostalgic look and feel of the past with the spectacular scenery of this country, PAL has created destination and travel posters that capture the beauty and life style of these unique areas. Art print posters are from an original work of art created by an award-winning artist. They are professionally printed at our facilities in the United States on the highest quality art paper using premium, long-lasting art inks that generate intense, rich colors that are true to the artist’s vision and original creation. The time and care put into producing your art poster will make it a tremendous addition of your kitchen, bedroom, family room, office, or even dorm room wall décor."
