        "Experienced bead designer Karin Van Voorhees distills years of beading wisdom into easy-to-understand keys: Learn the basics, keep it simple, and use materials you love. With the three keys in mind, beginners will be able to make over 45 pretty jewelry projects they’ll be proud to wear. With the first key, “Master the Basics,” beginners will learn fundamental jewelry-making skills and apply those new skills to projects of increasing complexity. With the second key, “Keep It Simple,” new beaders will pick up a few basic design skills and learn the ins and outs of using spacers and beadcaps, working with beads of differing shapes and sizes, creating a multi-strand look, and more. And with the last key, “Let the Materials Tell the Story,” jewelry makers will begin to experiment with materials and components and learn how a few simple swaps can completely change the look of the finished piece."

I\\'m always fiddling around with ideas and trying to make things just right for me. It may be turning a pair of too-short jeans into perfect summer capris, or making a beautiful necklace to wear to the special occasion that\\'s just hours away. I\\'m lucky to have combined my love of making things with my love of writing. My books are a way of sharing my ideas with you, so you can make them your own.
