        "The Giant is ill. His daughter in peril. Her bastion a psycho. The worlds torn asunder. War is fueled by want, Subversion by greed. What value is Free Will, If you can be reborn as a God? The Northern Star: The Beginning, which Examiner hailed as on of the \"Top 5 Indie-Published Books You Haven't Read, But Should,\" showed us a violent, technology dependent world where the Coalition--the combined might of China, the U.S., and the EU--occupied oil-rich countries to take all that remained. The Northern Star: Civil War takes us further down the rabbit hole, where the digital connectedness of our world has allowed one man to subvert nations in his quest for immortality. In the first novel, John Raimey, a crippled soldier, sacrificed himself for duty and family and became the first Tank Major, a bionic soldier powerful enough to level buildings. His sacrifice was in vain. Ten years later, mentally ill, estranged from his daughter, and stationed in Africa to protect the mines needed to keep cyberspace alive, he airdrops into a town where the adults are murdered and the children abducted. What Raimey uncovers sets him on a new mission: save his daughter, no matter the cost."

Because even seasoned science fiction readers well versed in stories of military conflict and cyber-futures will enjoy something different in The Northern Star: Civil War . . . . With its cornerstone foundations rooted in perceptions and patterns of modern times, it's military sci-fi and futuristic cyber-reality at its best.\"",

The plot and characters have substantial depth to satisfy an avid sci-fi reader like myself . . . . The technologies such as the military's bionic soldiers and the Mindlink are not just fascinating, but do have the credible possibilities to exist.\" -",
