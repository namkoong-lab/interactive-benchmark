        "Taking a political economy of media approach, this book examines Amazon as a significant actor in the global media landscape.",
        "Amazon is mainly conceived in the popular consciousness and media commentary as a corporate body, selling products and services to individual consumers and organisations, but Brevini and Swiatek show that Amazon has become a communication giant that trades in diversified media (its own and others), and exerts a significant influence on global communication, especially through its online services. Further, the authors provide evidence of Amazon's multiple influences on politics, economics, and culture.",
        "With its comprehensive and critical overview, this book is ideal for students, scholars, and researchers of media and communication studies and political economy."
