        "The little square that has big implications for your fly control accounts Filth flies are not just an unsightly nuisance; they can spread bacteria and other disease-causing organisms. Controlling them, however, can be quite challenging - especially in commercial kitchens and other food-handling areas where these pests can thrive. In these environments, it is critical to deliver targeted, effective and unobtrusive control measures. The revolutionary EndZone insecticide sticker from FMC has been designed to give pest professionals a totally unique filth fly service offering that's discreet, affordable and incredibly easy to use. The first and only fly sticker of its kind in the country, EndZone delivers fast-acting, long-lasting filth fly control to both residential and commercial accounts, indoors and out."
