        "I've never been able to give up on fate, no matter how cruel it's been in the past. So when it drops a stranger’s leather-bound journal at my feet, I know I should walk away...but I don’t.I pick her up, bend her spine, spread her pages. From the first word, I'm a goner. The owner didn't give me access to her most intimate desires, her private darkness, or her candid, sensual poetry—but it all goes down like warm milk. From that point forward, I’m the one consumed.",
        "HALSTON",
        "I went to his apartment and let him take my picture. Just once, to see how it would feel. I'm not his to look at, to inspire, to touch, but when he watches me through his lens, it’s a high I don't want to come down from...My journal is the one place I can be myself—as long as I can tie it up and put it away when I'm finished. But when Finn undoes the bow, he pulls strings that could unravel each of us."
