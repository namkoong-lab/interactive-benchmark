        "Review",
        "\"If you grew up in South Carolina, or if you wish you did, put this book on your must-read list. You will smell the salt marsh, you will feel the sand between your toes, you will recognize the clay on your shoes, and you will recall what it is like to be back, enjoying a family picnic on the sand in a National Wildlife refuge, or spending a sizzling hot summer day at a farmer's market.\" \"I love everything about this book. It's what I like to call a literary triple threat. Great writing. Great story. Great Characters. Bibiana Krall's Carolina Spirit: A Tale From the Lowcountry sings. As far as words go, Carolina Spirit has a rhythm that draws you in, wraps itself around you, and holds on tight.\"",
