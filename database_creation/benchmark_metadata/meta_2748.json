His grandfather introduced him to the alternate history writings of Harry Turtledove at a young age. That started a life-long love affair with speculative fiction. After being fired from a thankless job in retail sales, he began to write his own stories. His first publication was Body Rentals. Since then, he has written 11 books, including War of the Worlds: Retaliation, the superhero series, Sixteen Sunsets Saga, and hard sci-fi collaborative novel, Days Until Home. His books are favorites among fans of Sin City, The Martian, The Punisher, and Firefly. His work is a fast paced, no-nonsense, thrill ride into many genres, including science fiction, superhero, dystopian, and historical fiction. His works are available in nine languages, and he has fans on all seven continents.']}"
