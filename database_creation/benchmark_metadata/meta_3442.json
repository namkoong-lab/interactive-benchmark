    "description": [
        "Innovative in their formulation, Mission Gold are the first watercolors ever manufactured that are free of silicone dioxide. This thickening agent inhibits transparency as it encapsulates pigments and creates a granular effect on paper. Mission Gold Watercolors are free of this agent, naturally viscous and unsurpassed for their clarity and luminosity. Created from only the finest pigments available, these colors are matured in traditional Korean pots until they achieve maximum brilliance. The result is pure, intense color that is lightfast with minimal color shift. The absence of a thickening agent also means that the concentrated colors disperse beautifully, even on a dry palette and paints left to dry for months are easily lifted. When mixed with a little Titanium White, Mission Gold can replace gouache making it ideal for design work."
