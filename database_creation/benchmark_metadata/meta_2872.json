        "Fans of fantasy and Norse mythology rejoice! Immerse yourself in a fantastic re-imagining of Norse legend that brings the gods to life in a world that has pushed them into the shadows. A new age of the gods has arrived! A thousand years ago, the age of the Norse gods ended in flames and the talisman that gave the gods their power, the Eye of Odin, was destroyed. Their stories became myth, the Eye was forgotten, and the age of man’s power began. Thyra Ariksen, grew up listening to the stories of the Norse gods, but always thought they were exactly that--stories. But when the monsters and jealous gods from those stories begin to invade her life, claiming she has the Eye of Odin, she is forced to accept the god within her and race to protect both the world of magic and the world of men from the destructive conclusion to a war that began centuries ago. The Eye of Odin has again chosen its champion, and it’s up to Thyra to become the god this age needs."
