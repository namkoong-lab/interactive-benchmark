        "From the Author",
        "Who wasgovernor of Colorado in 1908? What was the Ludlow Massacre? When didold Tom Tobin die? Did they ever locate the steam locomotive thatplunged into Kiowa Creek in--was it 1877? Perhaps you might want tolearn about William F. Cody's life. Finding the date on which BuffaloBill died could lead you to a newspaper obituary. A Colorado Chronologywill supply answers to these and other questions as well as provide awealth of information concerning the history and heritage of theCentennial State.     This chronicle began in the late 1980s as anoutgrowth of my need, as a writing historian, for an accurate andconcentrated source of Colorado history facts and dates. While workingon some critical passage (usually around midnight when the library wasclosed) the lack of a simple fact often became a blockade to thewriting process. Too much time was being spent leafing through myresources trying to locate a trivial but necessary piece of data. \"Whatwas making headlines in June of 1892?\" It occurred to me that manypeople could benefit from an aggregation of such information and soonthis volume began to take shape. As your chronicler, I have endeavoredto seek the most reliable sources and have made reasonable effort todetermine correct information and exact dates. Some items provedthemselves to be too elusive to warrant the time needed to locate allthe details but, hopefully, these entries will provide you with a basisto begin your information quest.    While I do not purport to have included everyincident and date of Colorado history between these covers, thischronology contains a considerable collection of historical nuggetsthat provide basic information. Facts about Native Americans,railroads, sports, company incorporations, people, crime, industry,mining, weather, etc., can be located quickly and conveniently. A largenumber of Colorado's \"firsts\" have been noted.    An extensive index is provided as well as severallists designed to furnish quick access to factual information aboutColorado. A little creativity using the index can bring to lightfurther source materials. Remember,  too, that an item may bementioned more than once during a year so be sure to scan the entireyear. I chose to index items by the year they occurred rather than bypage number because this can be useful if you know an approximate date.The year 1979 was chosen as an endpoint because that is when Bell &Howell began producing their excellent microfilm indexes to most majornewspapers. These nuggets can be used as a crude index to earlyColorado newspapers--old newspaper stories are a treasure trove ofeye-witness information and background material.    My thanks to all the authors, historians,librarians, public relations people, researchers, trivia buffs, andunknown newspaper scribes who provided the bulk of the material forthis work. Without your combined efforts this chronology could notexist.    Whether you are trying to locate some bit of trivia,working on a term paper, book, news story, or just browsing throughColorado's fascinating past, I hope you find this work useful andinformative.",
