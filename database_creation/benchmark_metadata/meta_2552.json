        "\"I think so far out of Ethan Westfield's books, this one scared me the most. The usual elements that make his books stand out were definitely reflected here since there were a lot of bloody and dangerous situations here, not to mention the non-stop action. [...] I admired the writing style because there were times when the writing would try to lead you to think one conclusion but as you read, there is a totally opposite one instead.\" - N.K.P., Amazon review",
