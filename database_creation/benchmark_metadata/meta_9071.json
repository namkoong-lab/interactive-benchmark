        "Our CRT & RRT Exam Study Guide Is Unlike Any Other",
        "If you'd like to get the CRT & RRT test score you deserve, to quit worrying about whether your score on the CRT & RRT test is \"good enough,\" and to beat the test taking game so you can become a Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) or Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT), then this might be the most important message you read this year.",
        "Our comprehensive study guide for the Certification Examination for Entry Level Respiratory Therapists and Written Registry Examination for Advanced Respiratory Therapists is written by our CRT & RRT test experts, who painstakingly researched the topics and the concepts that you need to know to do your best on the NBRC Examination. Our original research into the Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) Exam and Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) Exam, offered by the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC), reveals the specific content areas and the essential skills that are critical for you to know on the CRT & RRT test. We've taken the information and developed a study guide that is guaranteed to help you be successful on the CRT & RRT test.",
        "Now, we know you may be skeptical, so let us give you three good reasons we can back up what we claim:",
        "The Three Reasons To Believe What We Say",
        "The First Reason:",
        "Our company's name is Mometrix Test Preparation, and we have a team of standardized test researchers who have worked on developing our study guide for the CRT & RRT test. The standards for who gets to work on the team are very strict- we demand the best for our customers, and only those who met our exacting standards made the cut. The dedicated research staff have years of combined experience in mastering the content and skills necessary to succeed on the toughest exams.",
        "The Second Reason:",
        "Some academic studies have revealed that test takers do not really benefit from the traditional test preparation process. But we knew there had to be a solution- if test takers were not doing well on the CRT & RRT test despite high intelligence, there had to be a set of secret keys to the test that would open the door of success for these test takers.",
        "We believe we have succeeded in finding the secret keys of the exam. What we found was surprising, and in some cases",
        "ridiculously simple",
        "once explained to the average test taker.",
        "We put the findings together in a thorough, concise study guide that we believe allows any test taker, at any skill level, to",
        "improve his or her results dramatically",
        "with a",
        "minimum of effort",
        ".",
        "The Third Reason:",
        "We created the product in part because we were frustrated by the options available to test takers who really wanted to do well on the CRT & RRT test.",
        "A common approach is to TEACH the material, instead of TEACHING THE TEST. That's not necessarily good enough for the CRT & RRT test- you have to know how to apply the knowledge. Most test takers already have a general knowledge of the material that will be covered on the exam.",
        "One reason some test takers do well on the day of the test is that they have made the critical connection between the material they learned and how to use the material to succeed on the CRT & RRT test.",
        "Our guide addresses the difference between merely knowing the material and knowing how to use the material to",
        "perform on test day",
        ".",
        "You're going to save time, money, and aggravation. You'll learn to avoid the mistakes and the bad strategies that you've been vulnerable to. --Just for starters, here are some ways our product can help your score on the CRT & RRT test...",
