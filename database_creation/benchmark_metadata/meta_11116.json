        "When we say \"HotSpot,\" we're not talking about the trendiest place in town. We're talking about that red, scaly, itchy patch your dog's been scratching. We know, it's not nearly as glamorous. Luckily, you can tame the itch once and for all with our HotSpot Anti-Itch Spray. We've created a simple, but effective, blend of botanical ingredients formulated to soothe itchy, dry skin so it can finally heal. When your dog scratches, it can irritate and even tear the skin, making matters worse. One spray of HotSpot calms the itch so your dog can get back to doing dog things and the hot spots can heal, returning to healthy and soft skin over time. Our formula is so gentle you can even use it on raw or broken skin. It won't cause the sting that comparable formulas can, even on red, inflamed, or severely irritated skin. Tea tree oil soothes and calms itchiness, while aloe vera and chamomile offer healing properties to moisturize and promote skin rejuvenation. It contains no alcohol, which many formulas do (this can make dryness worse). We use only purified water to suspend the ingredients for the gentlest formula you'll find. It's safe for dogs that are six months of age and older."
