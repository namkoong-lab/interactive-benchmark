        "This curiously empowering guide by a prosperity televangelist shows how modern thinking and Old Testament prescriptions can help people create the lives they want. The focus is on thinking boldly and grounding oneself in biblical passages rather than allowing cynical or destructive influences to creep into our sense of what's okay for us. The author's 10 steps are righteously grounded in the Bible and totally in sync with secular thinking on success. Despite good individual performances by the author and his two reading partners, the two extra voices are distracting. Avoidable technical glitches contribute to the impression that Hachette's producer lost control of this project somewhere along the way. T.W. © AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine"
