        "MCC Plus4 Hybrid grip with ALIGN Ribbed technology Made form cord and softer rubber Raised bottom ridge/rib for consistent hand placement Larger Lower Hand for lighter grip pressure Soft brushed cord compound upper for stability Softer rubber lower for comfort Available Colors: Grey Material BCT Cord Upper / Rubber Lower Core size 60 Ribbed Weight 67g Outside diameter Midsize RAISED RIDGE When installed on a shaft, the red ridge rises allowing for consistent hand placement, and heightened clubface awareness throughout the swing promotes a square clubface both at address and impact LARGER LOWER HAND The larger outside diameter simulates the feel of building up the grip with four extra wraps. This reduced taper encourages lighter grip pressure, promoting less tension in the hands and creating more fluidity and power throughout the swing. ALL-WEATHER CONTROL Our exclusive Brushed Cotton Cord fuses moisture-wicking cotton fibers into a new soft rubber material for added stability in any conditions. The Golf Pride MCC Plus4 Align grips are tour inspired with a larger lower hand design that simulates the feel of 4 extra layers of tape for lighter grip pressure and more power. ALIGN Technology now available in this hybrid grip is the first with a raised ridge, assisting hand alignment to square the club-face and improve your swing consistency."
