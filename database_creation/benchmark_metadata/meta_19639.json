        "In this road movie from Colombian filmmaker Ciro Guerra, Ignacio Carrillo (Marciano Martinez) has been a traveling musician most of his adult life, playing his accordion for anyone who will listen as he wanders from town to town. But after the death of his wife, Ignacio has fallen into a deep depression, and he decided to give up music. As he gives up his old way of life, Ignacio sets out on a journey to give his instrument back to the man who taught him to play many years before, but a young man named Fermin Morales (Yull Nunez) invites himself along for the ride. Ignacio doesn't have much use for Fermin, and while the young man is eager to learn the accordion, it's obvious he has no aptitude for music. But Fermin is persistent, and when bandits steal Ignacio's instrument, the youngster sees an opportunity to prove himself by recovering the lost accordion.",
