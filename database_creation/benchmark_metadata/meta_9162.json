        "Almost too terrified to grip the phone, Biddy Weir calls a daytime television show. The subject is bullying, and Biddy has a story to tell. Abandoned by her mother as a baby, Biddy lives in her own little world, happy to pass her time watching the birds—until Alison Fleming joins her school. Popular and beautiful, but with a dangerous, malevolent streak, Alison quickly secures the admiration of her fellow students. All except one. And Alison doesn't take kindly to people who don't fit her mold. A story of abuse and survival, of falling down and of starting again, and of one woman's battle to learn to love herself for who she is,",
