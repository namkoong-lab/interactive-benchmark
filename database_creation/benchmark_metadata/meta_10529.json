        "Spectacular, macabre post-Soviet Surf-rock instrumentals from behind the (former) Iron Curtain! St. Petersburg trio Messer Chups cook a delicious plate of exotic psycho-billy guitar jams and raucous rave-ups. Their fantastic new album is delivered direct from the heart of the Russian beast to you - Betty Page, Bela Lugosi and the Wolfman twanging and pounding their way to the nearest radioactive beach for a gang-bang with Joe Meek and Link Wray. A sleek late-model hybrid of trash and twang, remastered with 14 (!) glorious extra tracks for its very first ever release in the decadent West! Recorded at the 100% vintage analogue Estudios Circo Perrotti, Gijon, Spain. 20 page full color booklet with exclusive liner notes and photos."
