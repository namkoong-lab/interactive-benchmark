As civil liberties crumble, resistance is relegated to flyover country whose residents—derided as off-gridders—cling to the time-honored virtues of freedom, self-reliance, and charity.

        "About the Author",
        "J. P. Redding is a first-time author, former corporate executive, and retired entrepreneur in the field of software development.

        "From the Author",
        "I started the outline of OFF GRID almost five years ago. At the time, several themes of the novel were showing up on the radar screen: surveillance of US citizens, censorship at universities, socialism entering the mainstream, identity politics, biased journalism, the nanny state, etc. As the years ticked by, I realized that if I didn't take action, I would be writing a history book instead of near-future fiction.    Fast-forward to Summer 2019. I finally sent out my manuscript for review. They liked it! They also had lots of recommendations... Anyway, I took the plunge into deep edit mode. Little did I know how deep that mode was. My original release date of Fall 2019 slipped - too close to the holidays. Okay. Then the new target date of New Year slipped. Hmm. I gave it one more shot - Spring of 2020. What could go wrong?  The COVID-19 pandemic was a double-whammy for this fledgling author: all bookstores were closed and a key element of the novel's plot - a disaster - was already unfolding. But this worldwide disaster has highlighted the primary theme of OFF GRID: fear and control - the tools of the totalitarian State - are upon us. God help us all.",

Redding has a lifelong attachment to the state of Michigan both as a vacationer and resident. While majoring in Political Science at a major university, he delved into classical political philosophies as well as socialist and neo-Marxist theory (which he rejected). During college, Redding took a stab at creative writing by enrolling in an advanced seminar. The results were mixed: his fellow students were encouraging, the professor less so. Subsequently, he went on to receive a master’s degree in business administration.', 'Redding’s business experience ranges from corporate executive to startup entrepreneur. He had a 14-year career with a Fortune 100 company, gaining first-hand knowledge of large bureaucracies in a regulated industry. More recently, Redding co-founded a software business that he nurtured into an INC 500 Company – one of the fastest-growing, privately held companies in the U.S. He is an inventor with multiple patents.', 'Redding enjoys extreme watersports including windsurfing, kiteboarding, and SUP surfing. OFF GRID is his first novel.']}"
