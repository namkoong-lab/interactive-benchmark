        "\"I hope this book remains in print for a very long time to come, because everyone should read it.\" --",
        "Tom Kean, Chairman 9/11 Commission",
        "\"This volume defends the understanding, as also the horror, of that day. We are indebted for the effort and acuity.\" --",

        "From the Author",
        "The photos youre about to view have all been donated by gracious photographers, both amateur and professional. The stories youre about to read are distilled from interviews conducted in the year following September 11th, 2001. In every case, great effort was made to capture the speakers inimitable tone, viewpoint, and rhythm of speech. If, while reading, you begin to imagine what the speaker looks like, or the particular gestures he or she might make to illustrate a point  if the voice you are experiencing begins to take on a life of its own in your mind  then perhaps the books mission succeeded.",
        "This mission sprang from the disturbing notion that the memory of September 11th might one day quietly fade from the consciousness of the world. The fact is that our human history crawls through the sands of time like a snake towing a trowel in its wake. Despite the best efforts we exert to preserve our tracks, they inevitably disappear, wiped clean behind us or forever blurred into causal statements devoid of human feeling.",
        "Our species has an unsettling gift for boilerplating tragedy.",
        "So the mission for Tower Stories was to create a book that was personal, real, accessible and non-partisan - something that reflected human nature as it actually appeared on the 11th  full of foibles and hubris; fear and longing; community, sorrow, and yes, a considerable amount of pride where its warranted.",
        "From the Inside Flap",
        "No other book written about September 11th displays the compassion, the breadth of focus, and the exacting eye for historic detail that Tower Stories offers on every single page. In the tradition of Studs Terkels The Good War and the Roosevelt Administrations Slave Narratives, Damon DiMarco has offered a lasting literary contribution of inestimable importance to American culture. The policemen . . . the firemen . . . paramedics . . . witnesses . . . volunteers . . . business owners . . . theoreticians . . . the bereaved of 9/11 . . . herein their voices are preserved for all time. So that we, their contemporary countrymen and citizens of a peace-loving world can hear them and share in their intimate understanding of that horrible day.",
        "So that our children and grandchildren will inherit a point of reference from which to begin their quest for answers. In our fast-paced technological society, in a modern political world fraught with staggeringly complex international relations . . . today  more than ever before  there is a dire need to pause and bear witness. Our mission must be to never forget. Tower Stories fulfills this promise. By capturing the voices of the people who were there, it truly offers \"the autobiography of September 11th,\" the definitive account of the day that shaped the political landscape of the 21st century.",
