        "It seems like the days of flipping through vast vinyl, cassette, or CD collections is a thing of the past. And while there's no denying the convenience of having all your favorite albums on a mobile device, it's becoming more common for recordings to get lost in the shuffle and/or completely forgotten about. Author/journalist Greg Prato is willing to provide some assistance, with his 12th book overall, 'Overlooked/Underappreciated: 354 Recordings That Demand Your Attention.' Inside, you will find countless albums that you may have completely forgotten about or perhaps have never even heard of before. Either way, all 354 of these titles get the \"Prato Stamp of Approval.\" Starting with AC/DC's 'Flick of the Switch' and wrapping up with Zombi's 'Surface to Air,' countless styles of music are represented in between - rock n' roll, hard rock, heavy metal, alternative, new wave, punk, hardcore, grunge, jazz, fusion, psychedelic, prog, folk, blues, funk, soul, rap, spoken word, power pop, big band, glam, experimental, instrumental, soundtracks…the list goes on and on. But the selections stay strong!"

        "Overlooked/Underappreciated",
        "is one of those books that I'd recommend be on every rock lover's book shelf. There are scads of great reminders that will have you going back to your record collection to relive some great history, and it will open your eyes to avenues you've yet pursued. There's not a thing in the world wrong with quick, easy, and fun - and this book is definitely all of that.\" --Rock Guitar Daily with Tony Conley\"Comparing your own favorites with Prato's suggestions is simply fun to do, and likely readers of Prato's generation will enjoy it most. I'm glad to have the book in my collection and likely will indeed sample some of what Prato praises. You're never too old to rock, or learn more about it.\" --Wesley Britton, Blog Critics\"",
        "Overlooked/Underappreciated",
        "will appeal most to children of the 1970s and 1980s who may be unfamiliar with works that were not necessarily huge hits.  Prato offers some interesting selections, and at the very least will inspire spirited debate among readers.  Such disagreements and discussions rank among the best aspects of being avid music fans.\" --Kit O'Toole, cinemasentries.com\"",
        "Overlooked/Underappreciated: 354 Recordings That Demand Your Attention",
        "is a compelling and well-written book that will appeal to fans of nearly any musical genre.\" --Chad Bowar, About.com \"The way the material is presented makes for very easy, interruptible reading, especially on a train commute or for reading on a mobile device.\" --metalexpressradio.com\"Greg Prato packs a lot of information and opinion into this entertaining book. No reader will always agree with him, and few of us can claim to have musical tastes as diverse as the author's, but if you love rock & roll and reading about it, you'll like 'Overlooked/Underappreciated.' Highly recommended.\" --Ron Keel, Streets of Rock & Roll radio show host/musician\"With a list of 354, the chances are high that there is a little something for everyone. Personally, this writer has been inspired to try to take a listen to each of the albums listed.\" --Hilary Mahoney, Screamer Magazine\"A fun and informative book from one of the best rock journalists out there.\" --Steven Rosen, Curledup.com"
