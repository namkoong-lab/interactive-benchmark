        "This bamboo cutting board is a high quality, unique and memorable housewarming/special occasion gift. Bamboo is actually a grass, not a wood, and one of the fastest-growing plants on the planet. It’s often produced organically because it’s so easy to grow and, because of its quick growth, it’s a sustainable, highly renewable resource. The dense material of bamboo boards also prevents knife marks from being left behind on the board. That said, because the boards are so hard, they could potentially be damaging to your good knives, dulling them faster than softer wood boards could .Three boards size for all kitchen tasks. It’s a Bamboo Cutting Board, three size- a small board on a trip, a medium-sized one for small chopping tasks, and the big one during party meal prep. Three optimal sizes: 13.75”x10”x0.63”, 12.75”x10”x0.63”, 10.5”x8”x0.63”. The art of cooking begins with one of these cutting boards. These bamboo cutting boards for the kitchen have deep grooves that hold meat and fruit juices. Your workspace or kitchen will be clean and well-organized even during the busiest cooking moments."
