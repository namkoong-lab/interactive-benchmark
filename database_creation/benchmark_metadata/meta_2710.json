        "The transition to Viridian Gate Online (V.G.O.) is irreversible, and will kill Jack's corporeal form. And once players transition fully into the world of V.G.O., the risks aren't over—from cutthroat fellow players to greedy developers eager to replicate the wealth discrepancies of Earth in virtual reality, V.G.O. is just as dangerous as the 'real world' was.

        "All the books in the Viridian Gate Online Expanded Universe (currently, the Illusionist, Firebrand, the Heartfire Healer, the Alchemic Weaponner, the Artificer, and Sidequests) are all set as \"stand-alone\" series, meaning you can read any of the series without having to have read the others. The recommended reading order above is not set in stone; you can read the books in a different order (for example, Illusionist 1, Firebrand 1, then Alchemic Weaponeer 1). Hope this helps and welcome to the Largest LitRPG Expanded Universe around!",
