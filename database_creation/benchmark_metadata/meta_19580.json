        "Disney introduces a whole new kind of game with this interactive DVD game where children use their remote to play a virtual board game complete with spinner, game board, video clips, trivia questions, and interactive games. As newly crowned Princesses, players ages 5 to 8 are invited to enter an enchanted castle that features rooms inspired by Disney Princesses Ariel, Cinderella, Snow White, Mulan, Jasmine and Sleeping Beauty. One to four players take turns spinning the virtual spinner and moving through the castle's rooms where they answer trivia questions based on Disney Princess movies, play simple games, and encounter mystery spaces that often lead to hidden trap doors and secret slides. Correct answers and successful game play earn a Princess one of six items (invitation, carriage, gloves, shoes, dress, and tiara) that will prepare her to attend a royal ball. The first Princess who earns all the necessary items wins the game, but don't worry, all of the Princesses are invited to attend the ball at the end of the game. With over 250 different games, animations, activities, and trivia questions, players will likely experience a new game every time they play. A cynical parent might consider this game just an extended bonus feature without the accompanying video presentation, but young players are more likely to see it as an exciting new gaming medium.",
