From the military to money management to holistic health and kids, I have explored my heart, my choices, and the path my soul has asked me to travel.', 'My writing incoporates many of these things while integrating reality and the stumbling blocks we all face in our quest for the ultimate destination, love. I am in love with love. With all the heartache, joy, wonder and misery love brings to our lives, not one moment, breath, tear, or memory is wasted. It is our reason for being, and our greatest challenge.']}"
