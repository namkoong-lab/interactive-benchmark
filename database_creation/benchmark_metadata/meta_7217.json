She is thrust into a race to find a gritty, urban rapper before the \"Gangsta\" trend passes their label by. As Jill and her mostly middle-class coworkers search for the next big rap star, they fluctuate between alliances and rivalries, tripping over the stereotypes of race, class, and musical genre. They work to promote their current roster of acts as well as the new rap artist they sign to a contract. It turns out, he may not be what they expected. Full of original lyrics and wit,",

        "is the touching story of one idealistic young woman's journey into the music industry when it was at its multiplatinum peak. Holding onto those ideals is a challenge, but Garine Isassi's clear, smart, good-hearted storytelling is itself a blow against easy cynicism. She reveals a sharp eye for how quickly greed and self-interest can displace a love of music―and an equally sharp understanding of how a dedicated person's daily principled decisions can make sure that doesn't happen. It's a tale that's both poignant and uplifting.” ―Anthony DeCurtis, Contributing Editor,",

        "Start with the Backbeat",
        ", is one of the few books that give us a woman’s point of view of the music industry and an ethnically diverse range of characters. Set in the late ’80s, it tells the story of Jill Dodge, who, after several years as a temp in the Admin Pit (think, ‘armpit’) of Mega Big Records, is promoted to a staff position. The brisk pace and breezy style keep the reader turning pages as Jill struggles to maintain authenticity in the face of clueless execs, romantic snafus, and a wannabe rapper. Isassi skewers the racism and sexism at the core of the industry with a light touch while evoking the deep love of music that drives each of her delightfully unique characters.” ―Céline Keating, author of",
