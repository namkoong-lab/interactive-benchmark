        "Buyer Beware: Many companies selling are not USA based companies. Purelife Enema is an American Company since 2013. Some companies are misleading the public in order to make sales. They are claiming that Gold Roast Enema Coffee ( a gold color) is the only \"Real\" enema coffee. This is very very far from the truth and is actually very untrue. We have worked closely with Gerson Institute Doctors. The right coffee for an enema that Gerson recommended was in fact Medium or Light Roast. But not the Gold Roast. It is found that darker roasted coffee restored blood levels of the antioxidants vitamin E and glutathione more effectively. The darker roasts are said to stimulate bile production and increase glutathione. This is important because glutathione is often considered to be the master antioxidant that controls multiple phases of detoxification! Our coffee is made fresh daily and never stored in a fulfillment center. It is also mold and fungus free, and 100% free of pesticides. PureLife uses only \"specialty grade\" beans. Never Robusta beans which are inferior. Enema Coffee should be air roasted and never drum roasted. Drum roasting can cause beans to burn, leaving a toxic residue that you don't want in your body. Enema Coffee should be 100% Certified Organic beans, and not a blend. The certification should be on the label of the coffee. Purelife Enema Coffee is better Coffee, not only because ours is mold and fungus free, but because we use the special air roast method. Purelife Enema Coffee is recommended by Gerson Institute and is for the purpose of detoxing the liver . Enema Coffee opens up the bile ducts in the liver, so the stored up chemicals and toxins can be released through the blood stream, leaving you feeling better. Coffee enemas have been known also to reduce inflammation in the body."
