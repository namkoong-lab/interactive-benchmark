        "Australia released, NTSC/Region 0 DVD: LANGUAGES: English ( Dolby Digital 2.0 ), WIDESCREEN (1.78:1), SPECIAL FEATURES: Interactive Menu, Remastered, Scene Access, SYNOPSIS: A guy gets fired from a big film distribution company and plans to buy his own movie room on an old cinema. He and his friends decide to premiére with the last movie to be shown before the cinema closed. It's an italian peplum about mixed adventures of Hercules, Samson and other classical and mythological heroes. But the big company plots against them and gets them a copy of the movie without subtitles or voice overs. And they only find this out at the very last moment before the movie starts. They have to improvise and invent dialogues screamed from the projectionists room to the audience. This ends up in a delirious mix of footage from the old movie with crazy comic dialogues from today. Great comedy. ...Hercules Returns (1993)"
