        "Echinacea purpurea Root (American Coneflower) has been used for centuries by the Native American tribes to assist the healing process for skin conditions and improve immune system function. This herb assists through its complex sugars, Polysaccharides and Echinaceosides, that support a healthy immune system as well as help improve sinus and respiratory processes. This is the highest quality Echinacea purpurea Root (4% Extract) available on the market in raw, powder form. It is a light-to-medium-brown powder. PFL Non-GMO Pesticide Free powder extracts are not ETO Treated or Gamma Irradiated. Some typically gummy, oily or damp extracts require an anti-caking agent to maintain its powder form. Non-GMO and/or Organic Tapioca maltodextrins are typically used, in as small amounts as possible. If used, PFL will list it on our label. Most extracts require its use, whether other suppliers disclose it or not. Review the safety article at Prescribed For Life for more information."
