        "Have you considered why God brought you and your spouse together in marriage, beyond the basic understanding that you love each other? There is a deeper dimension to your marriage. There is a greater glory to your relationship. A prophetic marriage is a relationship with a specific vision―one that brings you closer to each other and to your heavenly Father.",
