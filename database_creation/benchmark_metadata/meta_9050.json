This delightful activity-kit-in-a-book includes everything kids ages 3 to 8 need to set up an amazing vet clinic and enjoy hours of fun playing doctor. There are pop-out signs to mount in the waiting room; adorably illustrated prescription forms, exam checklists, and appointment reminders to fill out; a nurse's cap to punch out and assemble; four sheets of colorful stickers; and more! The book also offers 15 simple and fun DIY projects to make with common household items, including a thermometer made from a pencil, a lab coat made from an old t-shirt, and a hospital bed made from a cardboard box."
