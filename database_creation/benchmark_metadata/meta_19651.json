        "\"'Cameo' Kirby\" is a drama, adventure and romance. A swashbuckling gambler with a good heart sees his carefree world turn upside down when another player swindles an unsuspecting victim out of his fortune and causes his demise. This is the first film in which director John Ford was credited with this name. Previously he had been known as \"Jack Ford\". The film is also notable for the screen debut of the future great Jean Arthur. By the standards of the average silent film \"'Cameo' Kirby\" has acceptable quality and is perfectly watchable. The movie is accompanied by quality music that greatly enhances the viewing experience. The DVD comes in a slim jewel case and has the cover art exactly as you see it on the photo.
