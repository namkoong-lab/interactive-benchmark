        "In social work there is seldom an uncontroversial `right way′ of doing things. So how will you deal with the value questions and ethical dilemmas that you will be faced with as a professional social worker?",
        "This lively and readable introductory text is designed to equip students with a sound understanding of the principles of values and ethics which no social worker should be without. Bridging the gap between theory and practice, this book successfully explores the complexities of ethical issues, while recognising the real-world context in which social workers operate.",
        "Key features of the text include:",
        "- Full of hands-on advice and tips for professional practice.",
        "- Engaging and student-friendly. Each chapter is packed with case studies, reader exercises, key definitions and useful summaries.",
        "- Comprehensive content. The book explores core issues such as moral philosophy; professionalism; religion; power; oppression; difference and diversity; and ethical codes of practice.",
        "- Satisfies all the curriculum and training requirements for the new social work degree.",
        "Mapping directly on to first year courses, this text is essential reading for all social work undergraduates. It is an ideal refresher text for upper-level undergraduates, postgraduate and post-qualifying students, and for professionals.",
        "`This introductory text succeeds in providing an accessible introduction to the subject area. The book is consistently structured, well planned and uniformly written in a conversational and immediate style…. The discussion manages to combine a sense of engagement with a balanced treatment of the issues. Readers who apply themselves will be well sensitised to the matters under discussion and should be able to take their understanding into the practical arena′ -",

        "Review",
        "\"This book is a worthy addition to the literature, and anyone who is engaged in educating students regarding values and ethics would likely find it useful. This text is successful at \"starting where the student is\" when entering into the often charged territory of values. Backett and Maynard have understood clearly that students often need more guidance in examining their own values and assumptions, and how these lead us to very different ways of thinking about ethical dilemmas. It would be a helpful resource in approaching the teaching of values and ethics in social work.\"",
