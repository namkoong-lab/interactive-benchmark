    "description": [
        "Reinforcing Wire Mesh is designed to be used with FiberFlex rod and can be used on any type of thermoplastic repair. We recommend that mesh be used when a tear goes to the edge of the plastic. Putting the wire mesh into the plastic is like putting rebar into concrete… it makes the repair much stronger. It's made from stainless steel, so it's five times stronger than regular aluminum wire screen. You can also use the mesh to fabricate tabs, fill holes, and provide reinforcement in any thermoplastic (meltable plastic). Each sheet of mesh is 5 inches (12.7 cm) by 10 inches (25 cm)."
