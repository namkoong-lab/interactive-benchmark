        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Where America the Beautiful (see review, p. 77) pays tribute to the 50 states, Harrison's handsome picture book is a praise song in honor of \"this beautiful land to the north . . . to me a land of color and wonder.\" Each province and territory in Canada is described in page-length text and facing illustration. Short on dates and other historical facts--perhaps because the book was originally published in Canada, where inclusion of such information might have seemed redundant--the text emphasizes Harrison's personal tastes. His sensibility, while good-spirited, may not export easily: young American readers won't understand many of Harrison's casual references. For example, when discussing Prince Edward Island, he states, without explanation, \"Friendships last a lifetime, just as they did in the time of Anne of Green Gables .\" Harrison's acrylics are whimsically stylized: mounted police, reindeer, a lighthouse, a quaint Nova Scotia cottage, mountains emerging in bold compositions of pinks, blues, yellows and orange. The effect is much like a series of appliqueed quilts. Other volumes may show more of the actual Canada in photographs, but this book winningly portrays one man's vision of the land he loves. A final spread includes the music and lyrics, both English and French, to the anthem \"O Canada.\" Ages 5-7. Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "Gr. 2-5. Although the national anthem \"O Canada\" appears at the end of the book, along with piano music and French as well as English texts, this is not an illustrated version of the song, but a province-by-province tour of the country. Harrison, who has also illustrated",

        "(1988) with his haunting artwork, here paints in his signature style: colored-line drawings filled in with unshaded tones, subtle and distinctive combinations of hues, and rhythmic repetition of shapes and lines. On each left-hand page are a few paragraphs about the land and people of the province or territory, while on the facing page is a large painting, generally a landscape or seascape with occasional figures of people or animals. For facts on Canada, get the encyclopedia; for a brief, beautiful introduction to the provinces and territories, get this book.",

        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "A brief, affectionate statement about Canada as a whole prefaces a similar page on each of its provinces, mentioning natural resources, characterizing the population, and pointing out distinctive qualities. The real purpose of these rather personal overviews is to caption Harrison's powerfully stylized paintings, with rich purple-blues, pinks, and oranges that might have been derived from the northern lights. Harrison may be remembered for his powerful paintings for Robert Service's poems (e.g., The Shooting of Dan McGrew, 1988); the bold, graphic art here is in the same spirit. An idiosyncratic, unusually striking book. Canada's national anthem is included. (Nonfiction/Picture book. 6-10) --",
