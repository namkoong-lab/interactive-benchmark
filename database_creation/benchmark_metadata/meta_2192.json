        "Ellis Rogers is an ordinary man who is about to embark on an extraordinary journey. All his life he has played it safe and done the right thing, but when diagnosed with a terminal illness, he's willing to take an insane gamble. He's built a time machine in his garage, and if it works, he’ll face a world that challenges his understanding of what it means to be human, what it takes to love, and the cost of paradise. Ellis could find more than a cure for his disease; he might find what everyone has been searching for since time began — but only if he can survive the Hollow World.Welcome to the future and a new science fiction thriller from the bestselling author of the Riyria Revelations and the Riyria Chronicles. Sullivan's novels have been translated into fifteen foreign languages, and have been selected for more than ninety-five best of the year or most anticipated lists, including those compiled by Library Journal, Barnes & Noble.com, and Goodreads.",

        "\"This book made me laugh. It also made me cry. And in the end, it made me think. I highly recommend Hollow World for anyone looking for a book that brushes on and plays out some political and social issues we face today.\"",
        "-- N.E. White, sffworld.com",
        "\"Hollow World is so many things, but without a doubt, the best part about it is also its most obvious duality: that is it at once a light and entertaining read, but also heavy on important issues and philosophy.\"",
        "-- Stephenie Sheung, Bibliosanctum",
        "\"I'm happy to report that not only does Hollow World establish Sullivan as a force to be reckoned with in any genre he chooses to ply his talent to, it also is a prime example of one of the reasons speculative fiction is so important.\"",
        "-- Matt Gilliard, 52 Book Reviews",
        "\"A modernized classic, Hollow World is the perfect novel for both new and nostalgic science fiction readers.\"",
        "-- Justin Landon, Staffer's Book Reviews",
        "\"This is a clever and thought-provoking story, with loads of interesting ideas, some adrenalin-pumping action and plenty of humour.\"",
        "-- Pauline M. Ross, Fantasy Review Barn",
        "\"I fully expected this to be a good speculative read; I had not expected it to be one of those rare literary gems that exceed the speculative genre to become worthy of any English literature class.\"",
        "-- Stephan van Velzen, Ranting Dragon",
        "\"These powerful questions that Sullivan explores about existence, love, and trials make Hollow World one of the deeper and enjoyable stories of 2014. Hollow World is a highly recommended time-travel story and a must read for anyone who loves the nostalgia of their first adventure into the possibilities of past and future.\"",

        "is a story I never meant to write. At any given time I have seven or eight novels sitting in a queue waiting their turn, and",
        "Hollow World",
        "wasn't one of them. It started out because of an anthology called",
        "The End--Visions of Apocalypse",
        "edited by N. E. White. Nila runs writing contests on sffworld and wanted to put out an anthology to showcase some new writers. She asked me and a few other established authors to act as anchors in the hopes of a wider readership. The first short story I wrote for her sparked what would become",
        "Hollow World,",
        "which really wanted to be a full-length novel. So I wrote a new story for Nila (",
        "Burning Alexandria",
        ") and pushed aside all my other projects to write this \"book of the heart\" that got into my head and wouldn't let me go.When I started writing",
        "Hollow World",
        ", I suspected getting it published would be challenging. First, I'm established in epic fantasy, so crossing genres and moving into science fiction isn't what my (or I suspected other) publishers would be interested in.  Also, it is very much a cross-genre piece containing elements of science fiction, a heroes journey, and even a murder mystery all in a single book. To make matters worse, it deals with controversial subjects which I won't get into here as I don't want any spoilers. Last, but not least, it has a classic, retro vibe of the science fiction I loved in my youth, and I was told that the current market was focusing on space opera and military science fiction.None of this deterred me. As with my other books, I was writing something I wanted to read. While I hoped there would be those that would want to read it, too, that was secondary to the fact that I just \"had\" to tell this story. I had already been successfully self-published in the past, and I was more than willing to do that again in order to get this book in front of readers. As it turned out, I got a nice five-figure offer for the book...but (the devil isn't in the details, it's in the buts) that publisher wanted full rights: print, ebook, and audio.  I REALLY wanted to keep the ebook rights so I turned that down and went in search of a \"print-only\" deal.For those that don't know, there have only been a few \"print-only\" deals...and all of them by authors who sell at blockbuster levels (Hugh Howey, Brandon Sanderson, Bella Andre, and Coleen Hoover). But I figured nothing ventured nothing gained, so my agent approached Tachyon Publishing (who did Brandon Sanderson's print-only deal for his Hugo winning",

From that very first line he was consumed by the desire to fill blank pages and see what doors the typewriter keys would unlock. Serious writing started after high school and Michael spent ten years developing his craft and riding the query-go-round. During that time, he wrote twelve novels, and after finding no traction in publishing, he gave up and vowed never to write creatively again. Michael discovered that never was a really long time and ended his hiatus a decade later but only on the condition that he wouldn't seek publication. His intention was to write stories just for himself and to help foster a love of reading in his dyslexic daughter. After reading his early Riyria books, his wife made other plans.

They were like that when we found them.”“And you’re part of the same group?”“Gale University—I’m leading a class in ancient history. We were on a field trip.”“All right, you can do us a favor and just continue with that. Stay clear of this side of the park, okay?”“Is it really a Darwin?”“We don’t know what we’re dealing with yet, so please give us room.”Ellis opened his eyes and found the blue sky, now decorated with pretty balls of white cotton. The light was different, the sun having moved well to the west so that the trees and farmhouse were casting long shadows. His chest was better. He could breathe again, yet everything else felt sore.“Pax—open eyes here.”“Okay, everyone just relax.” The person speaking was the closest of those around him, but still about thirty feet away.A dozen people had gathered near the old farmhouse, two standing closer than the rest and all looking identical. Each shared the same soft face with big, dark eyes, short noses, and tan-brown skin as if some Middle Eastern mother had popped out an Irish Catholic-sized brood of identical duodecaplets.They were all dressed oddly, with several not dressed at all. Some just wore hats, or scarves, or coats. One was dressed all in bright yellow. Another had a full ensemble of red and white stripes—right down to shoes, which made Ellis think of Dr. Seuss. None of them had a single strand of hair, and just like the first pair of androgynous manikins, these new visitors also appeared to have been made by Mattel.Ellis wondered if he was having a dream of the",

Both spoke in the same fashion as the others.“Give me a minute, okay,” the closer of the two replied. He, she, or it wore a full set of clothes, at least. Some strange getup pulled from a Sherlock Holmes story consisting of a long black frock coat, silver vest, white trousers, wing shirt, gray tie, and a bowler hat. Maybe Ellis had accidentally crashed a wedding or really had gone back in time. So what if Hoffmann didn’t think it was possible.“Pax! Don’t go near it. If that’s a Darwin, we don’t know what it’ll do. It’s already killed one person.”",

That spark ignited a flame, and Michael\\'s desire to fill blank pages became a life-long obsession. As an adult, Michael spent more than ten years developing his craft by studying authors such as Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, and John Steinbeck. During that time, he wrote thirteen novels but found no interest from the publishing industry. Since insanity is repeating the same action while expecting a different result, he made the rational choice and quit, vowing never to write creatively again.', 'Never turned out to be too long for Michael, and after a decade, he returned to the keyboard in his forties, but with one condition: He wouldn\\'t seek publication. Instead, he wrote a series of books that had been building in his head during his hiatus. His first reading love was fantasy, and he hoped to foster a similar reaction in his then thirteen-year-old daughter who struggled due to dyslexia. After reading the third book of this series, his wife insisted that the novels had to \"get out there.\" When Michael refused to jump back onto the query-go-round, Robin took over the publication tasks, and she has run the business side of his writing ever since.', 'Currently, Michael has released eighteen novels (and written twenty): The Riyria Revelations (6 books in 3 two-book omnibus editions from Orbit), The Riyria Chronicles (2 books from Orbit and 2 indie-published), Legends of the First Empire (3 books from Del Rey and 3 indie-published), Rise and Fall (Nolyn (2021, Farilane (coming 2022), Esrhadon (coming 2023) and a standalone science fiction thriller called Hollow World (from Tachyon Publications).', 'The next Riyria novel, Drumindor, has been green-lighted, but no publication date has been released.', 'Michael is one of the few authors who has successfully published through all three routes: small press, self, and big five.
