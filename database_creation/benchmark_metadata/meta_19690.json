        "Buzzy (Edward Burns, Purple Violets, The Brothers McMullen) and Katie (Caitlin Fitzgerald, It s Complicated) are a newly married couple living a seemingly conflict-free life. But when Buzzy s damaged and impulsive half-sister Linda (Kerry Bishe, Nice Guy Johnny) arrives at their doorstep expecting to stay for an indefinite period in their Tribeca loft, her antics threaten to disrupt the couple s commitment to an easy marriage. Meanwhile, with Katie s sister Marsha (Marsha Dietlein Bennett, Little Children) projecting suspicions of her own husband s infidelity onto Buzzy, will the couple s formerly trusting and insulated life be able to withstand the dysfunctions of their respective siblings?",
