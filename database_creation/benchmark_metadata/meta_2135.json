        "“The most thrilling and tingling kind of science fiction story.”—Kirkus Reviews“Heinlein found his true direction…. The Martian setting is logically constructed and rich in convincing detail [while] the characters are engaging and the action develops naturally.”—Jack WilliamsonMarking the first appearance of the Martian elder race that played such a prominent role in Stranger in a Strange Land, Robert A. Heinlein’s iconic Red Planet tells the story of Jim Marlowe and Frank Sutton’s journey to the Lowe Academy boarding school on Mars, and the discoveries they make there that could impact the future of their entire colony.While on their way to the prestigious school, Jim and Frank, along with Jim’s volleyball-sized native pet, Willis the Bouncer, meets one of the sentient Martians, Gekko, when they wander into forbidden territory. Joining in a ritual called “growing together” and sharing water with the three-legged Martian, making them “water friends,” the boy’s eyes are opened to the wonders of the planet they call home and are curious about how protective the Martians are over Willis, who chooses to stay with Jim, despite the gentle urgings of the larger aliens.Finally enrolled in school, Jim’s independent nature and impulsive tendency to speak his mind gets him into trouble with the authoritarian headmaster, Mr. Howe, who confiscates Willis, claiming it is against school rules to have pets. When the boys go to rescue him, they get more than they are bargained for when the little Bouncer’s eidetic memory for sounds—which he can accurately reproduce like a recording—reveals the colonial administrator of Mars’ nefarious plan for the colony, which he overheard during his confinement.The implications of this newfound knowledge, as well as their need to protect Willis from the unscrupulous Mr. Howe, prompt the boys to run away from school, to warn their parents and the rest of their colony. What they encounter along the way not only has them questioning everything they know, about Willis and the mysterious Martian race, but the ramifications of their actions are more profound in this edition of Red Planet, which has restored the ending Robert A. Heinlein had originally intended to be published."

        "Heinlein's 1949 novel of a space frontier culture is brought to life with Full Cast Audio's signature quality of talented voices and an evocative musical score. The colonists live a fragile existence on Mars as they try to survive without offending the native Martians—while satisfying the Corporation's hunger for profit. But greed throws this delicate balance off, and young Jim and Frank with their Martian friend, Willis, must negotiate their way among the opposing groups in order to keep their families safe and the Martians content. The masterful William Dufris, director and main narrator, pulls listeners into the stories with his deep, smooth voice. The energetic cast provides colorful voices for the quirky characters without overacting. The musical score helps with transitions as well as setting the mood and declaratively ending a scene.",

        "Like many people, I go way, way back with Heinlein. My very favorite book (and one that stands out in my mind--and with much affection--to this day) is Tunnel in the Sky. I really, really wanted to go off to explore new worlds with a covered wagon and horses, like the hero does at the very end of the book. But one of the nice things about Robert Heinlein is that he's got something for everyone. One of my best friends has a different favorite: Podkayne of Mars. Go figure.                        --Shelly Shapiro, Executive Editor",

        "Willis The thin air of Mars was chill but not really cold. It was not yet winter in southern latitudes and the daytime temperature was usually above freezing. The queer creature standing outside the door of a dome-shaped building was generally manlike in appearance, but no human being ever had a head like that. A thing like a coxcomb jutted out above the skull, the eye lenses were wide and staring, and the front of the face stuck out in a snout. The unearthly appearance was increased by a pattern of black and yellow tiger stripes covering the entire head. The creature was armed with a pistol-type hand weapon slung at its belt and was carrying, crooked in its right arm, a ball, larger than a basketball, smaller than a medicine ball. It moved the ball to its left arm, opened the outer door of the building and stepped inside. Inside was a very small anteroom and an inner door. As soon as the outer door was closed the air pressure in the anteroom began to rise, accompanied by a soft sighing sound. A loudspeaker over the inner door shouted in a booming bass, “Well? Who is it? Speak up! Speak up!” The visitor placed the ball carefully on the floor, then with both hands grasped its ugly face and pushed and lifted it to the top of its head. Underneath was disclosed the face of an Earth-human boy. “It’s Jim Marlowe, Doc,” he answered. “Well, come in. Come in! Don’t stand out there chewing your nails.” “Coming.” When the air pressure in the anteroom had equalized with the pressure in the rest of the house the inner door opened automatically. Jim said, “Come along, Willis,” and went on in. The ball developed three spaced bumps on its lower side and followed after him, in a gait which combined spinning, walking, and rolling. More correctly, it careened, like a barrel being manhandled along a dock. They went down a passage and entered a large room that occupied half the floorspace of the circular house plan. Doctor MacRae looked up but did not get up. “Howdy, Jim. Skin yourself. Coffee on the bench. Howdy, Willis,” he added and turned back to his work. He was dressing the hand of a boy about Jim’s age. “Thanks, Doc. Oh—hello, Francis. What are you doing here?” “Hi, Jim. I killed a water-seeker, then I cut my thumb on one of its spines.” “Quit squirming!” commanded the doctor. “That stuff stings,” protested Francis. “I meant it to. Shut up.” “How in the world did you do that?” persisted Jim. “You ought to know better than to touch one of those things. Just burn ’em down and burn ’em up.” He zipped open the front of his outdoor costume, peeled it off his arms and legs and hung it on a rack near the door. The rack held Francis’s suit, the headpiece of which was painted in bright colors like an Indian brave’s war paint, and the doctor’s suit, the mask of which was plain. Jim was now stylishly and appropriately dressed for indoors on Mars—bare naked save for bright red jockey shorts. “I did burn it,” explained Francis, “but it moved when I touched it. I wanted to get the tail to make a necklace.” “Then you didn’t burn it right. Probably left it full of live eggs. Who’re you making a necklace for?” “None of your business. And I did so burn the egg sac. What do you take me for? A tourist?” “Sometimes I wonder. You know those things don’t die until sundown.” “Don’t talk nonsense, Jim,” the doctor advised. “Now, Frank, I’m going to give you an anti-toxin shot. ’Twon’t do you any good but it’ll make your mother happy. Long about tomorrow your thumb will swell up like a poisoned pup; bring it back and I’ll lance it.” “Am I going to lose my thumb?” the boy asked. “Nope. But you’ll do your scratching with your left hand for a few days. Now, Jim, what brings you here? Bellyache?” “No, Doc. It’s Willis.” “Willis, eh? He looks pert enough to me.” The doctor stared down at the creature. Willis was at his feet, having come up to watch the dressing of Frank’s thumb. To do so he had protruded three eye stalks from the top of his spherical mass. The stalks stuck up like thumbs, in an equal-sided triangle, and from each popped a disturbingly human eye. The little fellow turned around slowly on his tripod of bumps, or pseudopeds, and gave each of his eyes a chance to examine the doctor. “Get me a cup of Java, Jim,” commanded the doctor, then leaned over and made a cradle of his hands. “Here, Willis—upsi-daisy!” Willis gave a little bounce and landed in the doctor’s hands, withdrawing all protuberances as he did so. The doctor lifted him to the examining table; Willis promptly stuck out legs and eyes again. They stared at each other. The doctor saw a ball covered with thick, close-cropped fur, like sheared sheepskin, and featureless at the moment save for supports and eye stalks. The Mars creature saw an elderly male Earthman almost completely covered with wiry grey-and-white hair. The hair was thin on top, thick on chin and cheeks, moderately thick to sparse on chest and arms and back and legs. The middle portion of this strange unMartian creature was concealed in snow-white shorts. Willis enjoyed looking at him. “How do you feel, Willis?” inquired the doctor. “Feel good? Feel bad?” A dimple showed at the very crown of the ball between the stalks, dilated to an opening. “Willis fine!” he said. His voice was remarkably like Jim’s. “Fine, eh?” Without looking around the doctor added, “Jim! Wash those cups again. And this time, sterilize them. Want everybody around here to come down with the pip?” “Okay, Doc,” Jim acknowledged, and added to Francis, “You want some coffee, too?” “Sure. Weak, with plenty of cow.” “Don’t be fussy.” Jim dipped into the laboratory sink and managed to snag another cup. The sink was filled with dirty dishes. Nearby a large flask of coffee simmered over a Bunsen burner. Jim washed three cups carefully, put them through the sterilizer, then filled them. Doctor MacRae accepted a cup and said, “Jim, this citizen says he’s okay. What’s the trouble?” “I know he says he’s all right, Doc, but he’s not. Can’t you examine him and find out?” “Examine him? How, boy? I can’t even take his temperature because I don’t know what his temperature ought to be. I know as much about his body chemistry as a pig knows about patty-cake. Want me to cut him open and see what makes him tick?” Willis promptly withdrew all projections and became as featureless as a billiard ball. “Now you’ve scared him,” Jim said accusingly. “Sorry.” The doctor reached out and commenced scratching and tickling the furry ball. “Good Willis, nice Willis. Nobody’s going to hurt Willis. Come on, boy, come out of your hole.” Willis barely dilated the sphincter over his speaking diaphragm. “Not hurt Willis?” he said anxiously in Jim’s voice. “Not hurt Willis. Promise.” “Not cut Willis?” “Not cut Willis. Not a bit.” The eyes poked out slowly. Somehow he managed an expression of watchful caution, though he had nothing resembling a face. “That’s better,” said the doctor. “Let’s get to the point, Jim. What makes you think there’s something wrong with this fellow, when he and I can’t see it?” “Well, Doc, it’s the way he behaves. He’s all right indoors, but outdoors—He used to follow me everywhere, bouncing around the landscape, poking his nose into everything.” “He hasn’t got a nose,” Francis commented. “Go to the head of the class. But now, when I take him out, he just goes into a ball and I can’t get a thing out of him. If he’s not sick, why does he act that way?” “I begin to get a glimmering,” Doctor MacRae answered. “How long have you been teamed up with this balloon?” Jim thought back over the twenty-four months of the Martian year. “Since along toward the end of Zeus, nearly November.” “And now here it is the last of March, almost Ceres, and the summer gone. That suggest anything to your mind?” “Uh, no.” “You expect him to go hopping around through the snow? We migrate when it gets cold; he lives here.” Jim’s mouth dropped open. “You mean he’s trying to hibernate?” “What else? Willis’s ancestors have had a good many millions of years to get used to the seasons around here; you can’t expect him to ignore them.” Jim looked worried. “I had planned to take him with me to Syrtis Minor.” “Syrtis Minor? Oh, yes, you go away to school this year, don’t you? You, too, Frank.” “You bet!” “I can’t get used to the way you kids grow up. It was just last week I was painting your thumb to keep you from sucking it.” “I never sucked my thumb!” Francis answered. “No? Then it was some other kid. Never mind. I came to Mars so that the years would be twice as long, but it doesn’t seem to make any difference.” “Say, Doc, how old are you?” inquired Francis. “Mind your own business. Which one of you is going to study medicine and come back to help me with my practice?” Neither one answered. “Speak up, speak up!” urged the doctor. “What are you going to study?”",

Heinlein’s books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time he died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.",

        "Written in 1949, RED PLANET shows its age with some sexism and anachronistic phrases. Still, the tale is fast and action-packed. Among the first colonists on Mars are teens Jim and Pete and their families. The human colonists live in peace with the mysterious Martians but have a conflict with their government. Narrator William Dufris holds all the excitement together. The actors for Jim and Pete have bright, energetic voices and move things right along. The rest of the cast fills things in nicely, voicing crotchety doctors, noble parents, duplicitous bureaucrats, impatient men of action, and mysterious Martians. In this full-cast treatment, the production would be an excellent choice for a family car trip. G.D. © AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine",
