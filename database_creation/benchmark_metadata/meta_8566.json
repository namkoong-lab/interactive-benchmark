        ", the text builds tremendous compassion for the Soviets, who suffered unequaled death and devastation during World War II. Staggering statistics (the U.S and Britain each lost between 300,000 and 400,000 soldiers; Russia's loss exceeded 11 million), highly readable prose, and an attractive layout work together to draw students into this absorbing study of a country that was one of the West's greatest allies--and enemies--during the twentieth century. The information has appropriate depth for high-school research, and chapter subsections divide the text into smaller units that make it manageable for middle-school researchers. Both books include a double-page map, a chronology, and a glossary, as well as careful chapter notes and a bibliography.",
