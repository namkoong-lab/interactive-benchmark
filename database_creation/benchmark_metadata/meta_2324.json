She obtained an MS in forensic science at the University of New Haven and returned to her native New Mexico to work with the New Mexico State Police as a forensic chemist and crime scene responder. A few years later, she ventured north to Los Alamos National Laboratory. She returned to university at New Mexico State where she obtained her PhD in chemistry and completed a post-doctoral appointment. The first academic stop was Eastern Washington University in the chemistry department and then to West Virginia University where she finished up her working days as the Chair of the Forensic Science Department.\", \"Suzanne's love of emerged as an outlet during the mostly self-imposed pressures of the doctoral program. Composing reams of mediocre unpublished fiction sparked a love of the writing which led to non-fiction titles and textbooks. Multiple editions later, the joy remains.\"]}"
