        "This is the story of the American soldiers who fought America's first ground battle of World War II--the Battle of Bataan. Includes maps and photos.Immediately after Pearl Harbor the United States Army Forces in the Far East, commanded by legendary general Douglas MacArthur, found themselves trapped on the Bataan Peninsula and nearby Corregidor Island. They held out for months, hoping for supplies and reinforcements from the United States, but eventually were starved out and forced to surrender to the Japanese. 70,000 American and Filipino soldiers became prisoners of war (POW) and were condemned to the Bataan Death March and horrible Japanese prison camps. However, a few Americans escaped into the jungle and vowed to continue the fight as guerrillas until they could be rescued. These men would be missing in action (MIA) for more than three years. Less than half of them survived.Bataan Diary is the true story of Lt. Col. Frank R. Loyd and a small group of soldiers who fought though the Battle of Bataan, then battled starvation, terrible diseases, and a Japanese manhunt sent to capture them. While the men lived by their wits and their survival skills in the jungles of the Philippines, their families in the States raised funds for the war, worked in government jobs, and prayed for their survival not knowing if the men were alive or dead. Bataan Diary is based on the wartime diaries of Frank Loyd, his wife Evelyn, and diaries, correspondence and interviews with other survivors. Bataan Diary delivers a whole new aspect of the war in the Pacific, and an inspiring glimpse into the determination of these soldiers and their families in the midst of terrible circumstances."

I am an Associate Instructor at the Osher Learning Institute at the University of Utah and teach classes on Middle East History and World War II. I also serve as Public Relations Officer for the Philippine Scouts Heritage Society.', 'My first book was \"Bataan Diary,\" published in 2004, about a group of American soldiers left behind in the Philippine Islands during World War II. This is a really unusual story which follows the lives of families at home in the States as well as the story of the soldiers abandoned in the Philippine jungles during the Japanese occupation. It is, of course, available on Amazon.com.', 'Last year I completed a documentary screenplay for movie producer Donald A. Plata, named \"Forgotten Soldiers.\" The movie is about the U.S. Army\\'s Philippine Scouts in World War II. The movie has been completd and Mr. Plata plans to enter it into several film festivals during the latter part of 2011 and early 2012, after which we hope that it will be shown to the general public on PBS and the DVD will be available for purchase on Amazon. I am also writing a book, \"Forgotten Soldiers,\" to be released with the movie.', 'If you are interested in terrorism and other troubles in the Middle East, you will want to read my third book, as yet unnamed, about the treaties that ended World War I and how those treaties have led to our difficulties in the Middle East today. The book is in the latter stages of its research phase, but I am beginning to outline and write the chapters, sandwiched in between the \"Forgotten Soldiers\" project mentioned above.', 'Previously, I served for twenty-two years as president and lead consultant at Chris Schaefer & Company, a computer software and consulting firm with clients in North America, Europe, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. In 1998 I was fortunate to be able to hand over the reins of the company and turn my full-time attention to historical research and writing.', 'I hope you have enjoyed \"Bataan Diary,\" and will find the \"Forgotten Soldiers\" movie and the Middle East book even more interesting.']}"
