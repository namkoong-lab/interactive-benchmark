        "What do you do when your best friend has an affair with your husband of twenty-five years?",
        "Well, you pack your bags, grab half of the equity in the house you've both lovingly restored and run away to an idyllic little cottage in the country.",
        "Only, it’s not quite so idyllic when",
        "1) Rustic charm sounds rather romantic, but the reality is something else …",
        "2) The heavens decide to open on moving day and the rain just keeps on coming",
        "Maddie Brooks grits her teeth and hires the highly recommended 'man who can', ex-soldier, Lewis Hart. As he rips out the very shabby, and decidedly not-so-chic kitchen, reality sets in. Not only is he the most abrupt person she's ever met, but the man is a Neanderthal!",

        "Hitting the big five-o is the final straw. No presents, family or friends—just infuriating Lewis, who can’t leave because the flood has now cut off his exit. How on earth is she going to get through this and put her life back together?",
        "Can Maddie Brooks become that ‘fifty-and-fabulous’ woman of her dreams?"
