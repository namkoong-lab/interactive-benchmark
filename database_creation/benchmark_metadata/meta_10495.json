        "Product Description",
        "It has an uplifting spirit to the album and is in more of the realm of artistic expression than it is categorically an \"Ambient\" album. Trajectories has 7 great ambient songs that are lush and vibrant. This music is alive and a deep sense of wonder and amazement is felt throughout the entire album. There are guitars and of course very layered ambient drones. You'll also find processed vocal, and slow-motion piano that is really enjoyable to listen to. I hope that the recording conveys more than I intended.",
