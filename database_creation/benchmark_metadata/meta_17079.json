        "The SM6TRIXL flexible 11” tripod mount with universal holder fits midsize (7”-8” screen size) tablets, including iPad mini, Galaxy Note 8.0, Tab 3 7.0, Pro 8.4, and Google Nexus 7. The holder fits smartphones up to 8” screen size, including iPhone 12 Pro Max, 12, 11 Pro, 11, XS, and X, Samsung Galaxy Note 20, 10, and 9, S21, S20, and S10, and LG G7, G6, and G5. Attach the tripod adapter and holder directly onto the tripod mount. The device is held securely in place with the spring-loaded holder. The adjustable-leg design of the Slim-Grip Ultra Holder keeps any side buttons and ports unobstructed, making it ideal for using the side-accessible buttons on the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or Note Edge. Eight support legs (4 short and long) are included for optimum fit of your device. A small digital camera can be attached directly to the tripod bolt, including the Canon EOS Rebel T5 and PowerShot, or Nikon COOLPIX and D40. Take photos or video anywhere. Bend the tripod mount’s legs to grab onto fences, poles, and trees. Or hold up the tripod to get a better shot of the action at public events."
