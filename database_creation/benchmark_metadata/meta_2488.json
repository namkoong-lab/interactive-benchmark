        "Tony Kavanagh had been Allison’s dream-come-true. They were in love within days, engaged within weeks, married and pregnant within a year. Her cup bubbled over with joy . . . but years later, that joy had been extinguished by unexpected trials.",
        "The day Allison issued her husband an ultimatum, she thought it might save him. She never expected he would actually leave. She was certain God had promised to heal; it was clear that she'd misunderstood.",
        "Now, living in the quiet mountain cabin she inherited from her single, self-reliant Great Aunt Emma, Allison must come to terms with her grief and figure out how to adapt to small town life. But when she finds a wedding dress and a collection of journals in Emma’s attic, a portrait of her aunt emerges that takes Allison completely by surprise: a portrait of a heartbroken woman surprisingly like herself.",
        "As Allison reads the incredible story of Emma’s life in the 1920s and 1930s, she is forced to ask a difficult question: Does she really surrender every piece of her life to the Lord?",

        "\"Hatcher (Where the Heart Lives series) departs from her more recent historical novels for this contemporary exploration of the conundrum faced by believers when they accept God's word but can't see it being manifested in their lives ... The mountain setting is as appealing an aspect of this upbeat, well-paced novel as Allison, Emma, and their family and friends.\"",
        "~Publishers Weekly",
        "\"Award-winning Hatcher's latest is a story of love, heartbreak, and redemption ... As Hatcher blends the past and present, Allison and Emma's lives take on new meaning as we watch them each embark on solitary journeys. Hatcher's inspirational novel dramatizes the perception that even when it seems like you're alone, you are always a part of a greater plan.\"",
        "~ Booklist/American Library Association",
        "\"Hatcher's beautifully crafted tale alternates between the past and the present. Allison and Emma are incredibly relatable characters, and readers are able to examine their own lives through the mirror of the novel's events. Filled with family and faith, the author's phrasing is exquisite and a treat to savor.\"",

        "A Promise Kept",
        "is a deeply personal story. While my charactersare never me--I allow them to be individuals and allow their lives tounfold in their own way--there are always pieces of me in them. A greatdeal of Allison and her story was inspired by my own marriage and by the God who not only answers prayers but does so in completely unexpectedways. I wrote this novel, in part, as my thanksgiving for all that Hehas done in my life.Some months before I realized this story was burning inside of me, ready to be told, Francine Rivers told me in anemail that she wanted to read a novel by me inspired by the events in my marriage. I still thought it would be \"someday\" and didn't expect it to be \"someday soon.\" After all, there were other books in the pipeline.But here, too, God had His way, opening the door so I could write it and giving me the ideas needed so I could begin.When the book was finished, I sent it to Francine. After all, she'd said she wanted to read it. Here is what she wrote back:",

        "~ Francine Rivers, New York Times' best selling authorI am always nervous when I send a book out into the world, so you canimagine my delight over Francine's enjoyment and endorsement of thebook. I care very deeply about Allison, Tony, Emma, and the othercharacters who people this novel. I hope you'll feel the same way whenyou read it. Even more, I hope the story will open your eyes to the many unexpected ways God is answering your prayers and keeping His promises.Robin Lee Hatcher",

        "Award-winning Hatcher’s (Belonging, 2011) latest is a story of love, heartbreak, and redemption. If Allison Kavanagh had her way, she would be happily married and living close to her family. Instead, after inheriting her great-aunt’s mountain cabin, she resides there with only her little dog for company. Initially, Allison is consumed by her loneliness and regrets. Soon, though, she begins to make a new life for herself with fulfilling work, close friends, and meaningful hobbies. Eventually one of her favorite activities becomes immersing herself in her great-aunt Emma’s old journals, where she discovers a strong woman who faced trials similar to her own. Emma used her faith to carry her through her struggles, and Allison gradually allows herself to do the same. As Hatcher blends the past and present, Allison and Emma’s lives take on new meaning as we watch them each embark on solitary journeys. Hatcher’s inspirational novel dramatizes the perception that even when it seems like you’re alone, you are always part of a greater plan. --Carolyn Richard",
