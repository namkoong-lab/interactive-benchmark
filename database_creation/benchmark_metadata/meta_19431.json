        "The legendary mind-clouding man of mystery is back in this film noir tale set in New Orleans, where nothing is ever as it seems. Exiled Spanish leader Pablo Ramirez is hiding out on Bourbon Street as plans are laid to overthrow the oppressive dictatorship that currently exists in his country. A fascist generalissimo has planted assassins in the city to dispose of Ramirez and thwart his impending coup d'etat. Lamont Cranston (Richard Derr) -- aka the Shadow -- is summoned to protect Ramirez and thus ensure a successful revolution. The Shadow, summons up his supernatural powers of hypnosis and invisibility to save Ramirez and stop his enemies' diabolical exploits."
