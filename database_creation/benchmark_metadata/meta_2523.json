        "About the Author",
        "Born and raised in Queens, New York, Sam Barone graduated from Manhattan College with a BS degree. After a hitch in the Marine Corps, he entered the world of technology. In 1999, after thirty years developing software in management, Sam retired from Western Union International, as VP of International Systems. He moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, to take up his second career as a writer. Seven years later, the author’s first Eskkar story, Dawn of Empire, was published in the USA and UK. It has since been released worldwide.   History and reading have always been two of Sam’s favorite interests, and considers himself more of a storyteller than a writer. “I write stories that I would enjoy reading, and it’s a true blessing that others have found these tales interesting, informative, and entertaining.” Sam and his wife Linda, and their two cats (Minga and Norton) have recently moved and enjoy a quieter life in Prescott Arizona. His books have been published in nine languages, and he receives correspondence from all over the world. Sam enjoys hearing from his readers, and invites them to visit www.sambarone.com.",
