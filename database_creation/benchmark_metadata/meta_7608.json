        "It is a priceless power-packed tool that will shift your life on so many levels: clarity, success, enlightenment and inner healing, just to name a few. Most definitely it will guide you in discovering your life's passions and equip you to follow through in getting them accomplished. My co-authors and I have made YOU the center of attention by pouring wisdom and knowledge into every page throughout this book. I have personally asked these amazing men and women to search beyond themselves to find the inspiration that collaboratively combines years of coaching and counselling sessions, not just for a methodical approach to solving life's issues, but to form an actual connection with you, our dear reader, to show you that there are no limitations to what the mind can conceive, and for that matter, achieve."

        "It was such an honor to be part of this compelling anthology! The dream team of 30 Mentors from across the globe really put together a comprehensive life changing book full of insights from all ages, all points of view and with a nugget for all of us at different stages of life. This is a book you can refer to time and time again, as the obstacles and opportunities of life unfold.Teresa Maron, December 2013Co-author, Living Without Limitations, 30 Mentors to Rock your World!",
        "From the Author",
        "My vision for this Compilation was that of having a cohesive group of co-authors who would deliver a specific topic that was based on Life Coaching or Mentoring with all the things that are relevant to an individual's life cycle. Each chapter was focused and in alignment with areas of importance to all people, both men and women, regardless of what role or profession they are in. The themes of each chapter follows through right to the end with the reader being the focus of each sentence. The intensity and sync of each chapter is phenomenal, more than I hoped for, yet exactly what I expected based on the amount of time and energy that I spent working with each individual co-author. It is the Masterpiece I wanted it to be and the stepping stone for my series \"Living Without Limitations\" Every reader will be equipped to break through any liming beliefs and fears that may be blocking success in any area of their lives. My Ultimate goal was that the reader would  have a life-shifting perspective if not once but 30 times over throughout this book. Afterall, it was written for them. Anita Sechesky, Author & Compiler of \"Living Without Limitations - 30 Mentors to Rock Your World\""
