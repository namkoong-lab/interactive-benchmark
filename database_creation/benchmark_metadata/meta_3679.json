        "Metallic Spandex also known as \"Foil\" has a 4-way Stretch capability with a shiny reflective front. Stretch fabrics are split into two categories: 2-way stretch and 4-way stretch. 2-way stretch fabrics stretch in one direction, usually from selvedge to selvedge (but can be in other directions depending on the knit). 4-way stretch fabrics, such as spandex, stretches in both directions, crosswise and lengthwise Stretch fabrics simplify the construction of clothing. First used in swimsuits and women's bras, fashion designers began using them as early as the mid-1980s. They entered the mainstream market in the early 1990s, and are widely used in sports clothing.
