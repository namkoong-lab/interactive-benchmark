        "The definitive collection of the best in science fiction stories between 1929 and 1964The book you now hold contains twenty-six of the greatest science fiction stories ever written. They represent the considered verdict of the Science Fiction Writers of America, those who have shaped the genre and who know, more intimately than anyone else, what the criteria for excellence in the field should be. The authors chosen for The Science Fiction of Hall Fame are the men and women who have shaped the body and heart of modern science fiction; their brilliantly imaginative creations continue to inspire and astound new generations of writers and fans.Robert Heinlein in \"The Roads Must Roll\" describes an industrial civilization of the future caught up in the deadly flaws of its own complexity. \"Country of the Kind,\" by Damon Knight, is a frightening portrayal of biological mutation. \"Nightfall,\" by Isaac Asimov, one of the greatest stories in the science fiction field, imagines a planet where the sun sets only once every millennium and is a chilling study in mass psychology.Originally published in 1970 to honor those writers and their stories that had come before the institution of the Nebula Awards,",

        "If you own only one anthology of classic science fiction, it should be",
        "The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964",
        ". Selected by a vote of the membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), these 26 reprints represent the best, most important, and most influential stories and authors in the field. The contributors are a Who's Who of classic SF, with every Golden Age giant included: Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny. Other contributors are less well known outside the core SF readership. Three of the contributors are famous for one story--but what stories!--Tom Godwin's pivotal hard-SF tale, \"The Cold Equations\"; Jerome Bixby's \"It's a",
        "Good",
        "Life\" (made only more infamous by the chilling",
        "Twilight Zone",
        "adaptation); and Daniel Keyes's \"Flowers for Algernon\" (brought to mainstream fame by the movie adaptation,",
        "Charly",
        ").",
        "The collection has some minor but frustrating flaws. There are no contributor biographies, which is bad enough when the author is a giant; but it's especially sad for contributors who have become unjustly obscure. Each story's original publication date is in small print at the bottom of the first page. And neither this fine print nor the copyright page identifies the magazines in which the stories first appeared.",
        "Prefaced by editor Robert Silverberg's introduction, which describes SFWA and details the selection process,",
        "The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964",
        "is a wonderful book for the budding SF fan. Experienced SF readers should compare the table of contents to their library before making a purchase decision. Fans who contemplate giving this book to non-SF readers should bear in mind that, while several of the collected stories can measure up to classic mainstream literary stories, the less literarily-acceptable stories are weighted toward the front of the collection; adult mainstream-literature fans may not get very far into",
