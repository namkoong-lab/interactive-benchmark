        "Jaw length 10 mm, total length 110 mm, Cutting capacity range 0.30 mm to 1.25 mm. Near flat cut on one end of wire* * PLEASE NOTE: Lindstrom cutters are NOT guaranteed. Cutting limits printed on the handles are for soft copper wire only. Metal alloys commonly used for jewelry are much harder. All types of Flush cutters are very delicate. If damage occurs to the tips we recommend that you grind the undamaged side down to match the damaged side and continue to use the cutters. Dents in the cutting surface are a clear indication that the hardness of the metal being cut is in excess of the limits of the cutters. Lindstrom, and other brands of cutters, as they are commonly used in the jewelry industry should be considered consumable labor saving devices. This cutter has a good combination of strength and flushness. This is the most popular Lindstrom Side Cutter made. Lindstrom 80-Series Cutters offers unsurpassed cutting capacity covering a wide range of applications."
