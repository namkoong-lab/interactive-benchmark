        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreS-K—In this worthy sequel to the Caldecott-winning A Sick Day for Amos McGee, the Steads return to the world of kindly, elderly, and gangly Amos McGee, incorporating elements of the first story that readers loved. All the zoo friends are back, and Amos rides the big, blue number five bus to and from work. However, this time, Amos's predictable, quiet life is altered not by a cold but by a lack of sleep. Amos's excitement over planning an outing for his zoo friends prevents him from getting a good night's sleep, causing him to snooze at the breakfast table and miss his bus. When he finally arrives at the zoo, poor Amos cannot stay awake, so while he sleeps, the concerned animals take care of him in a variety of ways, resulting in the friends being able to take Amos's planned trip. The woodblock artwork is just as gorgeous as in the original, and the illustrator seems to have fun expanding slightly on Amos's world, showing his new bedside table, his wingback chair, and a mysterious giraffe that rides the number five bus. Until the friends are on their way to the beach, Amos looks a bit less content than in the first book. Luckily, his smile returns. VERDICT In a world of sickness, strife, and stridency, it is a pleasure to spend time again with Amos McGee and his zoo friends.—Sally James, South Hillsborough Elem. Sch., CA",
