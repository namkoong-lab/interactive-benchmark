The intention of the book is to help Afghans and non-Afghan learn to cook delicious Afghan food in easy to follow steps. The book is written from the Western perspective and directions are provided to easily locate the needed ingredients and short cuts included for the person that is on the go. This book is the result of many years of collecting, research, observation, and practice in regards to cooking Afghan cuisine.

A portion of the proceeds of this book will be donated to the women and children living in Afghanistan."
