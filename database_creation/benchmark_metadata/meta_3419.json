        "This is a sterling silver charm that has been oxidized (darkened). Please recheck the measurement size of the charm as some charms can be smaller or larger than expected. This charm does not fit European style bead bracelets or necklaces. The color of the charm in the picture may vary depending on your monitor. When cleaning and caring for your gold and silver jewelry, remember that if handled with care, it can last a lifetime without breakage or tarnishing. Many people don't know this, but gold/silver's worst enemy is chlorine, which is found in pools or hot tubs. Stay away from harsh household chemicals such as ammonia, chlorine, etc, as they can weaken your gold/silver jewelry and damage its finish. Gold/silver can lose its luster over time if repeatedly exposed to moisture, perspiration, body chemicals or makeup. Make sure to clean your jewelry regularly to remove these substances. You can use a cleaning solution of lukewarm water and a mild soap. After cleaning and rinsing, always dry and polish jewelry with a chamois or soft cloth to avoid scratches and to bring out its shine. Also, proper storage is very important. Always store your jewelry in a jewelry box, as this will prevent from breakage or tangling. Please inquire previous to purchase for large quantity orders."
