        "\"Great work—This might be what Mark Twain would sound like if he wrote crime.\"--Jeffrey Siger, New York Times acclaimed author of the Chief Inspector Andreas Kaldis Mysteries Makro, the world's largest ride-hail service, has a human resources problem. A gunman is methodically murdering their drivers in Chicago.Det. Mark Bergman is dealing with core competency and personal fulfillment issues: His recently acquired celebrity status as the city's most lethal cop is messing with his work, and his recently acquired love life is a transatlantic disaster.Meanwhile, the American Gun Association is having no problems at all. They're funding a flashy multimedia campaign to eliminate Illinois' handgun permit restrictions, and it's working perfectly.Then there's the racist militia, a paranoid snitch, a tense fundraiser at the Lyric Opera and Liechtenstein's banking regulations.\"Another bulls-eye for Lenny Kleinfeld. He targets celebrity culture and the gun lobby with a lethal weapon: his wit. Shooting Lessons is so good, so mordant, so wildly imaginative that you don’t want these cops to get their man a moment too soon.\"—Jacki Lyden, author of the international bestseller, Daughter Of The Queen Of Sheba"
