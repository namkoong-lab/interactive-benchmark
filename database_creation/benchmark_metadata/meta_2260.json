        "In the rivalry that began with The Boys Start the War (1992), the Hatford boys once again square off against their neighbors, the Malloy sisters, when both agree that the winner of the school Halloween costume contest can exact a month's ``slavery'' from the losers. After fruitless attempts to winkle out each other's ideas, both sides resort to sabotage, which gets them disqualified. As in the first book, the Hatfords and Malloys are evenly matched and their pranks generally backfire, causing fury or embarrassment but no harm. Naylor's young characters are lively and distinct (adults are seldom seen, existing only to avoid or manipulate), but the ``war,'' again, seems forced. Generally, the combatants want to call it off, but each time it's about to flicker out, some contrived circumstance heats it up. The plot is episodic, with an extraneous subplot--Caroline makes a long-awaited stage debut in a fourth-grade production--and no single climax. The versatile Naylor seems to be treading water with this aimless series. (Fiction. 11- 13) --",

Although large-print editions are targeted to the visually-impaired or dyslexic child, they can also be used by standard-vision readers.

That's important when you're a kid and you can only read Large Print, you want your book to look like all the other books. I'm reading a lot more now that we have found Thorndike Press.\" -- Jim Bernardin, Islamorada, FL\"Everyone loves to read, there's nothing like curling up with a good book. We're a reading family, so when our son was diagnosed with Stargardt's Disease and only able to read Large Print, it was particularly difficult. Books on tape are wonderful but they don't fill the void of actually reading a good story. Large Print books have been around a long time for older people, but to find a good novel for a young person in Large Print began to feel nearly impossible. The books that Thorndike Press publishes have truly made a difference in my son's reading life. He can enjoy current novels as well as some of the classics that he missed reading when it became too difficult with regular print.\" -- Sara Bernardin, Islamorada, FL\"Naylor captures the way kids play . . .\" --",

Telling stories, anyway, if not writing them down. I had my first short story published when I was sixteen, and wrote stories to help put myself through college, planning to become a clinical psychologist. By the time I graduated with a BA degree, however, I decided that writing was really my first love, so I gave up plans for graduate school and began writing full time.\", \"I'm not happy unless I spend some time writing every day. It's as though pressure builds up inside me, and writing even a little helps to release it. On a hard-writing day, I write about six hours. Tending to other writing business, answering mail, and just thinking about a book takes another four hours. I spend from three months to a year on a children's book, depending on how well I know the characters before I begin and how much research I need to do. A novel for adults, because it's longer, takes a year or more. When my work is going well, I wake early in the mornings, hoping it's time to get up. When the writing is hard and the words are flat, I'm not very pleasant to be around.\", \"Getting an idea for a book is the easy part. Keeping other ideas away while I'm working on one story is what's difficult. My books are based on things that have happened to me, things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings. The best part about writing is the moment a character comes alive on paper, or when a place that existed only in my head becomes real. There are no bands playing at this moment, no audience applauding--a very solitary time, actually--but it's what I like most. I've now had more than 120 books published, and about 2000 short stories, articles and poems.\", \"I live in Bethesda, Maryland, with my husband, Rex, a speech pathologist, who's the first person to read my manuscripts when they're finished. Our sons, Jeff and Michael, are grown now, but along with their wives and children, we often enjoy vacations together in the mountains or at the ocean. When I'm not writing, I like to hike, swim, play the piano and attend the theater.\", \"I'm lucky to have my family, because they have contributed a great deal to my books. But I'm also lucky to have the troop of noisy, chattering characters who travel with me inside my head. As long as they are poking, prodding, demanding a place in a book, I have things to do and stories to tell.\"]}"
