CMS brand, CMS is one of the most trusted names in the Computer Memory industry and this product carries a Lifetime Warranty from CMS. IF YOU NEED ECC REG SINGLE RANK PLEASE EMAIL US Features Compatible with Dell Precision Workstation 670 This chipset supports a maximum of 8 ranks. Per Dell, Dual Rank modules are only supported in the first two banks, sockets DIMM_1 through DIMM_4. Sockets DIMM_5 and DIMM_6 do not support Dual Rank modules. If Dual Rank modules are installed in sockets DIMM_3 and DIMM_4, sockets DIMM_5 and DIMM_6 are disabled. If 4GB is installed, the recognized memory may be reduced to 3.5GB or less (depending on system configuration and memory allocation). A 64-bit operating system is required to utilize more than 4GB of memory. If you install more than 4GB of memory, Dell requires an additional cooling fan. Kingston supports Chipkill (SDDC) technology on this system with our 1GB, 2GB, and 4GB modules only. Our 512MB module is not Chipkill (SDDC) compatible."
