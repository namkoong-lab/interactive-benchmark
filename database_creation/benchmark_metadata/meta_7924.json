        "A land of legend and lore, Ireland is also home to some of the most breathtaking residences in the world, 10 of which are explored in this charming book. Take a once-in-a-lifetime tour through these historical homes and castles—all still owned and lived in by the original families—furnished with heirlooms and cherished hand-me-downs. From cabinets filled with monogrammed china to cabbage-rose slipcovered sofas nestled beneath tall Gothic windows, the lavish living rooms and bedrooms, print-lined hallways, and well-used mudrooms capture the distinctive personalities of their owners.",
