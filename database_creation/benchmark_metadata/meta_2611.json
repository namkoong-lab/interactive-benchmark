        "Being Martian isn’t easy. Many are hopeless dreamers—and most are drunks.Martians are pale, red-eyed humanoids; physically gifted, scientifically advanced, but culturally-backward. We built casinos on Mars, and view Martians with the same lack of regard displayed toward Native Americans.One Martian defied his racial stigma to rise to the position of homicide detective. His name is Bobby Haller, and he has problems galore. A local gangster is breathing down his neck. His fellow Martians are planning a revolt. He’s dodging bullets on a daily basis. Staying alive in Los Angeles is part tightrope walk, part Martian Shuffle.Scrambling to prevent a war between the planets, Bobby and his bad-ass counterpart Samuel Barone still hope to discover the best of life on Earth–family, friendship, redemption.It could already be too late. Martians are planning a comeback—and the end of life on Earth as we know it."
