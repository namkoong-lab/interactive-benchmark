        "Bossman’s Beard Oil for Men strengthens + softens hair, relieves itching + irritation, and has a great long-lasting scent. Our mens beard oil scented is exactly what you need to keep your beard looking, feeling, and smelling fresh all day long no matter how active or grueling the lifestyle. We stand behind our beard products because they’re made by humans with beards, tested by humans with beards, and are for other humans with beards. If you are experiencing flaking or a dry face, otherwise called “Beardruff”, after your first use, Bossman beard oil natural will immediately eliminate this issue and it will never come back. See directions below for use in the 4 Stage Beard Care Process: DIRECTIONS: 1. In the shower, use a natural soap (Bossman’s 4-1 Exfoliating Bar Soap). This soap is free of foaming agents that dry out your face and create “Beardruff”, at the same time it moisturizes the pores and beard so you are ready for your next step. 2. After you have washed your beard with Bossman’s 4-1 Exfoliating Bar Soap apply Bossman’s Fortify Intense Conditioner. Wait a few minutes then wash out. This amazing product will replenish and rehydrate your beard from daily activities such as wind, sun, and any dirty job your beard faces. 3. Immediately after the shower, apply Bossman’s Original BEARD OIL. This is the perfect time to apply as most of us take a warm shower creating your pores to become open and ready to accept an oil application. Once the oil reached into your pore, this lubrication is eliminate and dryness in your face and eliminate flaking. 4. Using your finger or the back of your thumb, get about a dime-size amount of Bossman’s Relaxing Beard Balm, warm in up into your palms, and apply it to your beard and mustache thoroughly. You may use your fingers to apply, but for best results use any Bossman comb or brush to get the products down into your pores and completely from root to tip of your beard hair."
