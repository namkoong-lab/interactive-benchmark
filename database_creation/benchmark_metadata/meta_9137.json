I'm the author of 20 cookbooks including the James Beard Award nominated Perfect Party Food. There are quite a few e-books on Amazon that I DID NOT WRITE, I ask that you go to my website and check out my books there. I travel and teach cooking classes all over the country, spending 1/2 the year in a small hill town in Italy, teaching in the Dordogne region of France and at Rancho La Puerta in Mexico. Teaching is my passion and I love being able to do something that I love that includes meeting my readers and students all over the country. Check out my website www.dianephillips.com for my class schedule and tours for 2019 to Sicily and the European Christmas markets of the Danube.
