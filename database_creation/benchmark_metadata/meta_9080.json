        "This book is about RV camping in the public campgrounds spread across the U.S. These campgrounds are managed by and located on state, city, county or federal agency park lands. Being in a public park environment, campground sites tend to be among woods, spread out, and non-commercial. Because local, state or federal tax funds provide partial support for the parks, you will find that camping fees are often less than $19 a night. In addition, agencies will frequently give discounts (some up to 50%) to campers who are disabled, military, or seniors. The individual campgrounds selected for this book will accommodate most RVs of all classes and sizes. They are reasonably convenient to an Interstate road. You will also find a list of specific campground features, phone numbers, websites and GPS coordinates. Detailed, turn-by-turn directions from the Interstate, are also included. Granted, not all camps are full service or full hook-up, but the mix of amenities, modest fees, and beautiful location make for a wonderful RVing experience. All the campgrounds have a source of potable water and restrooms. Most have showers and dump stations or sewers. Many have electricity. With very few exceptions, all are pet friendly. A novel feature of the book is the inclusion of local 'Points of Interest.' If you're traveling in an area of the country new to you, a few suggestions of things to do or see, once your rig is setup, seemed like a good idea and will definitely add to your camping enjoyment."

        "About the Author",
        "Lee Zaborowski is a retired educator, both as a classroom teacher, and later an administrator in Adult and Continuing Education programs. Lee has authored before, this is his fourth book. He has also written for and published extensively in professional science and adult education journals. Lee and Jeanne have three children and four grandchildren. Lee fell in love with the outdoors, as a youth during the 40s and 50s, during the then annual summer trips to a resort in northern Wisconsin. Since those days he's lugged canvas tents around Idaho to fly fish, and progressed to long bicycle touring/camping trips of 1,000 miles or more, all over the United States, carrying clothes, camping gear, tools, etc. in panniers on the bike. Adding up all those tent, bicycle and now RV trips would probably get you around 200,000 miles. Since retiring, Lee and his wife Jeanne, with the two family cats, are on the road regularly, touring the States in their RV. Lee is a member of four RV clubs, including being the Newsletter Publisher for one of them. In addition he does 'RV Photography' Seminars. Both Lee and Jeanne enjoy photography. All the photographs in the book were take by one or the other of them."
