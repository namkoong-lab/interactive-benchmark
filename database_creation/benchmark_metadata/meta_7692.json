        "About the Author",
        "Dr. Frank Charles Thompson",
        "was a young preacher in the late 1800s when he became disappointed with the reference Bibles being used by preachers. Dr. Thompson believed Bible study tools should be presented in a simple but scholarly way. He saw the need for a well-organized reference Bible that would be of practical use to the lay reader as well as to preachers. In 1890, Dr. Thompson began the work he would continue for the rest of his life. He completed a series of \"thought suggestions\" opposite key verses throughout the Bible. These are what became the \"chain links\" that comprise the heart of the Thompson system. Some in Dr. Thompson's church saw his Bible and told him this would be a great help to them in their Bible study too. They encouraged Dr. Thompson to have his Bible, with its extensive marginal references, published so that everyone could enjoy the blessing of this helpful study system. In 1908, the first edition of the Thompson® Chain-Reference® Bible was printed. It became known as the most helpful, comprehensive, and unbiased study Bible available. After Dr. Thompson’s passing in 1940, his work and legacy continued with several major updates and enhancements to the study system over the years. The Thompson Chain-Reference Bible’s impact has grown as it has been offered in five English Bible translations as well as multiple Spanish editions. With over 100,000 topical reference and 8,000 chain topics, this Bible continues to offer a complete study library in one volume."
