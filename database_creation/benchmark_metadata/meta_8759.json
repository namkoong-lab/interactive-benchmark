Although his training and expertise is in English language teaching (ELT) and teacher training, he's recently become known for his work on spirituality and compassion. Some of this grew out of experiences he had when walking the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route across northern Spain in 2014. Since then has been working to build pilgrim practices into his daily life and every day habits. That work has informed his writing and his favorite form falls somewhere between the essay and the devotional.\", 'In addition to his work as an author, Chuck is also founder of an initiative called EdYOUfest which reconnects what’s inseparable by bringing communities of teachers and learners, doers, makers, and creators together in beautiful settings around the world for collaborative days of idea ignition, and a founder and director of The International Teacher Development Institute iTDi) which aims to better the world by helping teachers around the world become better teachers.', \"Chuck blogs on education, motivation, leadership, spirituality, and compassion for EFL Magazine and the iTDi Blog and publishes poetry and small fictions in journals you've probably never heard of before. He's also an avid gardener and compulsive reader who reads widely and with pleasure. Connect with Chuck on Twitter where he's @chucksandy and on Facebook where he's one of the two Chuck Sandy's there and pretty recognizable.\"]}"
