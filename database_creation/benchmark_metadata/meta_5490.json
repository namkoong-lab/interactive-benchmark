        "R&L Racing Roll Up Tonneau Cover. Get effective bed protection, upgraded appearance, and even improved fuel economy, all at a budget price, with the R&L Racing Roll-Up Tonneau Cover. The vinyl cover will protect your truck bed and contents from the elements, and give your truck a smooth aerodynamic appearance that will even reduce drag for more miles per gallon. It features the quick and easy Clean-Seal closure system, lightweight aluminum rails and bows, and easy no-drill installation. Cargo in an unprotected pickup truck bed can become moisture damaged and corrode from exposure to rain and snow, and faded from the sun. Objects can blow out of the bed from high winds and the same winds can cause debris to blow in and collect in the bed. An open pickup bed creates aerodynamic drag, making the engine work harder, which takes more fuel, and by anyone’s standards a bed covered with a smart looking tonneau just looks better than a cluttered, open bed. The R&L Racing Roll-Up Tonneau Cover will provide you with the protection, mileage and style you want, at a bargain price. The R&L Racing Roll-Up is easy to install and easy to use. Installation is easy with heavy-duty clamps, so it can be installed and ready to use in very little time, with no drilling required. When installed, the low profile design of this tonneau will enhance the appearance of any truck, and it will retain its appearance even after a snowfall thanks to the aluminum support bows. When you need access to the bed, just roll the cover up to the front of the bed and secure it with the included nylon straps. The Clean-Seal tongue-in-groove closure system makes securing the tonneau to the truck bed fast and simple, without the need to fumble with snaps or zippers. The R&L Racing Roll-Up Tonneau Cover is covered by a limited 1-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty applies to the original purchaser as long as he or she owns the vehicle on which the product is installed."
