        "With dead-on comic timing, Sheri McInnis's smart, sexy novel stars one of the most exuberantly realized heroines in recent years. Trouble is, she's about to go on a date from hell. Literally.  Sally Carpenter is a struggling New York City actress. She hasn't had a real gig in two years, she hates her day job, and her agent won't return her calls. She's just about ready to pack it in when she meets someone with the power to change her life. Jack Weaver is not only one of the city's most eligible bachelors, he's the charismatic president of a major TV network. Sally's not sure she trusts him at first. She's heard rumors he's ruthless in business -- and elsewhere. Still, when he asks her out to dinner, she doesn't say no.  Almost overnight, Sally's luck turns. She lands a role on a hit TV show and Jack thinks she's the Next Big Thing. But she can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. Especially when anyone who stands in Jack's way ends up in the hospital -- or worse. Has she really met Mr. Right -- or has she fallen for the Devil himself? She's not afraid of losing her heart, but is her soul on the line, too?"
