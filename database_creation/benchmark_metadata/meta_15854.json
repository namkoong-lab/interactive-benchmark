        "Lightning X Products strives to give you the absolute most amount of product for the least amount of money. With most first responders having to fork out money from their own pockets to buy their gear, we wanted to help out. The Value Series Gear Bags were designed to give you the best value for your hard-earned dollar, without sacrificing quality. The RB40 medic rescue turnout gear bag gives you nearly all of the same features as our deluxe duffle gear bags but at substantially lower price. This bag features a top opening that allows you to step into your extrication or turnout gear, which allows for quicker response times in an emergency. The shoulder strap and handles have reflective stitching sewn right into the webbing for added visibility on scene. The front features a highly detailed embroidered star of life EMS logo, not screen printed like competitors' bags. Outside of the main compartment there are two side pockets for a change of clothes or jumpsuit. The front also features a smaller pocket for personal effects like keys, wallet, flashlight, window punch or extrication gloves. The entire bag is covered by a limited lifetime warranty from Lightning X Products. Now you can get your bag personalized! These bags comes with up to two lines of custom embroidered text where you can add a name, department, engine company or any personalized message. Makes for a wonderful gift for the first responder, EMT or rescue technician in your life! On screen fonts are computer generated and may differ slightly from the final embroidered product."
