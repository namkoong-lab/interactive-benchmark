    "description": [
        "Well, we know a lot of people prefer the traditional methods of colonizing grains, which is in quart jars. This sale is for 1 quart jar of fully hydrated and sterilized white millet with self healing injection port lid and 5 micron gas exchange filters. These jars are filled a little over 3/4 of the way with sterilized white millet which has the most inoculation points of any mushroom spawn. The jars are sterilized and ready to use right out of the box! Simply inject 2-4 ml of gourmet mushroom spore solution or liquid culture and your done! Allow to fully colonize at room temperatures for approximately 20 days. Now your colonized grains can be cased, used for grain transfers or spawned to a bulk substrate for larger grows. You may choose quantities of one jar or four jars from the drop down menu. If you need larger quantities please see our bulk discount listings. If you need to store your jar before use leave the jar in the original packaging and keep in a cool dry location. The jar can keep for over 4 months in these conditions."
