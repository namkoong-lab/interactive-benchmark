        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 8 Up-Michael Platt, the founder of Michaels Desserts and the nonprofit PLLATE, brings readers a cookbook with a mission: ending hunger. The book opens with a history of Platt and his philanthropic efforts. Platt got his start baking after an epilepsy diagnosis and, passionate about ending food insecurity in his community, started Michaels Desserts. For every order Michaels Desserts receives, the business donates an equal amount of baked goods to local shelters. Building on that success, Platt founded PLLATE, which creates snack packs for kids facing food insecurity. The extensive introduction concludes with an inspiring call to action for any kid who wants to make a difference. Platt then discusses bakeware basics before delving into the recipes, which are divided into four sections: Freedom Fighter Cupcakes, Pies & Tarts, Cakes, and Snacks & Breads. A highlight is the Freedom Fighter Cupcakes, each of which are named after someone from whom Platt draws inspiration, such as Malala Yousafzai Carrot Halwa Cupcakes. Each recipe has a full-page accompanying photo and most also include a blurb with interesting facts about the ingredients, historical context, or Platt's personal connection to the recipe. VERDICT The combination of delectable desserts and inspirational messaging makes this a must-purchase for teen cookbook collections.α(c) Copyright 2011.

        "Review",
        "“Platt offers a primer explaining necessary tools that may not be readily available in every kitchen and includes insight on recipes where extra adult help may be needed (frying beignets) or where beginners are likely to have better luck starting (jam tarts). But the real prize in this gem is Platt's narrative. He shares personal connections to recipes that have been passed down in his family and provides background on the themes of his signature Freedom Fighter Cupcakes. His own story of determination and social consciousness puts the icing on this cake.” —",

        "Hello, my name is Michael Platt. I'm a sixteen-year-old entrepreneur. And I love baking and cooking.",
        "My love affair with food started at home. Spending time with loved ones in the kitchen, with those sweet and savory smells filling the house...it's so special. My family is passionate about cooking. At our family dinners, everyone makes their specialty dish and many of the recipes have a story behind them. The stories are either about the origin of a recipe or how it was passed down through the generations. Sharing stories and sharing food just makes you feel good.",
        "With so much love for food around me, I soon fell in love with baking. The first dish I ever baked was a layered chocolate cake, the kind that comes in a box. I was nine years old. My grandma Sarah helped me, but she let me take the lead. Since I made that first cake I have never looked back. My favorite part about baking is the finishing touches. I am amazed every time I see how the icing and decorations come together, turning a cupcake into a piece of art. And then it's also about the feeling of accomplishment. You have something that starts with eggs, flour, sugar, and other ingredients and it ends up being a delicious baked treat. It's basically chemistry and I love science. Baking is really just the cooking version of science.",
