        "Artist Luis Jiménez's distinctive portrayals of the reality of life in the Southwest have catapulted him to the forefront of the competitive art world and provide a healthy dose of social commentary.",
        "Perhaps the most visible of Jiménez's work comes in the form of public sculptures that have been commissioned in many U.S. cities, including Pittsburgh, Denver, Albuquerque, Houston, New York, San Diego, and Buffalo, to name but a handful.",
        "Some of his cast of characters include lowriders, honky-tonk dancers, musicians, vaqueros, farmers, laborers--ordinary hardworking people, and animals.",
        "\"Luis Jiménez's West is full of life--a landscape of living creatures who work and dance together. . . . He is, to himself and to others, a working person pursuing his dreams in a harsh world--a social creature trying to make works that incarnate his sociability and exclude no one, from the least sophisticated to the most refined.\"--Dave Hickey"
