        "Glenn Ford, Valli, Claude Rains and Oscar Homolka scale new heights in The White Tower, an epic Alpine adventure shot in breathtaking Technicolor . Determined to fulfill the dream that killed her father, Carla Alten (Valli) assembles an expedition to scale the treacherous Swiss mountain known as the White Tower. Accompanied by a gruff local guide (Homolka), a German ex~soldier (Lloyd Bridges), an English geologist (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), a disillusioned French writer (Rains) and an American drifter (Ford), Carla begins the tortuous ascent as her team discovers their true natures on a peak that's never been conquered."
