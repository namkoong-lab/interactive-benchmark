        "Single, attractive, thirty-something Martha Costello is a brilliant, passionate defence barrister with the unwavering belief that all are innocent until proven guilty. She is about to apply to become Queen’s Counsel (a ‘QC’ or ‘Silk’), but she’s not the only one at her chambers… Clive Reader is charming, ruthless and dangerous, and knows how to play the game… only one of them will be made QC and Senior Clerk, Billy Lamb, is the man with everyone’s lives and careers in his hands. Martha’s conscience and faith in the criminal justice system are tested to breaking point as she deals with clients who are good, bad and downright evil.",
        "Series 2",
        "Martha is now a member of the Queen's Council - a QC, which means the stakes are now higher than ever. Tensions are running high in the chambers, with the still ambitious Clive Reader having to deal with his failure to become a QC, and Billy Lamb under pressure to keep the chambers afloat. As Martha finds an ambiguous ally in Caroline Warwick, a 50-something, sharp as a stiletto QC, and Clive develops a fascination for a very beautiful and principled solicitor; passion, jealousy and ambition take hold both in and out of the courtroom."
