        "Swim around with this mama shark and her baby shark(s). The cute animal art print features a mama shark and her baby sharks and is personalized with their names. The number of sharks matches the kids in your family. Each animal art print features your personalized names as a part of the art. The personalization is created as a permanent part of the image and will not look like a stamp or afterthought as it is uniquely adjusted by our designers for perfect alignment. Block Mount: Our wood block mount is a contemporary and frame-less way to have your print displayed. The image is professionally laminated and mounted to a 3/8\" thick wooden block using an acid-free adhesive to create a smooth and vivid image. Comes ready to hang and enjoy. Canvas: Published as a giclee on fine art canvas and finished in a wood frame with a natural wood grain laminate finish. Framing is done in-house using acid free archival materials. Canvas prints are coated with a UV resistant spray and like all canvas art it does not require glass. Comes ready to hang and enjoy!"
