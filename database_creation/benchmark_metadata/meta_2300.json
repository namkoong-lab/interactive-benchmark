        "Until her father died, Adela Carstairs had lived in a secure and loving home. Then happiness was shattered when her mother remarries a cruel, hard-drinking man. With her younger brother and sister, Adela is forced to flee his drunken rages and they escape to London where they seek refuge in the squalor of the back streets. Addie's desperate hope is that her childhood companions, the Mallory twins, will find and rescue them. When all three find themselves caught up in the danger and terror of revolutionary France, the twins prove invaluable. It was to be an experience which would test their friendship, and love, to the limit."

        "About the Author",
        "Claire Lorrimer began her writing career as a child. She was encouraged and influenced by her mother, Denise Robins, author and founder member of the Romantic Novelists Association. On leaving school, Lorrimer got a job on the editorial team of a woman's magazine. During the Second World War, serving as a WAAF officer, she began to write light romantic fiction for Woman's Illustrated. Her literary work later included some sixty light romantic novels. Meticulously researched, Claire Lorrimer's historical fiction is set in many different eras and often highlights the situation of women. She lives in rural Kent and still writes stories and plays for her friends and her eight grandchildren.",
