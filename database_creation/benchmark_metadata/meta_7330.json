        "From School Library Journal",
        "Grade 4-6 An excellent overview of the giant kelp that grows off the coast of California and its importance to the wildlife of the sea and the human populations on the land. If children think they've never had any contact with kelp, they need to think again the next time they brush their teeth, walk on a smooth sidewalk, drink chocolate milk, or eat salad dressing, glazed doughnuts, cottage cheese, or catsup. All of these products use alginates, the salts from algin, the sticky substance found in the cell walls of kelp. Excellent color photographs and drawings elucidate such concepts as algae reproduction as well as the ocean currents that have a direct impact on the growth of kelp. Daegling has included suggestions for interesting experiments, an explanation of scientific names, a glossary with pronunciation, and an index. Full-color and black-and-white photographs are liberally scattered throughout. Fascinating and informative. Frances E.
