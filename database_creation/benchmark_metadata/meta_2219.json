        ".\" ★★★★★ Tory L.\"Ms Stone has written a nail biter with her 'Capturing Tess'. Sleep deprivation occurred while reading Capturing Tess because it was difficult to put down as there were things happening in the storyline that I need to know what was going to happen!! From the very beginning the book takes off at a quick pace and it is enjoyable to read as it doesn't get bogged down irrelevant fillers. I don't want to ruin the storyline for anyone because it is really well written from start to finish. True to form, there is the 'Anna Stone' level of sexy heat in and amongst the plot twists, these do not disappoint. You won't be disappointed picking up 'Capturing Tess', it will be a book you will not want to put down until the very last word.\" ★★★★★ Vanessa Mace"
