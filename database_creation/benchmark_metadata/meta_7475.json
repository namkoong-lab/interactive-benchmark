        "Review",
        "The latest in the Urban Babies Wear Black series demonstrates a wry sense of humor, crisp, sophisticated graphics and a thematic approach that leaves its presumed audience of babies in the cold. In addition to wearing bibs, it appears that foodie babies \"know their way around a kitchen,\" \"browse farmers' markets\" and \"dine al fresco.\" Dion's illustrations partake of a Helen Oxenbury-style sense of irony (the baby sharing \"small plates\" is seen from behind, flinging peas at a startled mother), but the complexity of their rendering puts them far beyond the visual comprehension of an actual baby. More for smug foodie parents than real babies--but we already knew that. (2-3) --Kirkus Reviews, December 15, 2008",
