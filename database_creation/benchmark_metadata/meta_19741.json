        "Step inside the Dead Room, where something sinister guards a home’s horrifying secrets. Inspired by a 1970s urban legend, this atmospheric nerve-shredder follows two scientists (Jed Brophy and Jeffrey Thomas) and a young psychic (Laura Petersen) as they travel to the countryside to investigate mysterious occurrences at a remote farmhouse. Skepticism quickly turns to terror as the researchers’ presence unsettles a seriously angry demonic presence possessing the home. Upping the white-knuckle suspense with visceral camerawork and unsettling sound design, The Dead Room creates a sense of palpable danger lurking in every corner and hallway"
