        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 7 Up—Sophia is a math prodigy who has a hard time connecting with people; as a result, she has one best friend. They do everything together, but stay mostly within Sophia's comfort zone as she tends to panic otherwise. Josh, a magician, believes that Sophia is the girl for him. He initiates a conversation with her to test out this theory. When she begins to finally notice him, he attempts to impress her with his magic skills, but her responses aren't what he imagined. Sophia thinks that she's a freak because of her photographic memory, intelligence, inability to express emotions, and poor social skills. But this novel isn't about saving her; it's about her coming to terms with herself and moving forward despite her fears. Although the book has a dual-perspective story line, it is skewed two-thirds toward Sophia's point of view. This Australian import has a few terms that some American readers might find difficult, but it's not too hard to decipher from the context. There is some mild swearing. Neuroatypical characters, nerdiness, social anxiety, intelligence, and magic make this book stand out among other contemporary romances. VERDICT A general purchase for most middle school collections.—Jennifer Rummel, Cragin Library, Colchester, CT",
        "Review",
        "\"The story intricately explores the teenagers' quirky relationships and the notion of what it takes to feel comfortable in one's own skin. Sophia's character is authentically geeky, and readers will empathize with her anxiety.\"",

        "\"Excellent character development of the protagonists (Sophia and Elsie are 'brown girls' of South Asian descent; Joshua is white), their diverse group of friends, and their families (Elsie's brothers, especially, are a hoot) makes the romantic relationship just one among several satisfying story strands, and witty dialogue keeps pages turning.\"",
