        "After September 11, 2001 Las Vegas Police Sergeant Randy Sutton began soliciting writing from law enforcement officers-his goal being to bridge the gap between the police and those they serve, with a book that offers a broad and thoughtful look at the many facets of police life. Hundreds of active and former officers responded from all over the United States: men and women from big cities and small towns, some who had written professionally, but most for the first time. Sutton culled the selections into five categories: The Beat, Line of Duty, War Stories, Officer Down, and Ground Zero. The result is",
        "True Blue",
        ", a collection of funny, charming, exciting, haunting stories about murder investigations, missing children, bungling burglars, car chases, lonely and desperate shut-ins, routine traffic stops, officers killed in the line of duty, and the life-changing events of September 11. Here, officers reveal their emotions-fear and pride, joy and disgust, shame and love-as they recount the defining moments of their careers. In these stories, the heart and soul behind the badge shines through in unexpected ways.",

        "Sergeant Prendes arrived at the residence, three backup units close behind. He was met in the front yard by the tearful girlfriend, her mother, and her brother. The suspect, they told him, a young man in his twenties whom newspapers later described as \"an aspiring rap artist,\" had retreated inside the house. The front door had been left wide open. The officers approached cautiously, by the book. But they hadn’t even gotten halfway up the walk when the suspect, deep inside the shadows of the open doorway, opened fire with a high- powered knock- off assault rifle, striking Prendes point- blank. He reeled backward, shouting \"I’m hit!\" before he collapsed. Under the barrage of automatic weapon gunfire, the other officers were forced to take cover behind an old Volvo at the curb in order to return fire, but not before the gunman had fired three rounds, execution- style, into Sergeant Prendes’s head.",
        "The suspect, it seemed to everyone at the scene, had gone mad. He ran upstairs and continued firing down at the officers out of the windows, firing, reloading, firing and reloading: forty- two deadly rounds. The cops returned fire, sixty- three rounds, but the gunman had an advantage with his shielded position.",
        "Bystanders, screaming, scattered and tried to take cover. One officer threw himself over a prone bystander even as the bullets tore into the ground around him. No one there thought, or would let themselves believe, that Prendes was dead. Rescuing the wounded officer was foremost in their minds, more than subduing the gunman or getting out of this alive. They decided, to a man, to rush the house.",
        "TWO HOURS LATER, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, TRAUMA CENTER. I stood among almost a hundred other cops, some in uniform, others in street clothes, outside of the trauma center. We milled around numbly, sometimes shaking hands, sometimes hugging each other, all united by a feeling of disbelief and unreserved sorrow. For hours cops kept arriving to stand with one another, drinking in not just the sorrow but warming themselves through the sense of unity such tragedy brings. Now and then bursts of laughter could be heard as those who had known Henry related funny anecdotes about something he had said or done, making him alive again, if only for that moment. Sergeant Prendes was one of the few officers who were Las Vegas natives, a hometown boy who’d been the captain of his high school football team. He was a family man, married, with two teenage daughters, and very active in his church. He was an avid golfer, an outdoorsman, a Dallas Cowboy fan, a joke teller with an irrepressible sense of humor. We all knew him as a fourteen- year police veteran and a good cop. He was just thirty- seven years old.",
        "In the growing crowd I came upon one of the officers who had been at the scene. His pants were torn at the knees where he had dropped down into a kneeling shooting stance. The acrid smell of gunsmoke wafted from his shirt.",
        "\"What finally happened?\" I asked him. He told me.",
        "Every cop at the scene of this raging gun battle knew that their ballistic vests would not protect them from the power of an assault weapon, the unrelenting fusillade such a lethal weapon let loose. Each man knew that the next moment might very well be his last. But their comrade, their fellow officer, was lying on his back in plain sight, a pool of dark blood spreading across the walkway beneath him. They prepared to advance, to break cover. Then, like a scene out of an old Western movie, a plainclothes officer with the Gang Crimes unit arrived. He was armed with an assault rifle, an AR- 15. He started firing almost before he got out of his car, and he kept firing even after he was shot in the leg. The tide turned. The suspect was ballistically overpowered; the six cops on the scene advanced; and the suspect ran down the stairs and into the front yard, spraying the neighborhood with lethal rounds. But the wounded officer shot him, staggering him. Despite his wounds, the suspect stood and continued his assault. Another officer armed with a 12- gauge broke cover and calmly marched toward the gunman, firing blast after blast until he was out of ammo, then reloaded on the move, continuing his march into the sights of the gunman. Other officers were firing from their positions, and suddenly the gunman fell, his body coming to rest just a few feet from the motionless body of Sergeant Henry Prendes.",
        "The cop now standing in front of me told me he ran to his fallen friend and pulled him to safety, out of the kill zone, in case there was a second armed suspect. But there was no other gunman and Prendes was already dead.",
        "It was over as suddenly as it began. Pungent gunsmoke filled the air. Nothing but absolute silence until one of the bystanders started whimpering and one of the cops shouted, \"Is anyone else hit?\" Then, of course, a chorus of approaching sirens.",
        "The cop stopped the story there and looked away, shrugged. I didn’t know what to say. One of the bosses came out of the trauma center to let us know that the wounded officer, the Gang Crimes Bureau officer, was going to be okay. There was scattered applause at this, some good news in a bleak day. I turned to my companion, but he was already headed back to his patrol car, his gait unnaturally stiff. I called after him but he didn’t turn around.",
        "I was scheduled to work the graveyard shift that night. I arrived early at my area command to find most of the cops in my shift already there, glued to the TV in the briefing room, where news coverage of the shoot- out continued unabated. Sergeant Prendes was the first cop in our department murdered in the line of duty in nearly two decades, which was just a few years less than most of these young officers had been alive. This was their first experience with the shooting death of a fellow officer, and the tension, an almost physical entity, enveloped me as I walked through the door. Some of the younger cops muttered oaths each time a reference was made to the killer or his \"aspirations.\" But it was the older cops who caught my attention. They simply stood or sat, their posture rigid, their eyes downcast whenever mention was made of Sergeant Prendes. The young ones felt the anger; the older ones felt the sense of loss.",
        "The undersheriff stood with our captain at the front of the briefing room. Though each had experienced this type of tragedy before, the strain was evident on their somber faces. I thought, for the first time, that the undersheriff looked older than his years. The two did their best to calm the young ones, to bring a sense of normalcy to the briefing, but when the cops filed out to their patrol cars, they were seething with an anger and a grief they couldn’t put words to. My friend from the diner and I had once tried to dissect this feeling and had decided, one long eve ning over a lot of beers, that a change happens in cops when one of their own is killed. It is a grief without a name or a border, a pervasive sadness that sinks into your soul so deep it can never be exorcised.",
        "I could only watch, share their grief without ac knowledgment, and hope that one day each would be able to come to terms in his or her own way. For I have learned as a cop that no one can really share his pain with others; at best, we can just experience the same thing silently, side by side.",
        "I buckled my worn and creaking leather holster and headed into the parking lot. But before I stepped into my supervisor’s wagon, I stopped and looked around and, just to be sure, I yanked my .45 out of the holster, slipped the magazine out, and drew the slide back, making sure I had a round chambered before I seated the magazine and reholstered.",
        "\"Just relax,\" I told myself. But it wasn’t going to be easy, not to night. I knew that no cop could be ready when up against someone who really wanted to kill us. This is where we differ from the military. We have to switch from being Officer Friendly to Rambo in about an eighth of a second. We have to go from smiling to pulling the trigger in less than two seconds. We have to be lucky or have some weird sixth sense guiding us into the most banal- to- deadly situations imaginable. Even though I’ve lived the life of a cop for almost thirty years, I felt the adrenaline begin to pump as I began my patrol.",
        "Somewhere around two a.m. I walked back to my car after conferring with an officer and a witness to a minor burglary and I saw the clouds part. There was one bright, even radiant, star blazing away through the gash in the cloud cover. I leaned against the open door of my black and white, gazing at its brilliance. \"Here’s to you, Henry,\" I saluted him. \"I won’t forget you, my friend. None of us will.\" And that’s a promise.",
        "Six days after his gruesome death, Sergeant Henry Prendes was laid to rest.",
        "Funerals, it seems to me, are the one occasion when cops truly honor each other. All petty animosities and jealousies are forgotten. The rituals that walk alongside our deaths are vital, not only to the families of our fallen but to all who wear a badge and who share its joys and burdens. The mournful wail of the bagpipes as \"Amazing Grace\" fills the heavy air becomes our collective tears. The glint of sunlight sparkling off the bugle as taps plays causes us to blink as one, momentarily blinded by our almost illogical faith in humanity. The twenty- one guns fired in unison by the stone- faced honor guard breaks their reserve and their falling tears betray their rigid posture and stoic expression. Even those of us who do not pray, pray. We pray that our fallen fellow not be forgotten; we pray that our presence on this earth will not have been in vain.",
        "More than five thousand people joined together in the memorial ser vice for Henry Prendes, and more lined the pro cession route, proudly holding their hands over their hearts as the miles of police cars, from every corner of the nation, filed by with their overhead lights flashing in silent homage. It was during these brief and beautiful moments that our community and our cops were one. One in spirit, one in all the beliefs that mattered. So when I heard one earnest young newsman call the killing of Sergeant Prendes a senseless act, I thought to myself that he was wrong. Senseless means in vain and that’s the worst way to condemn a good man to obscurity. In the death of our brave cop we must search for sense. We must embrace the unity that his death inspired, for it is that unity that can defeat \"senselessness.\" Even the most insidious evil can be faced, battled, and overcome when the righteous stand strong and together. The killer? No one will remember his name. Obscurity is his eternal condemnation.",
        "I refuse to believe that Sergeant Henry Prendes died in vain that blustery Las Vegas day. His sacrifice stands for all that we as law enforcement officers embrace: courage, duty, and, above all, honor.",

        "It was over as suddenly as it began. Pungent gunsmoke filled the air. Nothing but absolute silence until one of the bystanders started whimpering and one of the cops shouted, \"Is anyone else hit?\" Then, of course, a chorus of approaching sirens.",
        "The cop stopped the story there and looked away, shrugged. I didn’t know what to say. One of the bosses came out of the trauma center to let us know that the wounded officer, the Gang Crimes Bureau officer, was going to be okay. There was scattered applause at this, some good news in a bleak day. I turned to my companion, but he was already headed back to his patrol car, his gait unnaturally stiff. I called after him but he didn’t turn around.",
        "I was scheduled to work the graveyard shift that night. I arrived early at my area command to find most of the cops in my shift already there, glued to the TV in the briefing room, where news coverage of the shoot- out continued unabated. Sergeant Prendes was the first cop in our department murdered in the line of duty in nearly two decades, which was just a few years less than most of these young officers had been alive. This was their first experience with the shooting death of a fellow officer, and the tension, an almost physical entity, enveloped me as I walked through the door. Some of the younger cops muttered oaths each time a reference was made to the killer or his \"aspirations.\" But it was the older cops who caught my attention. They simply stood or sat, their posture rigid, their eyes downcast whenever mention was made of Sergeant Prendes. The young ones felt the anger; the older ones felt the sense of loss.",
        "The undersheriff stood with our captain at the front of the briefing room. Though each had experienced this type of tragedy before, the strain was evident on their somber faces. I thought, for the first time, that the undersheriff looked older than his years. The two did their best to calm the young ones, to bring a sense of normalcy to the briefing, but when the cops filed out to their patrol cars, they were seething with an anger and a grief they couldn’t put words to. My friend from the diner and I had once tried to dissect this feeling and had decided, one long eve ning over a lot of beers, that a change happens in cops when one of their own is killed. It is a grief without a name or a border, a pervasive sadness that sinks into your soul so deep it can never be exorcised.",
        "I could only watch, share their grief without ac knowledgment, and hope that one day each would be able to come to terms in his or her own way. For I have learned as a cop that no one can really share his pain with others; at best, we can just experience the same thing silently, side by side.",
        "I buckled my worn and creaking leather holster and headed into the parking lot. But before I stepped into my supervisor’s wagon, I stopped and looked around and, just to be sure, I yanked my .45 out of the holster, slipped the magazine out, and drew the slide back, making sure I had a round chambered before I seated the magazine and reholstered.",
        "\"Just relax,\" I told myself. But it wasn’t going to be easy, not to night. I knew that no cop could be ready when up against someone who really wanted to kill us. This is where we differ from the military. We have to switch from being Officer Friendly to Rambo in about an eighth of a second. We have to go from smiling to pulling the trigger in less than two seconds. We have to be lucky or have some weird sixth sense guiding us into the most banal- to- deadly situations imaginable. Even though I’ve lived the life of a cop for almost thirty years, I felt the adrenaline begin to pump as I began my patrol.",
        "Somewhere around two a.m. I walked back to my car after conferring with an officer and a witness to a minor burglary and I saw the clouds part. There was one bright, even radiant, star blazing away through the gash in the cloud cover. I leaned against the open door of my black and white, gazing at its brilliance. \"Here’s to you, Henry,\" I saluted him. \"I won’t forget you, my friend. None of us will.\" And that’s a promise.",
        "Six days after his gruesome death, Sergeant Henry Prendes was laid to rest.",
        "Funerals, it seems to me, are the one occasion when cops truly honor each other. All petty animosities and jealousies are forgotten. The rituals that walk alongside our deaths are vital, not only to the families of our fallen but to all who wear a badge and who share its joys and burdens. The mournful wail of the bagpipes as \"Amazing Grace\" fills the heavy air becomes our collective tears. The glint of sunlight sparkling off the bugle as taps plays causes us to blink as one, momentarily blinded by our almost illogical faith in humanity. The twenty- one guns fired in unison by the stone- faced honor guard breaks their reserve and their falling tears betray their rigid posture and stoic expression. Even those of us who do not pray, pray. We pray that our fallen fellow not be forgotten; we pray that our presence on this earth will not have been in vain.",
        "More than five thousand people joined together in the memorial ser vice for Henry Prendes, and more lined the pro cession route, proudly holding their hands over their hearts as the miles of police cars, from every corner of the nation, filed by with their overhead lights flashing in silent homage. It was during these brief and beautiful moments that our community and our cops were one. One in spirit, one in all the beliefs that mattered. So when I heard one earnest young newsman call the killing of Sergeant Prendes a senseless act, I thought to myself that he was wrong. Senseless means in vain and that’s the worst way to condemn a good man to obscurity. In the death of our brave cop we must search for sense. We must embrace the unity that his death inspired, for it is that unity that can defeat \"senselessness.\" Even the most insidious evil can be faced, battled, and overcome when the righteous stand strong and together. The killer? No one will remember his name. Obscurity is his eternal condemnation.",
        "I refuse to believe that Sergeant Henry Prendes died in vain that blustery Las Vegas day. His sacrifice stands for all that we as law enforcement officers embrace: courage, duty, and, above all, honor.",

        "(sobbing and screaming): Oh! He just broke",
        "my car window—",
        "911 operator: Are you injured?",
        "GIRLFRIEND: Come quick! He’s got a gun!",
        "Sergeant Prendes arrived at the residence, three backup units close behind. He was met in the front yard by the tearful girlfriend, her mother, and her brother. The suspect, they told him, a young man in his twenties whom newspapers later described as \"an aspiring rap artist,\" had retreated inside the house. The front door had been left wide open. The officers approached cautiously, by the book. But they hadn’t even gotten halfway up the walk when the suspect, deep inside the shadows of the open doorway, opened fire with a high- powered knock- off assault rifle, striking Prendes point- blank. He reeled backward, shouting \"I’m hit!\" before he collapsed. Under the barrage of automatic weapon gunfire, the other officers were forced to take cover behind an old Volvo at the curb in order to return fire, but not before the gunman had fired three rounds, execution- style, into Sergeant Prendes’s head.",
        "The suspect, it seemed to everyone at the scene, had gone mad. He ran upstairs and continued firing down at the officers out of the windows, firing, reloading, firing and reloading: forty- two deadly rounds. The cops returned fire, sixty- three rounds, but the gunman had an advantage with his shielded position.",
        "Bystanders, screaming, scattered and tried to take cover. One officer threw himself over a prone bystander even as the bullets tore into the ground around him. No one there thought, or would let themselves believe, that Prendes was dead. Rescuing the wounded officer was foremost in their minds, more than subduing the gunman or getting out of this alive. They decided, to a man, to rush the house.",
        "TWO HOURS LATER, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, TRAUMA CENTER. I stood among almost a hundred other cops, some in uniform, others in street clothes, outside of the trauma center. We milled around numbly, sometimes shaking hands, sometimes hugging each other, all united by a feeling of disbelief and unreserved sorrow. For hours cops kept arriving to stand with one another, drinking in not just the sorrow but warming themselves through the sense of unity such tragedy brings. Now and then bursts of laughter could be heard as those who had known Henry related funny anecdotes about something he had said or done, making him alive again, if only for that moment. Sergeant Prendes was one of the few officers who were Las Vegas natives, a hometown boy who’d been the captain of his high school football team. He was a family man, married, with two teenage daughters, and very active in his church. He was an avid golfer, an outdoorsman, a Dallas Cowboy fan, a joke teller with an irrepressible sense of humor. We all knew him as a fourteen- year police veteran and a good cop. He was just thirty- seven years old.",
        "In the growing crowd I came upon one of the officers who had been at the scene. His pants were torn at the knees where he had dropped down into a kneeling shooting stance. The acrid smell of gunsmoke wafted from his shirt.",
        "\"What finally happened?\" I asked him. He told me.",
        "Every cop at the scene of this raging gun battle knew that their ballistic vests would not protect them from the power of an assault weapon, the unrelenting fusillade such a lethal weapon let loose. Each man knew that the next moment might very well be his last. But their comrade, their fellow officer, was lying on his back in plain sight, a pool of dark blood spreading across the walkway beneath him. They prepared to advance, to break cover. Then, like a scene out of an old Western movie, a plainclothes officer with the Gang Crimes unit arrived. He was armed with an assault rifle, an AR- 15. He started firing almost before he got out of his car, and he kept firing even after he was shot in the leg. The tide turned. The suspect was ballistically overpowered; the six cops on the scene advanced; and the suspect ran down the stairs and into the front yard, spraying the neighborhood with lethal rounds. But the wounded officer shot him, staggering him. Despite his wounds, the suspect stood and continued his assault. Another officer armed with a 12- gauge broke cover and calmly marched toward the gunman, firing blast after blast until he was out of ammo, then reloaded on the move, continuing his march into the sights of the gunman. Other officers were firing from their positions, and suddenly the gunman fell, his body coming to rest just a few feet from the motionless body of Sergeant Henry Prendes.",
