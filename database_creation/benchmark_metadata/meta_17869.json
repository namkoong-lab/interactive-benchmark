        "The Manu Pro Red, Blue or Yellow boomerangs are all advanced molded designs by 3 time world champion Manuel Schuetz. Holder of 4 world records and known for his leading edge boomerang designs, Mr. Schuetz is one of the great boomerang craftsmen and athletes of all time. The current world record holder in the fast catch event with 5 throws under 15 seconds. The current world record holder in trick catch and in distance with a returning boomerang throw of over 238 meters. The Manu Pro series boomerangs are some of his latest creations for Aussie Round event throwers, for a 40-50 yard throw with accuracy. We recommend that beginners start with the yellow or the blue as they are an easier throw for average arms. Athletic adults might want to try the Red, which is heavier and includes a stiffer material mix. The Red is great for someone thinking of actually competing in an Aussie Round event. These boomerangs are one of the best for conventional boomerang throwing in the world. The Yellow and Blue are great starter boomerangs for beginning throwers and the Red is a solid boomerang for your bag for competitors.Â NOTE: This is ONE right handedÂ  boomerang. Select either Red, Blue or Yellow. For more information on Manuel Schuetz see our Boomerang News section. Manu is one of the truly great boomerang athletes of all time and his scientific approach to the sport personifies what it takes to achieve at the top levels of our fascinating sport. Throwing boomerangs well is a science, involving much more than athletic ability."
