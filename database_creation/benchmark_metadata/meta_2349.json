        "Thor is a huge grizzly bear who lives in the Canadian Rockies. He is being hunted by Jim Langdon and his companions through forests and mountains of Canadian wilderness. During his run Thor comes across Muskwa, a motherless bear cub, and takes it under his wing. Together they make a good team, managing to hunt and feed, while being on constant run, but Jim Langdon and hunters are always close.James Oliver Curwood (1878-1927) was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. His adventure writing followed in the tradition of Jack London. Like London, Curwood set many of his works in the wilds of the Great White North. He often took trips to the Canadian northwest which provided the inspiration for his wilderness adventure stories. At least eighteen movies have been based on or inspired by Curwood's novels and short stories."

        "About the Author",
        "James Oliver \"Jim\" Curwood (June 12, 1878 - August 13, 1927) was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. Born in Owosso, MI, the youngest of four children, he left high school before graduation, but passed the entrance exam to the University of Michigan, where he enrolled in the English department and studied journalism. After two years, he quit college to become a reporter. In 1900, he sold his first story while working for the Detroit News-Tribune. By 1909 he had saved enough money to travel to the Canadian northwest, a trip that provided the inspiration for his wilderness adventure stories. The success of his novels afforded him the opportunity to return to the Yukon and Alaska for several months each year and allowed him to write more than thirty such books. He died at the age of 48 of an infection resulting from an allergic reaction to a spider bite. At least eighteen movies have been based on or inspired by Curwood's novels and stories including Jean-Jacques Annaud's 1988 film L'Ours, released in North America as The Bear which was taken from The Grizzly King. Also the 1961 Disney film Nikki, Wild Dog of the North was based on his Nomads of the North.",
