        "Made in Germany, DIPLOMAT writing instruments have been manufactured using traditional methods of craftsmanship since 1922. Diplomat’s Magnum SoftTouch Pen features a lightweight, plastic barrel that makes it ideal for everyday use. But don’t be fooled: This German-made writing instrument performs up to Diplomat’s high standards. The plastic features a soft matte texture (hence the SoftTouch name) that offers excellent grip in conjunction with the multi-faceted design of the section.",
        "This iridescent Magnum fountain pen is one of Diplomat’s most affordable offerings. The special no-slip lacquer gives the body a soft touch, and it has a black ergonomic grip section. It comes equipped with a smooth writing JoWo stainless steel nib, chrome trim, and fills via standard international cartridge/converter. The crystal clear tube comes inside the pen. The matte finish is classic and feels nice to the touch.",
        "This pen looks like a classic pen anyone would carry. It’s interesting shape, lovely matte finish and distinctive acrylic cap button lend style to this cheapish fountain pen. Diplomat Magnum isn’t big like the name implies, its average size and quite lightweight. The nib is stainless steel and the feed does a good job of keeping up with your writing. It comes with cartridges and the ink windows are just cut outs in the plastic on either side which make it easy to see how full the cartridge is.",
        "You can also piggy-back cartridges inside the body by stacking the fat side of each against each other, so you always have a spare ready inside the Magnum. Magnum shines in the nib department. This nib is smooth and the flow is great. The nib does keep up with fast writing and the medium nib writes a medium-thick line. It is a medium writer, not too wet, not too dry. It’s a smooth writer on any paper, Magnum is lightweight. Your hand NEVER gets tired of pushing it across the page.",
        "Diplomat Magnum has a pull off cap that slips on and off easily. The cap posts on the back. Diplomat Magnum is balanced, lightweight and a pleasure and the cap just makes you smile as the design aesthetic reminds you so much of a mechanical pencil."
