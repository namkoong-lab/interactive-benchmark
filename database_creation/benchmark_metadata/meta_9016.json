        "Keshub, a young shepherd boy, lives adventure every day as he defends his flock from predators and proves himself among older brothers. But tales from caravanners who stop at his family’s way-station evoke a longing for adventure beyond the horizons of his own valley in the midst of Canaan. Is he ready for the danger he will encounter when he meets the unloved son of the evil king of the Amorites? Can he deceive his own family to hide the rescued son and a member of the king’s harem? Live the tension of imminent invasion as the Hebrews approach. Too young, by far, he becomes a spy keeping watch over the Hebrew’s movements in the Jordan Valley. Is the greater enemy the ones across the Jordan River or their neighbor, the despicable king? True to scripture and authenticated by archeological research, this tale of God’s grace puts flesh and blood on the enigmatic Gibeonites who make a treaty with Joshua. Shepherd, Potter, Spy―And the Star Namer looks at Joshua’s story from a new point of view. In the end, Keshub becomes a major player in the life of the leader of the Hebrews."
