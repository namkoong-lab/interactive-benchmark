        "When a church hires a new minister, they are really hiring both him and his wife.  Many women entering this role for the first time have never considered what it means to be a minister's wife and consequently suffer stress, chaos, and confusion.  In order to thrive, she needs a solid understanding of the biblical teaching on her role and how to best serve her husband as he fulfills his role.Susie Hawkins brings thirty years of experience as a minister's wife coupled with her role as the mother of two ministry wives.  By focusing on key relationships and responsibilities in relation to the church and home, Susie guides young women to a greater understanding of how to serve God faithfully as the wife of a minister."

        "Susie Hawkins has struck gold with her mining of biblical truth on how to stay balanced in our topsy-turvy, rag-tag journey called Christian ministry.  With this treasure in hand, no wife need lament, \"I wish somebody had told me!\"  God does not send us out as His ambassadors without clear-cut instructions.  Here is a seasoned veteran unearthing nuggets  that pave the way for staying fulfilled and on track.  Our call, our family, the people, the bloopers and the bad times - Susie serves up sensible, do-able and delightful solutions.",

        "-Janet A. Hunt, wife of Pastor Johnny Hunt, First Baptist Church, Woodstock, Georgia",
        "Susie Hawkins' book delivers what it promises. It reads as if one is having an honest conversation with this wise and winsome ministry wife. She is careful not to sugarcoat the disconnects but is also quick to point out the many joys of our high calling. Susie's theological training shines through as she enlightens her readers with interesting anecdotes from church history but especially as she skillfully applies biblical truth. She points us to Scripture at every turn! I highly recommend this much need and well organized book.",
        "-Mary K. Mohler, wife of President Albert Mohler, Jr., The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary",
        "Susie Hawkins has used her compassionate commitment to woman-to-woman ministries to pen winsome wisdom and mentoring maxims for ministry wives. She works effectively and creatively from her own ministry experiences in a variety of venues to explore the 'connections' available for women who are often isolated and lonely because of the burdens they bear and the tasks they face. Hawkins does not shy away from dealing with the 'disconnects' in life, offering helpful and strategic ways to overcome these challenges and find 'reconnections' in the process. You will laugh and cry, reminisce and meditate, consider options and find answers! This book should not be reserved for women married to ministers. Any woman engaged in serving Christ will find encouragement and inspiration in these readable and edifying pages.",

        "The call to be a ministry wife requires a special blend of gifts, emotions, patience, and leadership. It does not, however, come with a set of instructions or a self-guided 'how to' manual. That is why we must be willing to listen to those voices who can speak knowledge into our lives. Susie Hawkins is one of those voices. In these pages, Susie provides a fresh perspective spoken from experience. And she provides insights and wisdom for your life that will prove to be invaluable as your strive daily to fulfill your God-given, glorious calling as a ministry wife.",

        "The Marriage MirrorFinally, a book full of wise counsel for the ministry wife of the twenty-first century. Through current research, historical and biblical accounts, and heartwarming stories, Hawkins explores the ministry wife's varied connections--with her husband, children, friends, ministry family, herself, and above all, her Lord. She offers sound advice to help ministry wives avoid the pitfalls of criticism, people-pleasing, bitterness, failure and stress. Practical and positive, sometimes challenging conventional widsom, her book is a goldmine for the ministry wife who desires to honor and complement her husband's work while developing her own unique personhood. I will recommend this book to every ministry wife I encounter.",
