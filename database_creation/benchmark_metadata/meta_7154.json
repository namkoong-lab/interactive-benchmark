        "The #1 Working Reference on SS7--Revised & Expanded",
        "Signaling System #7 is the hands-down choice for engineers and network managers everywhere. Travis Russell's Signaling System #7, Third Edition, gives you a bedrock understanding of the signaling network, its architecture, and the protocols used to communicate through it. Accessible even to novices, Russell's guide also provides the technical details, protocol messages, and application examples so fundamentally helpful to developers, engineers, and network planners. Network-switching expert Russell brings his succinct, logical style to:",
        "* New coverage on VoIP and SS7-TCP/IP interactions * Solutions to protocol issues in migrating telecom to the Internet * Details on SS7 in broadband and cellular networking * Lucid explanations of protocols and network entities, with hands-on examples and applications * Clarifications of ANSI standards and Bellcore publications, with model solutions *New information on local number portability * Needed technical data for design and specifications"

        "Telephony can be confusing, particularly to people who have spent the bulk of their careers on data networking technologies.",
        "The New McGraw-Hill Telecom Factbook",
        "explains telephone technologies clearly and in detail, with the goal of providing essential and background information to readers who need to buy and manage telecommunications products and services. This book covers relevant technologies, naturally, but also recognizes that commercial and regulatory considerations have significant effects on telecommunications. It's an informative and readable snapshot of the telecommunications industry at the turn of the millennium.",
        "As a rule, telephony is explained in terms of its general concepts, which helps offset the tendency here to refer to North American carriers, trade names, and laws in examples. You'll find plenty of formulas, and sample calculations enhance their value. Instead of just stating the Erlang-C formula, for example, the book shows how to analyze a call center's load pattern for purposes of provisioning equipment.",
        "Telecom Factbook",
        "also distinguishes itself from other general telecommunications texts with its detailed comparisons of competing technologies. Usually, you'll find descriptions of each technology that fits a given need, plus supporting conceptual diagrams. Grids help clarify the technologies' relative strengths, too.",
        "--David Wall",
        "Topics covered:",
        "Data and (especially) voice communications, discussed in a detailed survey form that's ideal for engineers who are exploring alternative solutions, as well as for managers. Coverage includes the standards (both de facto and de jure) that govern equipment, plus the commercial and legal restrains that color the telecommunications environment further.",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "A plain-English guide anyone can use to plan and acquire telecommunications products and services! “If you are looking for accuracy and clarity in acquiring a comprehensive knowledge of today’s complex telecom services and technologies, this book is a single-source instructional masterpiece!” —Dr. Robert E. Conley, served as Assistant Secretary for Electronic Systems and Information Technology in the Department of Treasury, also founder of a successful Information Systems Consulting firm. “No matter what your level of expertise, this plainspoken jargon-free reference equips you with the detailed technology, marketing and business insights needed to successfully manage and participate in the planning, acquisition, and operation of major telecommunications projects” —Dr. J. Neil Birch, President of Birch and Associates, a company he founded after serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense OSD C31 (Command, Control Communications and Intelligence). The NEW McGraw-Hill TELECOM Factbook Second Edition Nowhere is the connection between technology and business success more apparent than telecommunications. No business can exist without telecommunications, and pace-setting businesses are those in which telecommunications and other business operations are so integrally linked that it is difficult to distinguish among them. Yet, to exploit telecom’s benefits requires that one possess at least a rudimentary understanding of new and increasingly complex technological developments. Over the past decade, business telecommunications usage has grown at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, sweeping regulatory changes and the rapid development of new technologies have created so many options that merely remaining abreast of developments has become a major managerial challenge. Numerous \"introductory\" publications, while promising to span the business/technology gap, simply fail to do so. In some cases inadequate scope and/or oversimplification deny the reader insight into technology’s potential to support business applications. Worse yet, some do not contain accurate or complete industry standard terminology - leaving the business-person unable to communicate with industry representatives. Such publications use up valuable time while accomplishing little. The New McGraw-Hill Telecom Factbook is specifically designed as a “knowledge bridge” between business needs and the vast array of telecommunication offerings. It is a state-of-the-art reference resource in that its construct, style, and pedagogy are optimized for the new millennium and its Information Age requirements. Being so comprehensive, the book is not just for business or other people without engineering backgrounds. Even for telecommunications professionals, keeping up-to-date on the plethora of public and private offerings for the delivery of voice, data, image, video, and other telecommunications services has grown into a formidable task. Moreover, it is difficult for engineers to fully appreciate day-to-day business needs and how best to support them with telecommunications applications. Thus, many telecom specialists will find this an indispensable and authoritative resource. Joseph A. Pecar is President of Joseph A.
