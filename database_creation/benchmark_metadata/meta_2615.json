Yet as she gets to know Will better, Ellie starts to uncover some strange things about him. And the school. And even herself. Ellie doesn’t think much of déjà vu, but she just can’t shake the haunting feeling that, somehow, this has all happened before… A long-ago legend comes to new life in this tale of a love triangle, a medieval sword, and a totally awesome pool raft in this stand-alone novel from the",

        "Avalon High, I was starting to think, might not be so bad after all.",
        "Maybe it's not where Ellie wants to be, but if you have to start at a new school, Avalon High is typical enough: There's Lance, the jock. Jennifer, the cheerleader. And Will, senior class president, quarterback, and all-around good guy.",
        "But not everyone at Avalon High is who they appear to be . . . not even, as Ellie is about to discover, herself. As a bizarre drama begins to unfold, Ellie has to wonder, what part does she play in all this? Do the coincidences she's piecing together really mean—as in King Arthur's court—that tragedy is fast approaching for her new friends?",

        "Grade 7 Up–Elaine's parents are on sabbatical and she has to spend her junior year in Annapolis, MD, far from her Minnesota home. While running in the park, she meets Will, and she finds her life intertwined with a familiar story. Too many coincidences, like being named after the Lady of Shalott, and Will's complicated family life make her feel as though she is living in modern-day Camelot. Even her teacher believes that King Arthur will be reincarnated. The author weaves together fantasy, romance, and history. Although the story lacks the humor of Cabot's previous novels, it is well done with good characters and a good dose of style. It will fly off the shelves.",

        "Gr. 7-10. Is it all coincidence, or are dark forces at work? Ellie, the new kid who is starting her junior year at Avalon High, lives with parents, medieval scholars who named her for the lamentable Lady Elaine, aka the Lady of Shalott. Sure there are a few connections to Arthurian legend--similar names, bitter relatives, even an illicit affair--but high-school math teacher Mr. Morton, who belongs to a secret society dedicated to the return of Arthur, believes the Round Table is about to be reenacted in Ellie's present-day Washington, D.C., suburb. If that's so, then Ellie has fallen for the wrong guy. Forget that; Ellie has no intention of letting the past write her future. Using a selection from Tennyson's classic \"Lady of Shalott\" to set up each chapter, Cabot delivers a clever modern take on Arthurian legend, which moves swiftly along to a satisfying, tender conclusion. An entertaining novel that will attract new Cabot readers and as well as the author's devotees.",

        "As a new student, Elaine stumbles onto an impossible truth: some of her classmates are reincarnations of people from Arthurian legend. Elaine falls in love with Will, president of the student council and a quarterback. He chooses to use his middle name rather than his first, Arthur. Elaine is determined to save him from destruction in this suspenseful and fantastic story. Debra Wiseman's portrayal of Elaine as she works through her suspicions helps achieve the story's believability. Her depictions of other key characters further enrich the story, and her poetic pacing of passages from THE LADY OF SHALOTT at the opening of each chapter has just the right touch.
