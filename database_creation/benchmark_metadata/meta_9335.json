        "The higher the score on a factor, the greater the level of government interference and the less economic freedom a country enjoys. The 50 variables are grouped into the following categories: banking and finance, capital flows and foreign investment, monetary policy, fiscal burden of government, trade policy, wages and prices, government intervention in the economy, property rights, regulation, and black-market activity.",

In another new chapter, John Hulsman, Gerald P. O'Driscoll, Jr., and Denise H. Froning of The Heritage Foundation explain the central role that a new Free Trade Association can play in achieving free trade and open borders.",
