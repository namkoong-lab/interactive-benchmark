        "Fifty years is a long time to keep a secret",
        "Looking back on her life, Maggie O’Connor is rightfully pleased. Fifty years ago she left Ireland with a single suitcase and a dream. After a long and satisfying career, she is enjoying retirement on her farm in rural Wisconsin — until she falls.",
        "Determined to regain her independence, she hires Isobel, a young woman who is  also an emigrant. Helping Maggie clean house, Isobel finds a cache of letters that Maggie wrote to her parents those many years ago and begins to read them aloud to Maggie",
        "But the letters contain a secret, one that Maggie has kept for fifty years. A secret that threatens to destroy her life and that of the people around her. With little time left, she must make a choice — give up, or face her past.",
        "A Measured Thread is a powerful story that explores questions of guilt, abandonment, redemption, and the consequences of the choices we make."
