        "\"Congratulations on creating such a great smorgasbord of characters from up north of the bridge. Anyone who has lived here in the U.P. for any length of time will recognize the stories of poverty, loneliness, alcoholism, and isolation. These are characters on the fringes of U.P. culture who have endured long winters and too many months of cabin fever. I especially enjoyed the stories: Tank, The Frying Pan Incident, Aunt Betty's Secret, and Forgive Us Our Sins. The dark humor, even the passive/aggressive behavior, were often hilarious. Who knew that domestic dysfunction could be so entertaining? These characters aren't afraid to speak their minds. It's too damned cold up here to mince words; they have to get right to the point.\" -- Rich Hill, author of",
