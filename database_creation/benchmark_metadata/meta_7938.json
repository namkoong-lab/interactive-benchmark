She's the woman Gloria Steinem called \"the most controversial suffragist of them all.\" In this extensively researched biography, journalist Mary Gabriel has written a comprehensive account of one of American history's most unusual and fascinating women, who, in an era of Victorian morality, was the loudest and most radical voice for women's equality. \"One of the most controversial American women of the late nineteenth century springs to life in this study that leaves no stone unturned.\"--Publishers Weekly; \"Deftly written biography . . .",

        ", but in its more focused way her traditional biography is just as revelatory of larger issues in American society. Gabriel prompts new respect for the feminist who was so scandalous that she was erased from traditional feminist history. Woodhull was an intrepid go-getter who rose from a wooden shack in Ohio to a manor house in England, pausing along the way to become America's first female stockbroker (in 1870) and the first woman to run for president (in 1872).",

        "YA?A fine biography of a little-known 19th-century suffragette. Woodhull's achievements read like fiction, especially considering her times. Born into poverty in 1837 to a family largely unconcerned with nuances of the law, she showed great promise early on. Taking advantage of the contemporary enchantment with spiritualism, she and her sister worked as clairvoyants while teenagers. Married at age 15 to an alcoholic and soon the mother of a retarded child, she worked on the stage until summoned home by her sister. The pair traveled as spiritual healers for several years until guided to New York by Victoria's second husband, James Blood, a progressive idealist who encouraged his wife's interest in women's rights. In New York she and her sister procured a patron, millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt, and established a brokerage firm and a newspaper to voice their liberal views. Both succeeded, testifying to Woodhull's capability, credibility, and vision. She ran for President of the U.S and espoused the fledgling Communist cause. She was a promoter of free love, to the horror of the nation. When it was revealed that she lived with her husband, ex-husband, and lover at the same time, she was widely reviled, financially ruined, jailed on trumped-up charges, and hounded out of the country. Young adults will enjoy her story, and marvel at 19th-century morals. A highly readable addition to biography and women's rights shelves.?Catherine Noonan, Fairfax County Public Library, VACopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "Journalist Gabriel wonders why popular historical accounts of the suffrage movement minimize the role of Woodhull, the tireless, bold, flamboyant, and controversial 19th-century advocate of women's equality. Gabriel covers the familiar: Woodhull as the first woman stockbroker and presidential candidate; first woman to address Congress; as well as Woodhull's spiritualist healing practice, the men in her life, her political radicalism and association with Karl Marx's First International, her free-love philosophy and imprisonment for publishing information on sexuality. Gabriel details Woodhull's efforts to practice her belief that women are truly free when they achieve the right to self-ownership. Gabriel feels that Woodhull's disregard of 19th-century sexual and social morality was the reason for being disowned and vilified by the suffrage movement. Gabriel's flowing narrative is a sympathetic biography of a person who seemed to live before her times. Recommended for academic and research libraries.?Charles L.

        "Victoria Claflin Woodhull Blood Martin (1838^-1927), the \"most notorious and polarizing woman of her day,\" was spiritualist, suffrage leader, stockbroker, publisher/editor, 1872 Equal Rights Party presidential candidate (with Frederick Douglass as running mate), eloquent supporter of free love and socialism, participant in several court battles arising from prominent Protestant minister Henry Ward Beecher's adultery scandal, and in later years, vocal advocate of eugenics.

        "A remarkable biography (the second, after Lois Beachy Underhill's The Woman Who Ran for President, 1995) of one of America's most controversial (and neglected) suffragists. Victoria Claflin Woodhull (18381927) was a clairvoyant, a spiritualist, a stockbroker, a newspaper editor, a women's rights crusader, a presidential candidate, and a sometime prison inmate. Yet shortly before her death, she noted that she wanted to be remembered by a line from Kant: ``You cannot understand a man's work by what he has accomplished but by what he has overcome in accomplishing it.'' A more apt epitaph could not have been chosen for her. Born impoverished to a forger father and an emotionally unstable mother, Woodhull and her sister soon were the sole breadwinners of the very extended Claflin clan, earning a living as spiritualists and healers. But the sisters wanted to get more done. After using their so-called healing powers to aid business tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, he reciprocated with financial assistance in their venture to become Wall Street's first female brokers. Not long after this, Woodhull--who was driven to social reform in part by her experiences in marrying an alcoholic at age 14 and bearing an imbecile son--declared herself a candidate for president of the US, the first woman ever to do so. She was also the first woman to address a congressional committee about women's right to vote. A vibrant, highly opinionated person who espoused free love, Woodhull alienated more than a few of her suffrage contemporaries, notably movement leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. They tried to write her out of feminist history, censoring so many of her reform actions that Gabriel, a Reuters journalist, had to play Sherlock Holmes to piece Woodhull's life together. Well written and researched, this book warrants a spot on every serious American history student's bookshelf. (19 pages b&w photos) --",
