        "An engaging look at reality-based Christian leadership,",
        "The Four Faces of a Leader",
        "has the potential to utterly transform leaders and those they lead—not with bells and whistles, but with a soft whisper of truth about servant leadership. By emphasizing the leadership priorities Jesus demonstrated in the gospels, Rhoden engages the reader with practical applications for all pastors, whether they serve 3,000 or 200 members. Like a personal mentor sharing valuable life lessons, this book challenges, inspires, informs, and encourages. Based on four leadership “faces” of shepherd, servant, steward, and seer, this is a solid roadmap of practical insights for leaders of every generation who want to be the change the world is looking for."
