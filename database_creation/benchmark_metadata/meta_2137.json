        "Three years ago I was miserable. I’d sit at my desk every thinking ‘this can’t be it’. I felt like I was missing out, like there was so much more to life than going back and forth to a windowless office building every day feeling unfulfilled, uninspired and fed up.I needed more. I wanted to explore the world, live in different places, meet different people and let every day be an adventure. I wanted the life I thought might be out there. Maybe you also feel like this from time to time?My dream was get a van, make it into my full-time travelling home and break away. Off into the sunset. To be free, with the whole of Europe (and possibly beyond) as my garden. So that's what I did.Now my life is very different. I live where I want, I do what I want, and travel and adventure are part of every day. I am free of my old shackled life. I decide when and where I work, how much I get paid and what I do with the rest of my time.",
