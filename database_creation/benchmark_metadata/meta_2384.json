        "Chad Anders doesn’t know why mousy Cynthia Henley trips all over her tongue when she’s around him. Nor does he understand his undeniable attraction to this good girl. Wild and sexy is his type, like the dream-girl he caught a glimpse of years earlier he’s never forgotten.Cynthia’s superpower is invisibility, especially with men. It’s better for everyone that way. Besides, she’s got a cat. She’s okay. But when playboy-rancher Chad hires her, she’s got a chance to shine. Professionally, at least. Until she learns of his fascination with a mysterious dream-girl, who was actually nothing more than a shy teenager on an ill-advised dare all those years ago. Cynthia knows she’s no man’s dream-girl and never will be.But there’s magic at the ball. Princesses glow in the starlight, princes appear out of nowhere, and, sometimes, they look a lot like cowboys…"

        "Dear Reader:It's tough running the world, isn't it? Being the one whoalways keeps the toilet paper stocked and never has time to get sick? Or maybeyour version of \"good girl\" runs more to the dreamy side, believing the best ofothers, that your turn will come if you keep playing long enough, staypositive, keep cheering.By definition, it's \"good\" to be a \"good girl.\" We'reself-reliant, empathetic and very strong. But it can also be bad. We run therisk of being overlooked, overworked, underappreciated, underpaid, ignored,taken for granted, passed over. We keep our hands down in class, for fear ofbeing wrong, even though we're usually right. We hide, rather than beembarrassed.That, my friends, is not good at all.The heroine of this story has been a good girl for a longtime, without much to show for it. But when a chance to grab that brass ringappears, she reaches out, despite the likelihood of falling on her face,because failure won't kill her and the risk is worth the reward. This is my hope for you, dear readers: take chances, riskfailure, hold your head and your hands up high and know that the world is yoursfor the taking, whatever that looks like to you.Hugs,Roxanne",
        "From the Inside Flap",
        "Gorgeous, wealthy and fun-loving, Cynthia'sstepsisters drew men like flies to bug zappers. She wished she could hate themfor it, but alas, the worst she could dredge up was irritation. Like you'd feelfor an adorable baby who always steals the show, while yanking your hair out bythe roots. If that baby also puked on your shoes after parties and did notreliably follow through on promises.Cynthia wasn't the kind of woman men like Chad wentfor. They wanted flashy, flirty, quick-witted, smart-mouthed women like herstepsisters, girls who thought on their feet instead of putting them in theirmouths.  On the buffet platter of life, Cynthia wasprocessed cheese, flanked by pineapple and passion fruit.",

        "Pick up where CINDERELLA'S COWBOY leaves off in THE CHOCOLATE CURE, which follows the life of Maddie Cash, stepsister to Cynthia \"Cinderella\" Henley. Other beloved characters have cameo appearances as well, and even more follow in DeeDee Cash's story, THE CHOCOLATE COMEBACK.Readers loved to \"hate\" Cyn's blissfully self-centered twin stepsisters. Now you can find out why Maddie and DeeDee are the way they were... and how giving up everything they thought they wanted helped them become more than they ever dreamed they could be.And maybe find love along the way, too.",

Praised for her strong heroines and true-to-life heroes, her award-winning stories always contain complications arising from modern family dynamics. As a former veterinary technician, mother of three grown daughters and wife of mumble-mumble years, animals, kids and husbands are her forte. Emotional conflict, tears, angst... those wretched \"growth-opportunity\" moments your friends comfort you about... that\\'s what she writes, and readers love it.', \"Earlier in her career, thanks to her veterinary experience, Roxanne wrote a series of non-fiction books about the human-animal bond, as Roxanne Willems Snopek. During that time, she spoke with many fascinating people, and learned much about service animals, particularly dogs for children with autism. She loves including bits about this in her fiction. So far, she's written two books with autism service dogs (Three River Ranch and Finding Home) and one with therapeutic horseback riding (His Reluctant Rancher), all of which were born out of her earlier research. She's also got feral cat colonies, wild mustangs, match-making dogs and lots of other animals.\", \"In her spare time, Roxanne loves to wrangle her suburban wilderness garden, which she shares with deer, coyotes, bear, bobcat and even a cougar, though thankfully she hasn't seen that one. She dabbles in many things, including painting (she uses leftover indoor house paint), piano (still plans to take that Grade 8 exam... one day), yoga (once completed a 100-Day Bikram Yoga challenge), cooking (I can hear you laughing from here, honey) but her favorite thing is, of course, reading. Her list of favorite authors is long and ever-changing, but includes Robyn Carr, Barbara O'Neal, Wendy Corsi Staub, Lois Greiman, Barbara Kingsolver, Sandra Brown, Leah McLaren, Sheila Roberts, Lianne Moriarty... and on and on... you get the picture.\", \"She loves to connect with other book-lovers, so she'd be thrilled if you dropped by her various social media pages. And be sure to click FOLLOW on this page, too, to receive updates about her new releases.\", 'Visit her blog at: www.roxannesnopek.ca (Be sure to sign up for her newsletter)', \"Follow her Facebook at www.Facebook.com/RoxanneSnopekAuthor (you can sign up here, too, if that's more convenient)\", 'And of course, you can follow her on Twitter as well @RoxanneSnopek', 'Thanks for stopping by!']}"
