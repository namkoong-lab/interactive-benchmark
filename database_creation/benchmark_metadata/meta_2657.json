She shares interesting breed information along with stories and anecdotes from their life so you can avoid repeating her mistakes and start your own 'life in tricolour' on the right paw.",

        "Accurate, very helpful and easy to read",
        "Excellent book. Linda has so accurately described the lifestyle one takes on when adopting an Entlebucher and does it with such an enjoyable story. We adopted an entle six months ago and it was fun to read we weren't the only ones challenged at the beginning. She has some great ideas for exercising and keeping these dogs challenged. Highly recommend anyone thinking of getting an entle to read this book, to help make the decision to adopt, or to be prepared for the changes it will make to their lives. (Angela A, February 20, 2018, 5-star review left on Amazon.ca)",

        "e must read....",
        "Absolute must read for those considering a \"Life in Tricolour\" with an Entlebucher Mountain Dog. Having shared the last 7 years with a rescued Entle I can attest to the truths of this well written book. Entle's are wonderful dogs, and this book will give you both sides of their very energetic personalities. Entertaining and Informative. (RKL May 4, 2018, 5-star review left on Amazon.ca)",
        "From the Author",
        "When we chose the Entlebucher breed seven years ago, there really wasn't a lot of information available in English about the breed online or in the bookstores. So with a little help from our wonderful Entle community and a good dog trainer, we had to 'learn on the job', and figure stuff out along the way. These days there are a lot of websites sharing info about the breed basics, but looking back at first few years with our Entlebucher Alfie - all I wanted to know was how to survive puppyhood, what to do about all that energy and whether our Entle was in fact, normal!After blogging about Alfie's adventures on Alfie's Blog since he was a puppy, and getting so many questions about the breed from my readers, I realised that other new Entle owners all over the world felt just the same.  I felt that I wanted to share more about what it was actually like for us to raise one of these little mountain dogs, good and bad, so that other Entle owners could compare notes, and prospective Entle owners could take a peek into our lives and decide whether the breed is the right choice for their family. And so, our high spirited, energetic and mischievous Alfie inspired me to write a book about the Entles which I hope you'll enjoy.Happy Tails,Linda",
        "About the Author",
        "Linda Liebrand's life was turned upside down in 2010 when her superactive Entlebucher Mountain Dog puppy Alfie wagged enthusiastically into her life, stealing her heart - and career - in the best way possible.The mischievous little pup threw down the gauntlet first by training his new human family, a pup school and three local trainers to heel - just like the cattle his breed was bred to herd in the Swiss Alps.Moving from a high-flying corporate-marketing career in London to the countryside to focus on dog training and writing, Linda was determined not to let Alfie rule the pack. She devoted herself to training Alfie, learning everything she could about the lifestyle he needed in order to be a content pup. These days she is a Zen-level master in the art of tiring high-energy dogs out.The full saga is documented on Alfie's Blog, a chronicle of her life living with and training a particularly free-spirited Alfie. The blog, which originally began as a way to stop boring friends with her stories, has since become a favourite bookmark for dog lovers around the world, also appearing as a finalist for Best Design Award at Blogpaws 2014.Linda has several dog books in the works, and these days Alfie is a bundle of tamed mischief at the heart of Linda's young family, all while acting as a daily inspiration for her writing. Linda lives among the rolling green hills in the countryside of Surrey in the United Kingdom together with her husband, toddler and - of course - Alfie. In between copious mugs of tea, she can be found juggling the demands of both toddler and dog, determined to capture every moment on camera and in writing.",
