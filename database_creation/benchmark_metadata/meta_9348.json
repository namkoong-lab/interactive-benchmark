        "In the southernmost part of Florida, Olivia Harding is born privileged. Her father gives her endless love. The silver knife in her back is courtesy of her mother, whose cruel torture plagues Olivia and shatters her mind. She survives her childhood and strives for a normal life: college, a job, and a thrilling romance. But it's all a lie. There's nothing normal about Olivia--so much she can't explain away. Like going to bed after drinking nothing stronger than tea only to wake vomiting what reeks of alcohol, and smelling of cigarettes and floral perfume. After a late-season hurricane threatens the city, Olivia is charged with murder. In jeopardy of losing what's left of her sanity, the man she loves, and possibly her life, she'll have to share her secrets. But to what end?"

        "About the Author",
        "Born into a large Italian, New York family, Lori Flynn began writing at a young age rather than vie for talk-time with her numerous siblings. She currently resides in South Florida, is a mother to two, a wife to one, and a protector to a very special-needs Beagle named Pennington, who fears most things, including thunder, wheels, and tinfoil. This is Lori's second novel."
