She also has several books published by Golden Books, a former subsidiary of Western Publishing. She holds a BA in English Literature, and an MA in Journalism/MassCommunication (professional writing), and worked as both a TA and Lecturer at the University of Oklahoma and Tulsa Community College (formerly TJC). She almost earned a PhD, but lacks her dissertation and one course. She left academia to support her three sons by freelancing, a career choice she thoroughly enjoyed, as she never got bored and often changed hats as many as five times in one day.', \"When Hawkins was four, she endured a year of bedrest, due to a heart murmur. What's a child to do? She taught herself to read--a lifelong passion--and decided that writing books might be a career path. Her first story was published in her school's literary journal when she was 13. Torn between visual arts and writing, writing finally won out after her first year in college. However, after many years, Hawkins has once more resumed her painting, finding joy in watercolors, when she's not writing.\", 'Another passion took a professional turn in 1998 when she produced a children\\'s musical CD, \"Rockin\\' the Day Away\", still available on iTunes.', \"Both of her novels, A DEFECT OF CHARACTER, and the novella, THE GIRL IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM, were published in 2015. Both had earned traditional literary agents, but Hawkins decided to pursue the indie publishing route after a chance encounter with another novelist convinced her that she had become a technical dinosaur. Challenged. she decided to jump out of her comfort zone, and she's not regretted the decision.\", 'Please do contact her. She adores hearing from her readers!']}"
