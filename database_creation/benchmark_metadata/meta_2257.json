        "Haley and Joel's story continues and I am delighted! Becca's characters continue to be well developed and believable. A few new faces. Some old friends and adversaries. The dark end of success gets a bit darker in this edition. Lots of passion. Lots of tension. I could've used more chapters. I didn't want to stop reading!- Stina, Amazon Reviewer Becca Baldwin does it again. We catch up with Haley and Joel In this next chapter of \"A Girl Gone Crazy\" series.
