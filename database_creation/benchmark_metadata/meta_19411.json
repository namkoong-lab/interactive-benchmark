        "If you've ever wondered what it's like to lap 'old' Nurburgring or Brands Hatch in one of the fastest race cars ever built and with a World Champion driver, now's your chance to find out! We put an in-car camera in a works Rothmans Porsche 956 with Derek Bell, giving you a terrific driver's-eye-view as he takes you round seven of the world's greatest racing circuits at up to 220 mph! The car is a 650 bhp world championship-winning racing sports car and the driver's eye-view is riveting - how does the fifth fastest ever lap of the marvelous Nordschleife circuit sound? Or an average of over 120 mph around the spectacular Spa Francorchamps circuit? It's all here on high quality DVD - an exhilarating experience for you to enjoy time and again! The circuits you lap are: Silverstone* 'Old' Nurburgring * Le Mans * Spa Francorchamps * Brands Hatch * Fuji Speedway * Kyalami PLUS! Bonus lap of Mosport - Canada's 'mini Nurburgring' with Vern Schuppan. I didn't appreciate how awesome the 650 hp 956 is, nor how incredible a 6 minutes 41 seconds lap of the old Nurburgring is... The footage is superb... The laps of Le Mans are just devastating. Bell (now an MBE) won Le Mans five times. He is a God.? Evo."
