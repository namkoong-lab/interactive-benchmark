        "From Medicom. Medicom's \"Real Action Hero\" line is a world-renowned series of high-end collector's edition, 1/6th scale action figures, featuring some of the most pose able and realistic bodies ever created, all wrapped in top-quality costumes made with the finest materials and workmanship. DC Comics relaunched the DC Universe in September 2011 with \"The New 52,\" featuring costumes redesigned by Jim Lee. The DC Comics: The New 52: Superman RAH Figure recreates Lee's new interpretation of the Man of Steel as a 12\" tall figure with an impressive costume."
