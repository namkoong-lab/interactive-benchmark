        "Sara has a thing for birds. They remind her of her grandfather, who loved birds, and the wonderful show the creatures would put on in his yard each day―like a cloud of colorful flowers carried by the wind.",
        "As Sara walks to school in her island town, she longs for the freedom of those birds. Then she spots a new birdhouse full of parakeets in someone’s yard. Sara feels drawn to them and unable to forget them. So what happens the next time, when she finds the door to the birdhouse unlocked?",
        "With poetic language and beautiful art, this story set on the African island of Mauritius brings to life a little girl’s deep love of nature, her brash but well-meaning choice, and ultimately, her redemption and dream for a better world."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "K-Gr 3—Patel brings readers a story that is chock full of an emotion many might not be able to name outright: longing. A young girl named Sara notices a large birdhouse in a yard on her way to school. She finds it full of parakeets, birds known for their role as pets. Carrying thoughts of her grandfather, who would feed wild birds each afternoon at home, she opens the doors and frees the parakeets from their cage. Not realizing the gravity of her decision, she thinks only of the longing she feels on behalf of these birds, to have freedom. Certain readers may connect with Sara and this yearning, or perhaps it will prove too philosophical. It's a lovely story, suited for reading aloud with adults, so children can ask questions. Bright illustrations depict the colors of Mauritius, where the story takes place, as noted at the end, which also contains brief information about the places and birds in the story. Tchoukriel's pictures are extremely detailed, lending to the artistry of the book, but are also whimsical enough to capture attention. VERDICT An additional purchase for libraries focusing on developing a collection with diverse authors and illustrators. Could be useful in elementary curriculum collections as a mentor text.—Kristin Unruh",
