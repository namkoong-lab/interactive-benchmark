        "As usual, Montana Coggeshall is hell-bent on doing what’s right, even if what’s right isn’t exactly what’s wise. So he embarks on a quest to vanquish the corrupted ursus, a threat so large they could destroy the entire world of iNcarn8. Does Montana head out after months of training for cold weather conditions, amassing an army, and strategizing with his top aides? Not really. It’s more like he just walks out of his holding one day with a guide and the members of his hirð. They’re just a bunch of angry teddy bears, right?Montana is acting on pure instinct, tinged with a healthy dose of rage. He’s stripped bare, and soon finds himself without food, supplies, a key magic weapon, or even his most loyal friends. Still, he continues.Montana Coggeshall is on the hunt."
