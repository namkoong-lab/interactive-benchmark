        "Product Description",
        "The C430 professional condenser microphone is specifically designed for cymbal and overhead miking. The frequency response of the C430 ensures a uniquely crisp sound which often reduces the need for external EQs. With its extremely compact external dimensions, the C430 microphone will keep a low profile in any application without compromising audio quality.",
        "From the Manufacturer",
        "The C 430 is the latest addition to the MicroMic Series III. Its small size, high SPL handling and frequency shaping make it ideal for on-stage or in-studio instrument and percussion micing applications. Its uniform cardioid polar pattern means that the mic \"hears\" more evenly from the sides. This is the best choice for instruments that radiate sound from many directions like acoustic guitar, piano, saxophone and percussion instruments. This is also a good trait for better gain before feedback when used on stage.",
