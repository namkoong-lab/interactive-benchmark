        "Numbers LE is the free version of the Numbers PCE App. It features features written interpretations from the book \"Numerology - Multiple Digits & Decanates\" by Esther V. Leinbach. These unique intepretations include numbers up to 100, however in this free version all names and birthday numbers are reduced to a single digit. Numerology offers a variety of uses beyond typical name and birthday interpretations. For example, you may wish to learn more about a house number, license plate, company name, even a simple word or phrase. In addition, no study of Numerology is complete without an examination of cycles. Each day presents a new numerological flavor, while the first of each month starts everyone on a new monthly cycle. Also, every year on your birthday, a new numerological cycle begins.To use this app, simply enter a name and birthday and tap the button to read the report. Features include: 1. Complete name/number analysis including vowels, consonants, master numbers & name suffix (e.g, Jr., III). 2. Supports up to 4 names or words. 3. Report includes Name and Birthday numbers. 4. Save the names of all of your friends for quick access. 5. NO ADS!"
