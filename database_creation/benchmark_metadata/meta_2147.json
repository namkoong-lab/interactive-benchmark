        "“My father…” Deb hesitated and motioned to her brothers. “Our father, once told us that he could take America with five hundred American Special Operation Forces.”“Are you suggesting that American Special Forces are planning an attack?” interrupted General McClinton.“No sir. Absolutely not.” Deb had the full attention of everyone at the table. “These are foreign infiltrators who want to change our way of life.”When Foreign powers storm the U.S. borders, they use EMPs and gangs to paralyze American cities and the heartland. Colonel Deb Lisco works to protect our nation while her brother Ted and his granddaughter, Maddy struggle to find their way home to Colorado after their flight is forced down in Utah. Hank, Jon, and their families flee the chaos in the Denver suburbs and travel to the Lisco stronghold on the eastern plains. The encounters the family have with strangers along the way show the best and worst of the human spirit.Book one in the",

        "An easy to read and interest grabbing book! While fiction, it is easy to see something like this happening. It makes you wonder if you shouldn't start \"preparing\" for such a catastrophic event... Highly recommend. The last book I tried to read I could only read for half an hour before needing a break. I read this in two nights. I found it to be one of those where you want to know how it ends and cannot wait to find out. Goodreads reader",
        "Great book that draws you in constantly on \"what will happen next\". This book has a really good outlook on family, friends, and relationships during complete social unrest. Must Read! Goodreads reader",
