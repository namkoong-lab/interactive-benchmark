        "what do you mean when you say I? normally we would respond by saying a center of awareness or a feeling of empowerment/selfishness. but after answering that question, another question comes which is “who is the one aware of yourself?\" fire cannot burn itself in the same way you cannot look into your own eyes without using a mirror. by being aware of this illusionary feeling of a self, there is a separation. and if you think about that long enough to realize that there is no self, who is it that knows there is no ego? we often hide behind the masks we create; the mask embedded into our skin. we try to find our real selves in our mask which only leads from one maze to another. lost between sanity and madness. what would it be like to remove the mask you don’t remember putting on? what would it be like to know that you didn’t have to hold onto yourself so tight? these are questions we avoid because we aren’t sure just how deep the rabbit hole can go. but there's always a way out of an illusion. you might not be the you that you think you are.

        "Review",
        "\"It's a strange exercise of the brain, reading this book. It's almost doing sit-ups and looking in on itself. A little dizzying but how often does your mind get to do adventure sports. It was a strange and refreshing read that left me in a introspective mood. It's the perfect read for anyone who likes to be haunted with their thoughts long after the book is over, but in wonderful ways. Go in with an open mind, and you will leave a different person.\" -",
        "Literary Titan",
        "\"The collection takes the reader on a personal journey undergoing the hard task of deconstructing the paradoxical relationship between what we can refer to as the \"real self\" and the ego. Some of the passages jolt us like a cold breeze, others like a warm cup of coffee in the morning. It sets out a clear intention to awaken those who have succumbed to life's lethargies, reminding us of the abundant pleasures on offer to those willing to receive them.",

        "\"Paradox\" is a combination of Poetry, Philosophy, and Psychology that goes into the nature of what is oneself. This book of poems will be different for every reader. Some may view this as poetry about love and death, poetry about oneself or even just a story of what it would be like to wake up as a different person. I'd like to remind you that I am not advocating any form of belief system or that you believe anything I write about. I am not asking that you agree with me.

        "Although identified as a poetry collection,",
        "Paradox",
        "does not follow traditional poetic structures. Rather, it is a composition of jumbled thoughts that appeal directly to our emotions, destabilizing our foundations and disconnecting our self - or soul, as the author puts it - from superficial attachments. (Perhaps this detachment is also the reason behind the author choosing to remain anonymous). Reading",
