        "Throughout Omnivore Recordings' 12-year relationship with the Buck Owens Private Foundation, one request from the fans was clear and consistent-to make Buck's late-'60s/early-'70s releases available again as stand-alone reissues. Omnivore is proud to answer that call and announce 9 titles to be released throughout the summer and fall of 2021. The albums will be released as they were originally issued and for the first time, appear in their original configuration on CD and Digital, mastered from the original analog tapes, and with expanded artwork and new liner notes. Originally released in July of 1970, The Kansas City Song gave Owens another top 10 entry on the country album charts. All ten of the songs were written or co-written, by Owens, including the title track which hit #2 on the country singles charts. It also began Buck's run of \"city centered\" material, which would come to fruition later that year on the hit release I Wouldn't Live In New York City."
