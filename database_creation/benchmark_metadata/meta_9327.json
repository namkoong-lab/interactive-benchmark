        "From Library Journal",
        "Because water supports the body while providing resistance to body movement, water-workout pioneer Huey maintains that water training provides all the benefits of more strenuous forms of exercise without the risk of injury. These features make water training a versatile form of exercise that almost everyone (from runners and weight trainers to senior citizens and pregnant women) can enjoy. Designed for people wishing to vary their workouts and for those recovering from injuries, this definitive guide offers an impressive range of exercise programs--emphasizing balanced strength, aerobic and anaerobic fitness, and flexibility--in deep and shallow water for both swimmers and nonswimmers. Clear, concise instructions are given for each of the workout programs--waterpower, deep waterpower, dance-specific, sport-specific, and lower-body, upper-body, and post-surgical rehabilitation. Recommended for both lay readers and specialists. (Photographs not seen.)-- Linda Chopra, Cleveland Heights-University Heights P.L., OhioCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
