        "From the Author",
        "The idea for Nosie Adventures started because my husband always wanted to kiss my \"nosie\".He would tell me that the nosies-his and mine-would play and do amazing things during the day.  Before long, we were making up stories about the activities of the nosies. Did you know that your nose has a secret life?  I hope you will enjoy this book. Check out the first one too if you missed it.  Nosies spread positive messages of love and acceptance.",
