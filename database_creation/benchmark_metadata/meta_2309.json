        "About the Author",
        "Jeremy Blankenship wrote Poop on the Shoe many years before it became an actual book. But in 2017, Jeremy met digital artist Kim K. Whittemore at an art festival in Minneapolis, MN and brought up the book idea to her. Kim instantly loved the idea of the book and upon receiving the manuscript a few weeks later started sketching ideas to bring it to visual life. Almost a year later the book was finished. Poop on the Shoe was their first collaberation together, but also their first book experience separately.",
