He owes his early success in large part to the fabled series: SEE SPOT RUN. From there, it was off to the races. An introduction to writing occurred with his membership into Goodreads; it was the driving force that stoked the writer in him.', \"Paul's first publication began with an essay, DIRT TO DIGITAL. That's all it took to get him rolling. In no time, CAGED, his first novel surfaced. Just a few months later, his sequel appeared - THE LINE. He has since published his final book of a trilogy, EARTHBOUND.\", \"Paul received his master's degree in Audiology from San Diego State University. He owned and operated a private practice in the East County of San Diego for a number of years.\"]}"
