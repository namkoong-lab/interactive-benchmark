        "When everyday concerns and problems don't subside--when desires of the heart go unmet--it's easy for people to wonder if they've done something wrong or if God cares. In this deeply personal book, Leslie Haskin explores the common challenges and longings in life that can erode faith. Avoiding pat answers, she offers biblical insights and real-life stories to stir the heart and renew the mind. Much more than just a good inspirational book, she gently persuades readers to deal honestly with their hurts and rest fully in the arms of God."
