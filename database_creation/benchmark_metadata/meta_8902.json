        "Fact: A large number of Playboy's readers do buy the magazine for the articles-specifically the interviews. The Playboy Interviews is incisive and entertaining, and important figures from all walks of life-many of whom honor no other interview requests-have given life- and career-altering interviews in the magazine's pages. The Playboy Interviews: They Played the Game features some of the most revered-and reviled-American sports stars from the past six decades openly discussing controversial issues including race, gender, drugs, and sexuality. More than just a bunch of jocks talking sports, these interviews are a fascinating reflection of the American psyche and evolving cultural perceptions. Includes interviews with Jim Brown, Joe Namath, Billie Jean King, O. J. Simpson, Pete Rose, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Barry Bonds, Mike Tyson and Dale Earnhardt Jr."

        "'s \"legendary\" interviews, starting here with a galaxy of 17 athletes, dating from the years 1968 (Jim Brown) to 2005 (Lance Armstrong) and including Henry Aaron (1974), Pete Rose (1979 and 2000), Dale Earnhardt Jr. (2001), and O. J. Simpson (1976 and",
        "2003). Except for the later Rose and Simpson pieces, nearly all the interviews took place while the athletes were actively competing, if not in their prime. Each interview includes its original introduction, the only new material here being a two-page preface to the collection. However undemanding it might have been to pull this collection together, it offers luminous insights into the nature of competing at the highest levels of these sports, whether it's Brown explaining how he evades a 300-pound defensive tackle or Earnhardt explaining the nuances of a 195-mile-per-hour traffic jam. And there are many wonderfully candid comments, like Wayne Gretzky modestly remarking, \"I don't think you can become too famous as a hockey player.\"",
