        "About the Author",
        "Writing has been a passion for Janice Carter from a young age but her 'second' career after teaching didn't officially start until she took a romance writing course at a local community college. The story she began then became her debut novel, a Harlequin Intrigue. Janice says she's been very lucky to do what she enjoys most--writing about the connections between people and their families; in other words, how we find love and romance.",
