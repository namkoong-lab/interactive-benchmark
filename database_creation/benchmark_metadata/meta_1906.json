        "100% LEAK PROOF: For a moisture-free, damp-free and condensation-free vehicle or boat, choose ZARPAX's humidity absorber. Our marine dehumidifier contains silica that eliminates condensation and moisture from the air creating and maintaining an incredibly fresh environment! The moisture absorber is 100% leakproof meaning you will never have to contend with leakage or stains, only a dry interior and gleaming windshields & boat interior!",
        "LONG LASTING FRESHNESS: ZARPAX'S RV & Marine dehumidifier is handily reusable and engineered to be as durable and long-lasting as possible. They are recharged with both ease and speed to ensure a permanently unclouded and crystal-clear windscreen. There is no predetermined expiry date on our moisture absorbers and the reusable nature of the dehumidifier bags guarantees durability and a long life combating condensation.",
        "AMPLE CAPACITY: Our moisture absorbers for cars, RV's and marine vehicles are a substantial size of 16.2oz, equipped with a larger capacity for bigger vehicles and boats. ZARPAX's dehumidifier packets ensure long-lasting dryness. The dehumidifier bag can be stored anywhere in the vehicle or boat, and if desired, can be easily concealed and will still operate effectively even if out of sight.",
        "DIRECTIONS OF USE: An intelligent design, ZARPAX's dehumidifier bags are incredibly easy to use. Once placed in the desired vehicle or boat, the water-retaining dehumidifier fills with moisture present in the air. The humidity indicator will then slowly change from blue to pink. Once the indicator has changed colour, it has reached absorption capacity & must be put into the microwave (2x6 minutes)."
