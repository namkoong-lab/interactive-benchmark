        "PEPPERMINT",
        "A perennial plant. The bush is branched, 15 to 30\" tall. Leaves are ovoid, serrated, dark green, and have a strong aroma. The fresh and dried leaves, young shoots, and flowers are used for flavoring tea, various drinks, and confectionery. They can be added to salads, vegetable, and meat dishes or used as a spice in pickling cucumbers, zucchini, and tomatoes.",
        "Planting instructions:",
        "For spring planting, mint seeds can be started indoors in late winter or direct-sown in the warm spring soil. But as a hardy perennial, they can be started anytime until about 2 months before the first frost of fall, or year-round for indoor use. To sow the seeds indoors, place them on top of the medium in your seed flat. Do not cover the seeds; they need light to germinate. They should sprout within 10 to 15 days at room temperature or slightly warmer (68 to 75°F). Transplant into the garden or container when they have at least 2 sets of true leaves. To sow the seeds outdoors, place them on top of well-worked soil, then sprinkle a fine layer of vermiculite on top of them. If you are sowing directly into the garden, consider placing a row cover over the seeds until they sprout. Mint thrives best in partial shade and rich, moist soil. However, it is famously unfussy, so chances are it will not only survive but flourish in any light from full sun to deep shade, and any quality of soil provided the drainage is decent. Many gardeners deliberately plant it in less favorable conditions to slow down its spread! Space plants 12 to 18 inches apart in the garden. Avoid using fertilizer on mint."
