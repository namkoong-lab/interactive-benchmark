        "TAGLINE: \"A lady of the night can sell anything...even her life!\" A police inspector combs the streets of a crime-ridden city in search of a deadly sniper. The murderer selects only prostitutes as victims. \" In the sleazy, crime-ridden streets of this major metropolis, it is one man's job to harness a shadowy sniper. Based on the novel \"The Sin Sniper\" by Hugh Garner.\" VIEWER COMMENT: \"Just to see Paul Williams, Julius Kurtz, playing a big time city pimp should make \"Stone Cold Dead\" worth watching. With the always reliable Richard Crenna, Sgt. Boyd as the Toronto cop with an obsession for putting Kurtz away and off the streets to make the city safe. Some deranged sniper has been offing prostitutes and at the same time photographing them and sending the photos to the police to taunt them and make them feel helpless in catching him. Sgt. Boyd thinks that it's Kurtz that's the killer and is out to get the goods on him. You would wonder why Kurtz would kill his own employees and hurt his prostitution business? Does Boyd know something? Fairly good whodunit with a surprising performance on the part of Paul Williams as the cool pimp with a heart of gold when it comes to taking good care of his \"ladies\" even though he can be rough some times but as everyone watching the movie knows Julie doesn't really mean it. A very effective and sympathetic scene in the film is when Kurtz is at a funeral of one of his murdered \"ladies\" and Sgt. Boyd arrives uninvited hassling him. Kurtz then quietly tell him \"Can't you see that I'm here to pay my respects\". It just made me wonder who was the good guy and who was the bad guy in the movie. Sgt. Boyd gets really involved in the murder case when one of the hookers murdered by the sniper turns out to be a woman undercover detective who's also a good friend of his and it all becomes very personal with him. The ending of the movie is made to shock and surprise and it does very convincingly with the audience not seeing it coming. \"Stone Cold D"
