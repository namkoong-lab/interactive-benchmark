        "BATTERY POWERED - The BCPM-A2 is an active device and runs on two AAA batteries. This gives the advantage of boosting the incoming signal with the active amplifier. If you need a little more level than the source is giving you, just turn up the volume",
        "VOLUME CONTROL - The volume knob / power switch is positioned at the end of the BCPM-A2 where it's easy to reach, even without looking. If you're sitting behind a keyboard or drum kit, changing the monitoring volume in your headphones is trickier than it sounds. If you can't walk over to the headphone amp or give the \"more volume\" sign to the sound engineer, the BCPM-A2 is for you. It puts a volume knob right at your belt, so you can dial in the perfect monitor level any time you need it",
        "MONO/STEREO SWITCH - The internal mono/stereo switch lets you select the mode that meets your needs. Select stereo when you connect to a headphone output or other stereo source. Select mono when you connect to a single-channel source such as a mono aux send from a mixer",
        "COMBO INPUT JACK - Because monitoring is so critical to your performance, the XLR jack features a locking mechanism to prevent the connector from accidentally disconnecting—like if there's a little tug, or even if someone trips over your cable. When you're done, just press the locking tab to disconnect. Not using an XLR cable? No problem. The BCPM-A2's combo jack accepts 1/4\" connectors, too",

Ideal for keyboardists or drummers who stay in one spot while performing, the BCPM-A2 will deliver the audio feed you need without excessive cabling or clutter.",
        "Designed as the active version of the Polsen BCPM-1, the BCPM-A2 is powered by two AAA batteries (available separately). The active amplifier circuitry gives you the advantage of boosting the input signal when you need extra volume in your headphones. Plus, the mono/stereo switch lets you choose the monitoring mode that matches your input source. The convenient belt clip ensures the BCPM-A2 won't be in the way while you play.",
