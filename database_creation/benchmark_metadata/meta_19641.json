        "Helen Morgan has beauty, talent, success. Yet they mean nothing to her without the love of Larry Maddux, the bootlegger who leads Helen on and drops her so often she finally hits bottom. Set in the roaring ’20s, The Helen Morgan Story is also Maddux’s story. In his fifth film, Paul Newman plays the mobster with slick assuredness. In her final movie, Ann Blyth portrays the troubled songstress (and Show Boat original cast member), with Gogi Grant performing vocals on signature Morgan tunes. Appearances by ’20s icons Rudy Vallee, Walter Winchell and Morgan’s real-life accompanist Jimmy McHugh bring bracing authenticity to this tale of a legend whose songs could heal any heart but her own.",

        ", a musical bio of the great 1920s torch singer, begins with a scene of flappers and jazz babies spontaneously dancing on a train. If you can buy into that kind of crazy history, you might just enjoy this tuneful 1957 drama, the rise-fall-comeback of a tragic showbiz figure (which neglects to include the tragic final act).

We watch Morgan's early successes crooning in speakeasies, and her wrong moves in her personal life; seems the lady just can't help lovin' a no-good gangster, played by Paul Newman (still very early in his career). Newman's character keeps showing up, like a bad penny, even after Helen is taken up by a wealthy (and married) lawyer, played by Richard Carlson. The many heartbreaks eventually lead to alcohol addiction, which killed the real Morgan in 1941, although the film stops short of her unfortunate ending. Morgan's success in the original production of",

        "goes by quickly, but the movie includes a decent roster of songs from various stages of her career. Michael Curtiz directed, and his dark eye (and Ted Tetzlaff's widescreen black-and-white cinematography) gives the movie a pleasing film-noir overlay. The biggest problem is Blyth, too small for the role and finally defeated by the simplistic diagnosis of Morgan's problems. Blyth's singing voice was dubbed by Gogi Grant, who has a strong voice that doesn't especially sound like Morgan's.",
