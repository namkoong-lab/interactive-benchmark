        "Review",
        "This introduction to snow could be very useful for teachers to read aloud. It is big enough to share with a class and the photographs are full page so that students can easily see them. . . .The photography is the outstanding feature of this book, particularly the close-ups of snowflakes.-- \"Reading Today Online\"This series is a nice addition to a school library that needs more materials to support the science standards for their youngest students. Each book describes and illustrates the topic with large text and amazing photographs. Words and phrases are repeated for maximum effect.-- \"Library Media Connection\"",
