Some scary, some not. Most of the time trying to sound just like Stephen King, or Edgar Allen Poe, or Richard Matheson. One thing I knew for sure - I'd found my love. My Passion.

I hope you enjoy my stories and I hope we get a chance to meet someday. We can discuss the land of make-believe.', \"Take care, my reader. There's more to come.\"]}"
