        "Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History",
        "In the Whitechapel neighborhood of London in 1888, five women were horribly mutilated and murdered by the infamous killer, Jack the Ripper. Though there were many suspects, the monster was never caught.",
        "This recently discovered memoir from the 1920s introduces a new suspect: James Willoughby Carnac, a little-known figure who claims to have been the Ripper. Carnac describes the events and geography of Whitechapel in 1888 with chilling accuracy, including details of the murders that appear to have been unavailable to the public at the time. He presents a credible motive for becoming Jack, and, for the first time ever, a reason for ending the killing spree. Ultimately, you, the reader, must decide if this is simply one of the earliest imaginings of the case―and a groundbreaking literary addition to the Ripper canon―or if it is the genuine autobiography of Jack the Ripper himself.",

        "\"Even if it’s merely a cleverly-written novel (\"Ripperature\" ), the book is well done. And if there’s a remote, outside chance that it’s a real account by the gruesome killer, the thought is enough to cause nightmares while reading it.\" ―",

        "A Bookish Affair",
        "\"The way the plots are intertwined in the book, the way the narrative traces the genealogy of this criminal and the way it portrays the heady mixture of cold violence inside and lust for blood makes this book worth reading by every book lover. It does not really matter whether it is another Ripperature or a genuine story of Jack the Ripper, what is more important is the racy, teasing and explosive details it offers. I foresee floodgates of inquisitiveness and debates as soon as this book hits the market.\" ―",
        "BookPleasures.com",
        "\"Carnac (no affiliation given, because he’s supposed to be the Ripper) recounts the story of a childhood marked by the signs that he was going to become the Ripper, at the time of the murders. He apparently was sane enough to remember in gory detail the five murders, and the few weeks in which he anxiously searched the streets for his victims. The descriptions of the murders cross closely with what is now known of them; the Ripper then has the presence of mind to disappear and leave the autobiography, with which he was engaged at the time, behind him.\" ―",
