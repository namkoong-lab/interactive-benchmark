Animals who like to dress up, especially the animals who work at COVER magazine. Mitford would do ANYTHING to work there. But first Mitford must prove himself. Can Mitford survive the",

        "From School Library Journal",
        "K-Gr 2—The cool-headed, long-necked protagonist of Mitford at the Fashion Zoo returns, this time reacting to a fashion emergency on the West Coast. The superchic giraffe is dispatched by his flamboyant boss, Panda Summers, to rescue Rhinoana, the celebrity singer and Cover magazine cover model, whose cotton-candy dress has disintegrated. With the aid of some Zoom Juice, the difficult-to-fit diva is stepping out in style at the Academy Zoowards. While Mitford is at it, he also helps Meryl Sheep electrify the red carpet. But what can Mitford do for Shark Whaleberg? And with his last-minute assignment, will the giraffe himself be able to dress to impress and win his coveted promotion to fashion editor? Do you have to ask? This ludicrous look at the fashion world is delivered with sass and flash. The loose line drawings and splashes of color work perfectly to suggest the world of haute couture and the engaging animal characters. The sly plays on celebrity names and brands might not mean anything to a child audience, but the zooish humor and inspired silliness might appeal to budding fashionistas and runway stars. VERDICT This offering is all about style over substance, and, as such, it is an over-the-rainbow addition.—Luann Toth, School Library Journal",

Sassy and inspiringly drawn: a funny, captivating treat for the eyes and imagination.” —",
