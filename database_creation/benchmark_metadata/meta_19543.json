        "Tim Hawkins brings down the house at the beautiful Carson Center in Paducah, Kentucky. In the unique style that his fans love, Tim delivers gut-punching standup along with his trademark song parodies and original music. A former All-American baseball player, Tim traded the sports stage for the comedy stage and never looked back. The St. Louis native taught himself to play guitar and tested the waters at area youth events and comedy clubs. Today, this father of 4 plays to packed auditoriums and theaters throughout North America, and his DVDs are sold worldwide."
