        "Setting the Stage promotes a “Learner’s Brain Model” using brain research to understand the nature to the learner so teachers can develop lessons based on the nature of the learner. There is also a focus on student self-regulation. The first chapter is devoted to the nature of the learner so teachers and administrators can begin a reflection process of determining what they do and how the learner learns to see if there is a match between what is taught and how it will be processed. Too often low student achievement and school turnaround is focused on “fixing” teachers and not on understanding the learner enabling teachers to adapt their strategies more effectively. Strategies which address student learning lead to more effective lessons. Following the nature of the learner, subsequent chapters discuss planning lessons that make sense and have meaning so the information gets stored in long term memory. Once information is in long-term memory, it is retrievable for use. Strategies are provided throughout the book supported by brain research to help teachers plan lessons."

        "Review",
        "What is different about Dr. Barbiere's approach is that he uses a combination of brain-based learning and self-regulation of learning to help guide learners through practical approaches that educators can employ immediately in their classrooms. What's more, Dr. Barbiere stands behind his espoused practices: he is in classrooms every day and has the benefit of having observed and implemented his tools in literally hundreds of classrooms in all socioeconomic and demographic populaces. Dr. Barbiere shares practical tools and strategies for the educator to employ. More significant is that these practices help the learner to self-motivate, reflecting actively on their own learning and using these strategies to monitor their own progress. This is an empowering and important strategy for learners, especially those with learning and/or demographic disadvantages. I endorse this text with full confidence that once the reader utilizes any or all of the research-based strategies discussed, you will see immediate differences in your classroom, school or district, as I have in my own, thanks to the guidance and measurable methods provided within the text. -- Michael S. GaskellAs a Principal, I have often used materials created by Dr. Barbiere (\"Doc\") to improve teaching and learning in our school. Our focus has been on the most salient practices of instructional leadership and we have had great results! The materials are an adaptable resource and have offered a practical approach to coach and mentor our teachers. -- Michael Heidelberg, Perth Amboy SchoolsDr. Barbiere’s wealth of proven successful experiences improving student’s social, emotional, and intellectual lives shines through Activating the Learner’s Brain. We can learn from this master by reading his straight-shooting, practical strategy book that combines the best years of experience and the widely regarded research and literature. I see Activating the Learner’s Brain in every school’s professional learning community study group! -- Scott Taylor, superintendent, Highland Park Schools #allinhp; adjunct, Rutgers University and Montclair University; facilitator, Academy for Social-Emotional Learning in Schools",
