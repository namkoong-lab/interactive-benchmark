        "About the Author",
        "Martha Zschock lives with her family on Cape Cod. A former elementary school teacher, she was inspired by field trips with her students to write her first book, Journey Around Cape Cod from A to Z. Martha's journey has continued with more books in the series from other places including, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Chicago, Maine, Nantucket, and New York. Martha and her family enjoy the journey of creating the series, which includes lots of traveling, writing, painting, and meeting lots of wonderful children and adults along the way. Martha often collaborates on projects with her twin sister, Heather, an art director and freelance designer. When her twin sister had a baby, Martha began writing and painting for a new Hello! series of board books which take the youngest explorers on journeys to several locations such as Florida, Brooklyn, Washington DC, Boston, Yellowstone, and America."
