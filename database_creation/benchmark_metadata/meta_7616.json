        "About the Brothers Series from the School Library Journal",
        "Gr 5-8--",
        "Brothers Isaac and Victor get taken from their family after their mother commits a crime in this realistic look at life in the foster care system. The story is told through emails exchanged between the siblings, who are indifferent foster homes, as they grapple with being apart. While Isaac is placed with a loving foster family, he encounters bullying and social difficulties in a new situation. Victor cycles through several homes ashe gets involved with ill-conceived schemes that get him in trouble. The engaging page layouts feature doodle-style drawings, representing images the two brothers are sending to each other in their emails, and the book covers are eye-catching. The series presents a realistic yet accessible look at a family encountering stressful circumstances.",
        "VERDICT",
        "Written at a second and third grade reading level, \"Brothers\" is an unflinching exploration of a family navigating foster care.",
        "About Taken Away (Book 1 of Brothers) from the Kirkus Review",
        "Debut author Bermudez kicks off a new series focusing on the relationship between two brothers separated by the foster-care system. Isaac still remembers how the arroz con leche splattered everywhere the day the police came for him and his siblings, the broken bowl and scattered rice a resonant metaphor for how his family had fallen apart.Older brother Victor tells Isaac not to worry about the rice; as the oldest, Victor is the stiff upper lip for the family,determined to keep it together despite the siblings' physical separation. Isaac and Victor manage to stay in touch via email, sharing their thoughts and struggles with new foster parents, school bullies, and mysterious neighbors.Through it all they hold out hope for mending their family and all finding their way back to one another. The story is sincere and heartfelt; though brief, it packs an emotional punch and does so without sacrificing character and plot.The brevity makes it an appealing option for reluctant and low literacy readers who still want a sustained story. A bit of an abrupt ending will have readers eager to see if the boys' wishes are ultimately fulfilled. Isaac and Victor are both of Mexican descent.The book's design may have readers confused, with a cover that looks like a YA thriller and (uncredited) interior illustrations that look distinctly childlike. A necessary narrative with an ambiguous design.",
