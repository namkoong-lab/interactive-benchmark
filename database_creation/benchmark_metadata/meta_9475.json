        "About the Author",
        "Rachel Dougherty is a Philadelphia-based illustrator and children’s author. She works with fascinating facts, acrylic paint, and pencil smudges, aiming to inspire curious young minds. Rachel is passionate about US history, scruffy little dogs, and board games, and she believes that some of the best stories out there are the true ones.Rachel Sanson is an illustrator who was born deep in the north of England and is currently living in Manchester. She graduated from the University of Lincoln with a degree in illustration after three years in a little studio perched on the top of a hill. Rachel usually works digitally, incorporating bright colors, patterns, and textures into her work, and strives to come up with big, larger-than-life characters for children’s picture book stories. Her biggest influences are all things Halloween and pirate-related, games, film, the woods she grew up next to, and, of course, illustrators from her childhood. Rachel can usually be found in a corner sketching and drinking tea but spends her free time chasing cats, listening to embarrassing music, and watching horror films until the early hours of the morning."
