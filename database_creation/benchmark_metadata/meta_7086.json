        "FRANKENSTEIN: THE DEAD TOWN The war against humanity is raging. As the small town of Rainbow Falls, Montana, comes under siege, scattered survivors band together to weather the onslaught of the creatures set loose upon the world. As they ready for battle against overwhelming odds, they will learn the full scope of Victor Frankenstein’s nihilistic plan to remake the future — and the terrifying reach of his shadowy, powerful supporters. Now the good will make their last, best stand. In a climax that will shatter every expectation, their destinies and the fate of humanity hang in the balance. “Koontz is a master of the edge-of-your-seat, paranoid thriller and perhaps the leading American practitioner of the form.” —The Star-Ledger “Koontz writes first-rate suspense, scary and stylish.” —Los Angeles Times “A rarity among bestselling writers, Koontz continues to pursue new ways of telling stories, never content with repeating himself. He writes of hope and love in the midst of evil in profoundly inspiring and moving ways.” —Chicago Sun-Times"
