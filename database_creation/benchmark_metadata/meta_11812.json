        "Beautiful, functional, and ultra-thin, the Lenovo L24e-30 computer monitor combines powerful performance in an elegant package. This minimalist monitor makes a stylish centerpiece for any modern home. At just 7.1 mm thick, its ultra-slim screen head is thinner than many phones, while its 3-side NearEdgeless frame proves that less is more; the thin bezels let movies, coursework content, or even spreadsheets seem to float weightlessly in front of you. Place two side-by-side for a practically gapless view. The L24e-30s VA panel display produces the same faultless colors in every direction, even when viewing from angles as extreme as 178°, so everyone watching a video together will see exactly the same great image. For school, work from home, everyday computing tasks, or entertainment, this powerful desktop monitor delivers performance as good as it looks. Enjoy gameplay free from ghosting, streaking, and torn images thanks to AMD FreeSync™ and a rapid 75 Hz refresh rate. Need to change the screen settings or fine-tune the monitor's brightness or contrast? With Lenovo's exclusive and dedicated Artery software, you get instant control of every aspect of display, in a joyfully simple on-screen interface that waves goodbye to unresponsive button-pushing. Easily shift settings to match different work, entertainment, or gaming scenarios so that you always get the best performance.All great designs have firm foundations, and the L24e-30 full HD monitor's ultra-slim display stands on an equally elegant sculpted wedge stand with hidden cable management to keep its clean lines unspoiled and your space free from clutter. It also has an integrated phone holder to keep your mobile at a convenient viewing angle. This thoughtfulness of design extends to your comfort as well; reviewing documents late into the night needn't be so tiresome since its TÜV Rheinland Eye Comfort-Certified technology filters harmful wavelengths to protect your eyes from fatigue."
