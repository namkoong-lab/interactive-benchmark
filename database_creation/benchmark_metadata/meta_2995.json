        "Reviewed in the United States �������� on February 8, 2023This book sooo easy to follow. It's written step-by-step, so any prospective gardener can begin it and have a lush bed-garden when they reach the end. The writing is so engaging yet calming--like an old familiar friend sharing her secrets with me. It's a short book, but it gets to the point in the comfiest and most accessible way. I'm interested in reading more from this author, especially if it's more gardening-related stuff. Before that, I can't wait for my mint to start growing!Excellent starting point for people looking to get started with gardening in containers and raised beds!",
