        "An inside view of Chinese academia and what it reveals about China’s political system",
        "On January 1, 2017, Daniel Bell was appointed dean of the School of Political Science and Public Administration at Shandong University―the first foreign dean of a political science faculty in mainland China’s history. In",
        "The Dean of Shandong",
        ", Bell chronicles his experiences as what he calls “a minor bureaucrat,” offering an inside account of the workings of Chinese academia and what they reveal about China’s political system. It wasn’t all smooth sailing―Bell wryly recounts sporadic bungles and misunderstandings―but Bell’s post as dean provides a unique vantage point on China today.Bell, neither a Chinese citizen nor a member of the Chinese Communist Party, was appointed as dean because of his scholarly work on Confucianism―but soon found himself coping with a variety of issues having little to do with scholarship or Confucius. These include the importance of hair color and the prevalence of hair-dyeing among university administrators, both male and female; Shandong’s drinking culture, with endless toasts at every shared meal; and some unintended consequences of an intensely competitive academic meritocracy. As dean, he also confronts weightier matters: the role at the university of the Party secretary, the national anticorruption campaign and its effect on academia (Bell asks provocatively, “What’s wrong with corruption?”), and formal and informal modes of censorship. Considering both the revival of Confucianism in China over the last three decades and what he calls “the Communist comeback” since 2008, Bell predicts that China’s political future is likely to be determined by both Confucianism and Communism."

        "Review",
        "\"Bell places the minutiae of academic administration in the context of China’s post-Cultural Revolution attempt to reinstate a ‘complex bureaucratic system informed by the ideal of political meritocracy.’ His depiction of this goal’s uneven achievement is enriched by anecdotes about censorship, corruption, the importance of seemingly frivolous aesthetic matters, Shandong’s drinking culture, and the occasionally comic failures of Chinese institutions to convey their aims abroad.\" ―",
        "New Yorker",
        "\"Fascinating insight into life in China from the perspective of a non-Chinese academic. Bell offers a frank assessment of the realities of being a scholar in China. . . . Highly recommended for anyone interested in academia in present-day China.\" ―",

        "\"An insightful memoir of the author’s time as an administrator at a Chinese university. . . .at times frank, perceptive and wryly amusing. . . .those like Bell who write about [China] with wit and insight, deserve to be listened to.\"",

        "“A leading interpreter of the Confucian tradition, Daniel Bell takes us into the citadel of contemporary Chinese higher education. Honest and wise, entertaining and witty, he tells the story of an illustrious scholarly life that began in French Canada and Oxford and led to the deanship at Shandong University, one of the most prestigious in China. The personal narrative sparkles, but Bell also analyzes with great clarity and insight the many challenges as well as promises facing China and Chinese intellectuals in the unfolding twenty-first century.”―",

        "“If you think a book about a ‘minor educational bureaucrat’ in provincial China must be dull, think again. This is a sparkling, compulsively readable book about how an Oxford-educated Canadian political scientist became the leading theorist of political Confucianism in China. Bell’s story is charming and filled with self-deprecating humor, but it is also remarkably courageous, given the current climate. It will leave you with a sense that you understand the Chinese and the Chinese system much better than you did before.”―",

Along the way he treats, with a light hand, the cultural and philosophical underpinnings of contemporary China. This is a book anyone interested in that country will enjoy.”―",

But even more important is his cosmopolitan and communitarian spirit, a compelling worldview that makes him a true bridge between East and West. The wisdom of this book―as with all of Bell’s writing―is both novel and universal.”―",
