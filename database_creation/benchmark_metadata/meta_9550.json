        "August 1864",
        "-- The nation is at war, Missouri languishes under martial law, and a once-peaceful river town throngs with soldiers, spies, and sedition. Caught in the middle is Becky Thatcher, a downtrodden, yet determined young woman who is desperate to protect her father from being hanged as a traitor. Her situation can’t get worse…until Tom Sawyer stumbles back into her life.",
        "Upon awakening from a head injury, Tom doesn't recall crucial facts about his mission as a spy, including the reason he set out for Becky’s house before he was attacked. His former childhood sweetheart has every right to despise him for jilting her seven years ago. Nevertheless, he vows to help her clear her father--if she will trust him. But his search for the truth draws them deeper into a sinister conspiracy involving shadowy assassins, unwitting accomplices, and relatives whose motives and alliances are uncertain.",
        "As their mutual passion reignites, Becky veers between her instinctive desire for Tom and the promise of security offered by his old nemesis, Alfred Temple, a Union captain who pressures her to marry him. When a series of explosive events culminate in an unexpected showdown, Tom languishes behind bars, her father lies in a cave, gravely ill, and Becky faces near-certain execution if she reveals a damning secret she has guarded all along, even from Tom.",

        "\"Tom Sawyer Returns delivers a Civil War era thriller worthy of its leading characters. Highly recommended!\" - Chanticleer Reviews",
        "Review excerpt:Set in a divided world rife with danger and history, E.E. Burke takes characters so close to the heart of Americana and gives them new life. Fans of Mark Twain's original work will appreciate the attention to detail and the care in which the story is crafted, paying homage to the original tales of Tom Sawyer and his wild adventures. But this continuation sees a deeper, more intimate portrait of Becky Thatcher - a girl grown into a woman, who's come into her own confidence and whose sharp mind sees her through many perilous situations. Both Becky and Tom have grown significantly since their childhood days, and Burke expertly takes two kids written nearly 150 years ago and turns them into adults whose life experiences have been shaped by the Civil War; two individuals who are fiercely independent, yet whose attitudes and opinions have been molded by the world they live in. They jump off the page as not simply characters, but as fully realized people. People with complexities, fears, and failures. Not only does",
        "Tom Sawyer Returns",
        "take the reader on an adventurous ride filled with plots and ploys, but it also provides a beautiful romance that blooms amidst the thorns of trouble. E.E. Burke writes with a balance of delicacy and sharpness, showing the true nature of love - that it is something tangled and complicated. As the reader follows Becky and Tom, they're never made to doubt the pair's attraction, but to instead find comfort knowing that while their combined history may complicate their feelings for each other, love will still prevail in end. As it always does, and as it always will continue to do.",
        "Publishers Weekly/Booklife Review",
        "Author of a dozen novels, Burke presents a triumphant romance-adventure amid Civil War strife in this engaging unofficial sequel to Mark Twain's classic. Seven years after Tom Sawyer abandoned Becky Thatcher, his childhood sweetheart, he stumbles back into her life. Now a spy, Tom finds her downtrodden yet plucky, determined to protect her father from arrest for treason. When an anonymous enemy frames her father, Becky and Tom set out to absolve him. But Becky's would-be betrothed, Union Captain Alfred Temple, interrupts, hellbent on marrying her against her will. As Becky and Tom's mutual passion rebounds, they discover a sinister war scheme and other surprises connected, as in Twain's work, to American life and its spirit. Burke proves adept at romantic tension as Tom and Becky alternately resist and bask in their attraction to one another. Tom embodies his nation's ideal hero: roguish, tender, and willing to surrender her love to Alfred if that guarantees her safety. Likewise, Becky's uncertainty about Tom's loyalty creates a delicious struggle against her instinctive desire. Due to a blow on the head, Tom is almost as uncertain as Becky; fighting to regain his memories throughout most of the novel. Touches of humor, such as when Becky persuades him to dress as a midwife to avoid soldiers' scrutiny, spark laughter. The resulting interplay between suspense and romance is polished in every way except for occasional missing punctuation. A self-described history geek, Burke is a Twain expert who based the story's central turmoil on Confederate conspiracies in Missouri. (Twain himself, of course, penned a pair of Tom Sawyer sequels, too.) Trips through a brothel, an Underground Railroad hideaway, and the innards of a steamboat offer vivid, well-researched settings. Invisible-ink messages smuggled by unwitting conspirators and heroes disguised as villains provide juicy twists. This swashbuckling adventure will win the hearts of Twain fans and period romance and adventure readers alike.",
        "Readers of historical adventures and romance will adore this exuberant sequel to Mark Twain's classic. Great for fans of Mark Twain, Sandra Merville Hart",
        "A Stranger on My Land",
        "From the Author",
        "From an early age, I've been afflicted with a fondness for two precocious Missouri-bred boys introduced to me by Mark Twain. As I read (and reread) Tom and Huck's adventures, I hated to bid them farewell at a point where their stories were just taking off. What happened to them when they grew up? Tom Sawyer Returns picks up more than a decade after we left him as a carefree lad in a sleepy town on the Mississippi River. It made sense that Tom would eventually leave to seek adventures. History provided a desperate event that would bring him home, determined to be a hero. Numerous incidents in this book are based on historic reports, one of which alludes to a shadowy conspiracy by Confederate sympathizers. Put Tom in the middle of a deadly scheme, having to solve a mystery without crucial memories, and you have an exciting plot. But a love story requires more.In Twain's book, the character of Becky Thatcher fits the traditional stereotype of the Victorian female: beautiful, helpless, idealized, and, quite frankly, boring. I wondered what a girl like that might do when faced with adversity if she were made of more than fluff? The Becky Thatcher who sprang to life onto these pages surprised me with her cleverness, compassion, courage and sense of adventure. She'd shown something of her spunk in choosing Tom in the first place. Seeing her develop into a multi-faceted, independent woman, was pure delight.",
