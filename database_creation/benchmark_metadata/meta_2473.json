        "If you are interested in reading a book that deals with many of the ills that are plaguing our society, then Whatever Happen To COMMON SENSE is your book. The Author Elmer Williams shoots from the hip on so many issues. He says things that most are thinking, but do not have the courage to say it. From the time you pick the book up, you will not want to stop reading it until you have finished the last chapter. From the beginning in chapter one the author deals with “Just Tell It Like It Is”. You will be captivated by his frankness and common sense approach. In chapter 7 and chapter 9 which are entitled “Raising Cain” and “Building Frankenstein”, he deals with rearing children. These chapters also give a reason on why our children are not growing up to be responsible. We all will be familiar with someone from “The Don’t Get It Crowd” in chapter ten. Chapter seventeen will touch on why so many men have been emasculated. It also discusses why the media is so adamant about portraying every homosexual as a perfect role model. Chapter eighteen “Race and Racism” and chapter nineteen ” Justice or Not” deals with racism and injustices in our society. Chapter twenty “History, Cronyism, Nepotism, and Affirmative Action” is sure to get many conversations started. Chapter twenty two “The Media Is To Blame” discusses the bias in the media and how they cover certain stories. The book is a call to get back to using common sense in schools, work environment, politics, and in our everyday lives. Common Sense is something that we all are born with, but often forget to use it. You could compare having common sense and not using this God given gift, to having a lifejacket aboard the Titanic, yet refusing to put it on. That’s what you will get from reading this book, a common sense methodology. Let’s get back to the basics and maybe we can start an outburst of common sense thinking. This book is thought provoking and insightful. Some readers maybe become angered by the boldness of the Author. However it will get many dialogs started. If you have an opinion you should at least back that opinion up with an objective reasoning to that particular belief. If you are not objective in your beliefs, you have been reduced to a child’s rationale of your belief system. In “What Ever Happen To Common Sense” your subjective beliefs will be challenged.Email: Whateverhappentocommonsense@yahoo.comWebsite:http://www.whateverhappentocommonsense.com"

        "About the Author",
        "I grew up with 2 brothers and one sister and my mother and father did not go to college. From an early age I always did not like people sugarcoating things when they gave me an answer. It got me in trouble sometimes but I was always content with who I was. I was always very stubborn and strong willed. I was not my mothers or fathers picked in the family. My mom was more bias to my older and younger brother, while my father showed partiality to my sister. I was the second child born to the family, and my father's first born. Early on it bothered me that I was not one of the favorites but it made me the person that I am today. I don't mind standing along on issues, and I don't mind speaking my mind when I feel that I am absolutely right. I like to get along with people but not at the expense of compromising my core beliefs. I liked to think that those core beliefs are grounded and rooted in truth. This is something that is challenged regularly if you are married. You must learn to have a balance which I am still learning after 17 years of marriage. When I first met my wife I knew that she was a strong willed person. She has made me more stubborn with that strong will that she has. We have 3 kids Ariah, Josiah, and Isaiah who have taught me patience.",
