        "Review",
        "“Marc Prensky’s understanding of how school-age digital natives learn underpins his prescient ‘pedagogy of partnering.’ He looks to the learner as the first consideration in the educational equation. The insightful advice and gentle guidance Marc provides classroom teachers directly assist them in moving powerful digital tools into the right hands…their students’! Marc’s understanding that the pedagogy of partnering is built on a relationship of co-learning is fundamental to the 21st-century classroom. This book looks to the future with an urgent spirit of possibility and promise!”",

        ", Marc Prensky redefines the whole problem of digitally savvy kids being taught by un-digitally-savvy teachers. Rather than bemoaning, as nearly everyone else has, what teachers do not know, he celebrates what they do know and what they can do. He shows how teachers and students together can pool knowledge and engage in collective intelligence to make both teachers and students―and society―smarter in the act.This book is a must-read for anyone interested in school reform and 21st-century learning.\"",

        "“Prensky takes the task of marshalling 21st-century technologies for classroom instruction to a practical level that teachers can both understand and apply immediately. The concept of partnering and allowing both teachers and students to capitalize on their strengths clarifies the issue for educators. The good news: teachers don’t have to be masters of technology to master the 21st-century classroom. Prensky has developed a new map for a new era of teaching and learning that educators will find a breeze to navigate, and well worth the trip!”",

        "“In",
        "Teaching Digital Natives",
        ", Prensky laments the fact that many educators today think students have short attention spans. He points out that although this may be true in the context of school, most students concentrate just fine on things that interest them. The book then explains to educators how to make school an interesting place for students with a partnering pedagogy.”",

        "is that the author has carefully defined and redefined the roles of teachers, learners, and parents with concrete examples and practical hints.

        "-- Lawrence L. Smith, PhD, Professor of Elementary Education Published On: 2012-07-23",
        "\"I would definitely use this book with Masters-level and doctoral students in teacher education to provoke them to think about teaching and learning in more critical and innovative ways. Reading Prensky’s book would be a catalyst for giving partnering, coaching, guiding, questioning, and facilitating versus telling more time in their classrooms. I hear many teachers say they want to be coaches and guides in their classrooms, but they don’t know how to do this. In this book, Prensky lays out ways they can accomplish this goal.\"Prensky’s book has the potential to impact both policy and practice in education, and it definitely provides a vision for the future regarding what 21st century teaching and learning should be like. Prensky offers a highly innovative, forward thinking, critical, and potentially transformative way of thinking about the connections between teaching and learning for 21st century students, our digital natives.\"",
