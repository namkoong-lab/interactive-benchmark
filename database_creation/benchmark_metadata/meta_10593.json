        "For his second ECM album Avishai Cohen presents a program which pust the focus on the ensemble, on teamwork, with a quartet of the highest calibre. The adroit, almost telepathic interplay among the musicians allows Cohen to soar, making it clear why he is one of the most talked-about jazz musicians on the contemporary scene. \"These people together are my dream team\", says the charismatic trumpeter of his fellow players, who share his sense for daring improvisation and his feeling for structure."
