        "When Seven Murphy-Collins lost his mother to a drug overdose, the world learned what a vengeful teenager was capable of. All he did was take on a drug ring, the police, and death to finally get his justice. But what will he do when his friends are taken from him? Along with an angry reaper, Senator Grey and the mysterious Purple Sashes join the hunt for Christine, the former thief that Seven saved while searching for his father. Throw in some desperate ex-cops and a hellian that seems to attract trouble for a crazy manhunt, filled with twists and turns to keep you guessing until the final page."
