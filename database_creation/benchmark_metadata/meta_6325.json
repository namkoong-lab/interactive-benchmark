        "Our Stiletto Shocks were created to give your bike the attitude and suspension travel that a proper corner-eating machine needs. The high performance damper is wrapped in a spring combination designed specifically to deal with subtle road noise and imperfections, while the main coil handles the big hits and controls bottoming. The result is a plush ride that's not afraid to play rough. Available in 13\" or 15\" for most Sportster models and 12. 5\" and 13. 5\" for Dyna models! We are looking to expand our applications to fit HD Touring models and Triumph Modern Classic models in the future."
