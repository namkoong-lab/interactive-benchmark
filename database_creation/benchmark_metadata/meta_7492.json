        "My book is a collection of original blues poetry and songs as is stated in the title. My poetry comes straight from my head and/or my heart. I do not sit down to write poetry. Ive tried to no avail. It comes to me when its ready, and I either write it down or it fades away. Just so you know, my dear and gentle reader, I am not Carl Sandberg nor Emily Dickinson. No need to be. We had one of each of them and it was good. I call myself primarily a blues poet, but theres more to my poetry and me than that. I can be blue, happy, angry, morbid, and more. Every time you think you have me pegged, Im going to throw you a curve. Im going to make you laugh. Im going to make you cry. I may even make you mad. Im going to make you think. Im going to get inside your head while you try to get inside mine."
