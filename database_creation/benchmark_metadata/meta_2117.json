        "Where Will You Spend Eternity?The drama of salvation involves every man, woman, and child on earth. In this life, all of us are suspended between heaven and hell.Few people understand what Jesus did or how it affects us.Worse yet, there are endless squabbles between Christians of different persuasions, leading to confusion on a massive scale.In this book, Jimmy Akin uses his expertise in Scripture and Church teaching to cut through the confusion and provide clear answers on important issues like:•What we need to do to be saved•Whether salvation is a one-time event or a process•Whether penance is part of God’s plan•What indulgences are•How faith and works relate •What the Church teaches about justification•How far apart Protestants and Catholics are on this question•Whether you have to be a Catholic (or a Christian) to be savedNo other book takes on these questions with the clarity and precision that Akin brings to them…and the answer will affect you and those you love . . . forever."

        "Review",
        "\"In his usual clear and precise style, Jimmy Akin wrestles with the topic of justification before God. Using Scripture and Sacred Tradition, Akin explains salvation for the scholar and the novice alike, distilling down all the perspectives to an understandable and clear-cut conclusion. This book should be in the hands of every person concerned with -- Steve Ray \"Author, Crossing the Tiber: Evangelical Protestants Discover the Historical Church\"\"Redemption is a beautiful and profound mystery, the fruit of true, authentic, and unmerited friendship with Jesus Christ. In The Drama of Salvation, Jimmy Akin explains Scripture and Catholic doctrine to reveal the divine love at the heart of our salvation. This book will be meaningful to anyone who desires to serve God in this life, and to be happy in heaven with him for eternity.\" -- The Most Reverend James Conley \"Bishop of Lincoln Nebraska\"\"The most important truths anyone could hope to know are those that pertain to what must we do to be saved. Jimmy Akin has written a fine book that carefully and clearly explores this topic using biblical, Patristic, and magisterial material. The Drama of Salvation is a very useful resource for those who wish to embrace the Church's call to evangelization. \" -- Ralph Martin \"President, Renewal Ministries\"",

        "About the Author",
        "Jimmy Akin was born in Texas and grew up nominally Protestant. At age 20 he experienced a profound conversion to Christ. Planning on becoming a Protestant pastor or seminary professor, Jimmy started an intensive study of the Bible, but the more he immersed himself in Scripture, the more he found it to support the Catholic faith. Eventually, he was compelled in conscience to enter the Catholic Church, which he did in 1992. His conversion story, \"A Triumph and a Tragedy,\" is published in the book Surprised By Truth. Akin is a Senior Apologist at Catholic Answers, a member on the Catholic Answers Speakers Bureau, a weekly guest on the global radio program, Catholic Answers Live, a contributing editor for Catholic Answers Magazine, and the author of numerous publications, including the books Mass Confusion, The Salvation Controversy, The Fathers Know Best, Mass Revision, and newly released The Drama of Salvation.",
