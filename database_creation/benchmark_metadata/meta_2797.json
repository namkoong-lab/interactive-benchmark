        "gathers the best of Branch’s work for the first time, featuring 20 of his favorites from the more than 2,000 pieces he has published in the paper.",
        "Branch is renowned for covering the offbeat in the sporting world, from alligator hunting to wingsuit flying.",
        "Sidecountry",
        "features such classic Branch pieces, including “Snow Fall,” about downhill skiers caught in an avalanche in Washington state, and “Dawn Wall,” about rock climbers trying to scale Yosemite’s famed El Capitan. In other articles, Branch introduces people whose dedication and decency transcend their sporting lives, including a revered football coach rebuilding his tornado-devastated town in Iowa and a girls’ basketball team in Tennessee that plays on despite never winning a game. The book culminates with his moving personal pieces, including “Children of the Cube,” about the surprising drama of Rubik’s Cube competitions as seen through the eyes of Branch’s own sports-hating son, and “The Girl in the No. 8 Jersey,” about a mother killed in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting whose daughter happens to play on Branch’s daughter’s soccer team.",
        "John Branch has been hailed for writing “American portraiture at its best” (Susan Orlean) and for covering sports “the way Lyle Lovett writes country music—a fresh turn on a time-honored pleasure” (Nicholas Dawidoff).",
        "Sidecountry",
        "is the work of a master reporter at the top of his game."

The latest is \"Sidecountry: Tales of Death and Life from the Back Roads of Sports,\" a compilation of more than 20 stories that have special meaning to me. They are intimate adventure stories involving ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances -- sometimes death-defying, occasionally heartbreaking, always life-affirming. A couple of them are personal. According to a starred review in Publisher\\'s Weekly, \"Branch delivers consistently smart, startling observations—and offers something for every reader, whether or not they’d consider themselves sports fans.”', 'I have covered all the big sports and all the big events. These days, I\\'m a reporter without a beat, writing a little bit of everything, from the Olympics (many times) to dog-grooming contests (once). I usually nibble in the shadows of the sports world. My goal is to surprise readers, to give them memorable stories that they did not know they needed. \"Sidecountry\" is filled with them -- stories of men making the world\\'s hardest rock climb, of girls at a reform school playing for a basketball team that never wins, of families waiting for the bodies of their loved ones to be recovered from the slopes of Mt. Everest, even of kids (including my own) finding their place in the world of competitive speed cubing.', 'I received the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for \"Snow Fall,\" a story about a deadly avalanche in Washington, and was a finalist for the prize the year before for a series about hockey enforcer Derek Boogaard, the subject of my first book, \"Boy on Ice: The Life and Death of Derek Boogaard\" (W.W. Norton, 2014), which became a New York Times bestseller and the winner of the ESPN/Pen Award for Literary Sports Writing.', '\"The Last Cowboys\" (W.W. Norton, 2018) is about a rodeo and ranching family struggling to build a future using old ways in the New West. Susan Orlean called it \"American portraiture at its best.\"', \"Born in California, raised in Golden, Colo., and a one-time manager for Costco, I received a Master's degree in Journalism from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1996. I worked for The Gazette in Colorado Springs for several years, then became the sports columnist at the Fresno Bee before being hired by The New York Times in 2005.
