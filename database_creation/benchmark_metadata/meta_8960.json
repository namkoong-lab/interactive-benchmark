        "Review",
        "\"The expectation on 'what to follow' is set on the first page with the box \"You will be able to . . .\" and the rest of the chapters are very well structured according to these aims. The structure, as well as the central theoretical arguments in each chapter, develop very logically and the coherence of each chapter is maintained very well.\"\"Overall, this book fulfills a need of our time and highly recommended for all stakeholders.\"\"This will be an important textbook . . . I would select this for the required textbook for courses I teach.\"\"This publication is long overdue! Oliver Laasch and Roger Conaway have taken a giant stride towards realizing responsible management. Their approach leads us to believe that we have almost achieved that goal. However, it is time for fundamental change in the choice of materials and production processes. Let's be creative, innovative and beneficial for environment and society. Merely being responsible is boring!\"\"Principles of Responsible Management is the book that many of us have been waiting for--a remarkable tour de force that integrates responsible management with all of the key disciplines involved in successfully managing the modern enterprise. Its comprehensive coverage and timely emphasis on the responsibilities inherent in each of the management functions, combined with both a global (actually, 'glocal') and historical perspective on how these functions fit together, make it an invaluable classroom and managerial resource for anyone interested in managing for a better future.\"",
