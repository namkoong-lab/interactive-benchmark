        "About the Author",
        "An author, single mother, journalist, madam and sexpert, Samantha X is a modern day woman who is dedicated to empowering other women. Samantha X grew up in London, where she attended an elite private school. She comes from a middle class educated and conservative background. No stranger to controversy, Samantha launched her career as a young, bright-eyed reporter; having started as a young gun on London's tabloid press, chasing celebrities and writing salacious stories. In the year 2000, she decided to give up London life for sun and sea and set up home in Sydney. There, she spent 10 happy years writing for Australia's top magazines and notched a few top jobs on her resume, from news editor at New Idea magazine to beauty director on the prestigious fashion title InStyle; as well as freelance producer on Seven's Today Tonight. Samantha appeared as the regular beauty expert on Seven's The Morning Show. After her relationship breakdown and a few failed relationships, Samantha decided to dip her toe into what she felt was an empowering industry, and became a high-class escort. She firmly believes it is a far more ethical and kinder career than that of a hard-nosed reporter. In September 2014, Samantha went public and released her first book Hooked: Secrets of a High Class Escort. Her controversial story made global headlines and she was invited to LA and London to appear on various talk shows, as well as becoming a popular voice in Australian press. While some attacked her for job choice, she soon became an inspiration for women and men worldwide wanting to know her secrets in and out of the bedroom. In 2015, Samantha started Samantha X Angels, a high-class escort agency. She now lives by the beach with her two children and two dogs.",
