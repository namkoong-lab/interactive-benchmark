        "Three talented sisters claw their way from the Harlem ghetto to stardom in the rock 'n' world of the 1950s, a world of fame, music and Sparkle. But even though they escape the ghetto, the sisters cannot escape its problems, and their dream of celebrity and success becomes a nightmare of jealousy and drugs in this powerful tale.",

And as the much put-upon Sister, McKee is convincing and earns the viewer's sympathy. Set in the 1950's, the movie tackles racism, sexism, jealousy, and both chemical and physical abuse.
