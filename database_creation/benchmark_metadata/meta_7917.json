        "by Ann P. Borrmann stand out is a unique incorporation of fantasy characters and poetry. Borrmann starts with an excellent poem about theTwinkles. I would reread this just for that poem. It is a delightful rhyme advising how to meet the reclusive, tea-drinking creatures.... I like the choice not to show the Twinkles. I'm curious to know what they look like, but having an unknown fantasy creature pushes thereader's imagination.",

        "--- GINA RAE MITCHELL REVIEWS \"First of all, I found The Jolly Bupbup quite refreshing. It wasn't about what I expected. Furthermore, the language was playful and unfamiliar. I don't know what \"bupbup\" or \"jelly middles\" are but they are cute andkept me wanting to read along. I think the illustrations fit the storyperfectly. I could see this book being a favorite of one of my nieces or nephews. I would recommend it for toddlers to preschool-age children.The story is not too complicated but would be engaging for a little one. Even I was wondering what would happen next. The book includes a little poem at the beginning that would be nice for an early childhoodclassroom. The book is a stand-alone story but I think it could easilyturn into a series. Ann P. Borrmann does a good job at picking up onsome peculiar details while leaving other details unexplained to keepthe young reader wondering what will happen next.\"   ---REVIEWED BY JAMIE LEE WANDEL FOR READER'S FAVORITE",
