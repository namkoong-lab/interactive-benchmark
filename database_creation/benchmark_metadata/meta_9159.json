        "While not the first biography written about environmentalist Aldo Leopold (see Curt Meine's Aldo Leopold: His Life & Work, Univ. of Wisconsin, 1988), this one is definitely a worthwhile addition to the literature. Sufficient facts and context are provided to leave the reader informed yet not overburdened with detail. Environmental writer Lorbiecki does not offer much interpretation of events but rather allows us to see Leopold's development through description of his life and his own philosophical evolution. We see his emergence as a leader in wilderness preservation, and game and then wildlife management. We also see his development as a husband, father, and mentor. The presentation of Leopold's public and private lives is well balanced. He is portrayed here not as a saint but as a thinking man, willing to learn and change. Those unfamiliar with Leopold will relish this book; those who already know him will enjoy the retelling. This highly readable, lavishly illustrated biography is recommended for all environmental collections, public and academic.?Nancy J. Moeckel, Miami Univ.

        "This beautifully written biography tells the life story of the foremost American conservationist in this century. Born in 1887 and educated at Yale, Aldo Leopold worked throughout his life ¿ whether for the Forest Service or as a naturalist, educator, and writer ¿ to articulate an American land ethic: \"How can we live on the land without spoiling it?\" In this heavily illustrated biography, Marybeth Lorbiecki movingly reveals the background, early inspirations, struggles, and triumphs of the author of the environmental classics, A Sand County Almanac and Round River."
