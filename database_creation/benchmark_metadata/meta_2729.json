        "Cecelia wasn't sure how to feel about being assigned as a student teacher to the high school she'd left behind four years ago. Things got more tense when she found out that her supervising teacher would be Bob Hawkins - the man she'd had a crush on during her senior year of high school. When she saw him, it all came rushing back, emotions that were unwelcome because they made her feel like she was a kid again.What she didn't know was that he'd had feelings for her back then too, and had suppressed them as the inappropriate emotions they were. And when he saw her ... all grown up ... it all came rushing back to him too.Now both of them are trying to fight the attraction.And both are fighting a losing battle.Warning: Described by some as \"A man's romance novel\" the author feels that a complete romance novel includes detailed descriptions of the physical relationships adults engage in. This book deals with adult issues and contains both language and scenes that are inappropriate for those under the age of eighteen."

Cone Books has stolen at least four of Robert's books and re-published them for sale. Cone Books does NOT have permission to do this. If you see the name Robert Lubrican on the cover of a Cone Book, do not be fooled. It's true that the book was written by Robert, but you are looking at a copyright violation that amounts to fraud.\", 'Robert Lubrican began writing erotica in roughly 2003, but didn\\'t decide to publish any of it until 2005. That year he won the Golden Clitoride award for best new author. He started out writing short stories, commonly called \"stroke stories.\" But the readers asked for more, so the stories got longer ... and longer ... and longer ... until they turned into full fledged novels. He is known for a number of things. He\\'s fascinated with pregnancy, and thinks the most beautiful woman in the world is a pregnant one, so there\\'s a lot of that in his writing. He believes that, for sex to be meaningful, it must be based on love, rather than lust. He likes happy endings. He creates characters we want to get to know, and maybe sit and have a beer with. When asked about his plots, he answered \"My favorite thing in the world is to take a plot that\\'s unlikely, or maybe even impossible, and then create characters who are so interesting they distract the reader from that fact.\" His books are most often described as books with a good plot and some sex in them, as opposed to books about sex. And that is because Bob recognizes that sex is an important part of everyone\\'s life, whether it\\'s good sex or not. And so it just seems logical that sex should be part of each character\\'s life as well.', \"Bob's writing benefits from many things, including a 21 year career in law enforcement, his time spent in the Army, the fact that he's lived in four different countries, and his general renaissance man attitude about life.\", 'You may reach the author with your comments, if so desired, at merely.bob@gmail.com']}"
