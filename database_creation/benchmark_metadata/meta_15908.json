        "H. G. Spafford was a successful lawyer and real estate investor in Chicago in the 1860s. He suffered great losses in the Great Fire of 1871. A couple years later, his family was planning a family vacation to Europe but he got held up with business so he sent his wife and four daughters (2-11) ahead. Their ship wrecked and all four daughters died. When his wife arrived in Europe, she cabled him \"Saved alone. What shall I do?\" He went to Europe to bring back his wife, and the captain told him when he was passing near the spot where the ship (the SS Ville du Havre) had gone down. The story goes that he received the inspiration for the song there, although it was likely written or at least completed a couple years later.",
        "Psalm 62:5 says \"My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.\" Despite what we go through in life, we can still have assurance that \"it is well with my soul\".",
        "This design is available in a number of colors. Our Unisex Tees are available from S-5X, and are a generous cut."
