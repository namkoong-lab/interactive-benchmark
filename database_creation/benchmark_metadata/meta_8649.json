        "In coaching vernacular, a relationship guy is someone who performs at their peak when they have meaningful relationships and bonds with the coaches they work with every day. In reality, this concept is not exclusive to athletics. All people have an inherent desire to be close to others. We are all relationship guys. Brian Polian has been coaching college football at the highest levels for over 20 plus years. He has traveled the country recruiting elite student-athletes and working with them on a daily basis in the highly competitive and pressure-filled world of college athletics. In that time, he has witnessed a dramatic shift in how best to effectively teach and develop young people. Generation Z is different from their predecessors and the failure to recognize that and to adjust will put any person that works with them at a disadvantage. In order to effectively teach or coach Generation Z, establishing and maintaining healthy relationships with them must be the first priority. We have to honor the relationship before we can honor the task. Coach Polian draws upon his experiences and reflects on relationships being the greatest rewards in life, why they are so important to young people, identifying the building blocks of relationships, and how to build better ones with Generation Z. He examines honestly on the dynamics of diversity in working with today s student-athletes. The book also provides simple but effective ways to guide the giving and receiving of feedback and reminders of some of the characteristics that make Generation Z so unique. Finally, some of his mentors and valued peers from across the coaching profession share their observations as to the importance of building relationships with students and athletes. This book is not just for members of the coaching community. It can serve as a resource for teachers, employers, and even parents; for anyone that works to help young people develop and grow."

        "Review",
        "Brian Polian has grown up around football. As a young man, he saw it coached at the highest level in the NFL, and he has had a very successful coaching career himself for over 20 years. Being around so many excellent coaches have allowed Brian to understand that coaching starts with relationships. In this book, Coaching and Teaching Generation Z, he gives a great outline of how to successfully build relationships by fostering communication that is built on trust, respect, and love. This book will help anyone who is interested in leading a team, a business, or a family. --Tony Dungy: Superbowl Champion, Pro Football Hall of Fame Coach, Author and NBC Sports AnalystBrian grew up around the game of football and wanted to coach since he was 14 years old. In this unique book, he makes a real contribution to the game and profession he loves so much. --Bill Polian: Former NFL Executive, Super Bowl Champion, and Member of the Pro Football Hall of FameAs a former college athlete and also the parent of three children who were recruits, I have a unique perspective when it comes to the relationships between coaches and players. Having known Brian Polian since 2007 and observed his work with my own sons, I can tell you he practices what he preaches. There is great value in his thoughts on relating to Generation Z. I would not only recommend this book for coaches, but also for anyone working with this generation of young people. --Mike Golic: Former NFL Player and Current ESPN Analyst",
