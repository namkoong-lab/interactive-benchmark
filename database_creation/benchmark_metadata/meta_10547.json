        "Foxes is 22 year old Louisa Rose Allen. Following early releases on hugely respected pop label Neon Gold, Foxes was name-checked as one to watch by global megastar Katy Perry. Foxes single Youth was the song that caught the ear of Lady Gaga-collaborator Zedd culminating in the his platinum selling hit song Clarity ft Foxes, which has soundtracked summer 2013 in America. Other successes came with UK production gurus Rudimental on the co-written Right Here and the song Just One Yesterday on the recent Fall Out Boy US No1 album. Glorious is Foxes debut album."
