Erick Eisenberg takes on challenging positions, writes in a cogent and accessible manner, and always stimulates new scholarship . . . This work will be an important teaching tool, not just for the innovative content of the writing, but also for the historical narrative of organizational communication embedded in it . . . This collection of essays represents a body of work that provides the foundation for our emerging understanding of the relationship between communication, organization, and identity. Its legacy should prompt us to rethink the opportunities and challenges of communication in our increasingly complex world. The world that Eric Eisenberg envisions- and that he has encouraged us to create- is one that draws on ambiguity as a means to support both personal and social transformation. He gives us communication tools for living in a world that calls forth self-reflection, respect, contingency, dialogue, and peace.\"",
