        "Real virgins say, “Yes!” (In Mexico, they say “Sí!”)With that answer, Susan Cobb commits to remodeling a house on the coast of Mexico—and refurbishing her life along with it. Virgin Territory will transport you to the rural lushness of Mexico’s Pacific Coast, a region bursting with today’s promise while still being deeply grounded in the past. As she puts down new roots in an ancient land, Cobb reshapes her perspective and reclaims her own sense of self. The Virgin of Guadalupe, along with a variety of indigenous goddesses and modern feminine icons, add a rich tapestry of focus, folklore, and color to her journey’s landscape.Virgin Territory: How I Found My Inner Guadalupe is written in the spirit of Under the Tuscan Sun and A Year in Provence, but with the soul and humor of Anne Lamott. It is an essential read for those with a love for Mexico and a longing to see themselves “clothed with the sun.” Praise for Virgin Territory:“Virgin Territory is a charming, thoughtful, and wonderful journey, bringing to light an idea that is timely and riveting.” —Lynne Bundesen, author of So the Woman Went Her Way and The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture“An intensely personal, often humorous, adventure into a feminine landscape, into the heart of Mexico and of Guadalupe herself. Cobb becomes a pioneer for everywoman as she finds the source of her inner strength, rebellion, and healing, her own ‘inner Mary.’” —Becky Kemery, author of Yurts: Living in the Round“Like reading a coming of age story for mature adults. Truly a fascinating read. The author weaves tales of the Virgin in many different forms into her own personal history.” —Kay Lindahl, author of The Sacred Art of Listening and founder of The Listening Center"

Cobb found the love of her life in the parking lot of the Christian Science Church in Lubbock, Texas. While hippies danced in the mud at Woodstock, she walked down a bridal aisle dressed in virginal white. She was a \"very good girl.\" She is much older and more experienced these days, maybe not so good, but definitely BETTER. Still exploring that virginity thing -- the quality of being undefined by any human relationship, one-in-herself, un-captured, un-broken, triumphant, whole and intact.', 'A full-time steeped-in-the-culture resident of Mexico, Susan divides her time between the Nayarit coast and San Miguel de Allende. She is currently at work on another personal memoir, this one infused, not with the Virgin of Guadalupe, but with Mary Baker Eddy. \"Perhaps,\" she says, \"if Sandra Cisneros can refer to herself as a Budda-lupista, I can be a Guada-cientista!\"']}"
