        "for grades 3-5 offers teachers everything they need to create a student-centered learning environment based on choice. This book provides five different types of menus that students can use to select exciting products that they will develop so teachers can assess what has been learned―instead of using a traditional worksheet format. Topics addressed include whole numbers and operations, fractions, probability and statistics, geometry, and measurement.",
        "Differentiating Instruction With Menus for the Inclusive Classroom: Math",
        "provides numerous types of leveled menus that lower and on-level elementary-aged students can use to demonstrate learning through a method of their choice. Menus with similar formats but geared towards varying ability levels allow teachers to differentiate easily. Using the creative and challenging choices found in Tic-Tac-Toe menus, List menus, 2-5-8 menus, Three Shape menus, and Baseball menus, students will look forward to sharing their newfound knowledge throughout the year. Also included are specific guidelines for products, rubrics for assessing student products, and teacher introduction pages for each menu. This is a must-have for any teacher wanting to differentiate for a wide range of learners!Grades 3-5"

        "Review",
        "This publication for grades 3-5 is designed to address the needs of a classroom that includes special needs or limited English-proficient students. The activities included on the menus are engaging and appropriate. Most of the menus contain wide-ranging choices, with some options involving art, technology, drama, and experiments. In addition, many activities contain real-world applications. ,Jennifer Orr,Teaching Children Mathematics, 2/1/14",

After being in the classroom for over 15 years, I was asked if I would consider leaving my \"children\" (students) and instead work with teachers sharing the ideas which I had found so helpful in my classroom. Like many other teachers, I had so many different abilities in my classroom as well as students whose strengths did not always center around their abilities.', 'I first developed choice boards in 1990 when I started teaching internationally. The needs of my students were so diverse from ability to language proficiency that I had to find a technique that could be a \"strategic superhero\" to save the situation. Menus saved the day; they met the needs of all of my students. Even after returning to the United States to teach, I continued to integrate them into instruction until I left the classroom.', 'I did not agree to leave the classroom to escape, but rather with the goal that by writing books and presenting staff development for teachers, I could have an even greater on students by providing some solutions for teachers. No matter what the job title, I am a teacher first and foremost.']}"
