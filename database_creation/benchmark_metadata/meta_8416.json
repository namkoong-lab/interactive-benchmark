        "The Bay Area is home to multiple popular franchises in all four major sports—the 49ers and Raiders (NFL), Giants and As (MLB), Kings and Warriors (NBA), and Sharks (NHL). With such diversity in rooting interest, area fans have much to debate all year long, and prominent Bay Area sports-radio host Damon Bruce is just the man to get the debate going with this entertaining book of original sports and entertainment lists. Bruce also enlists the help of such notable local stars to contribute their own lists, including Orlando Cepeda, Brent Jones, Gary Radnich, Drew Remeda, Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead, and more."
