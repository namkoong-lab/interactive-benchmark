        "Review",
        "This week we got Linda Hueftlein & Charlie's Book: Through Charlie's Eyes. This is my son who is 12, the book was perfect for him to better appreciate what all his pets have & develop empathy for those who have been injured or abused. Such a gentle book, the poem at the end broke my heart as my son read it to us. This book should be taken to children in hospitals that might relate to Charlies story, along with some companion dogs of course. Charlie is so special thank you Linda for sharing his world with us. Kisses to CharlieLinda...Thanks so much for writing such a beautiful story of Charlie's journey. Charlie's book came today!! I love it!Charlie and Mom Linda....just had to let you know that I received my copies of \"Through Charlie's Eyes\" today!!! This wonderful tribute to our little man Charlie is everything (and much more!!) that I thought it would be. I must admit that I actually shed tears as I read this book...Happy Thanksgiving to you, Charlie, and your family. We are spending today reading our Charlie book that came in yesterday's mail. Love it!",
