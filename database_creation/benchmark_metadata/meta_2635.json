        "About the Author",
        "Mark Kimmel has spoken at international forums, been a guest on radio and television shows, and has conducted workshops based on his unique insights into the transformation of Earth and her humans. Mark's books, \"Trillion,\" \"Decimal,\" \"One,\" \"Birthing A New Civilization,\" and \"Transformation,\" contain messages from off-planet sources such as the Andromedans and celestials. His new book, Chrysalis, is being written in conjunction with the Archangels. By focusing on both extraterrestrials and Archangels in his writing and speaking, Mark weaves a credible picture of the larger reality while presenting an uplifting vision for the future of mankind and of our planet. Mark avoids the sensational and fear-riddled perspectives that plague many who deal with the ET phenomena, and the secrecy and misinformation surrounding it, while presenting insights about Archangels without a religious orientation. Mark moved to his current passion from a successful business career where he had worked for major corporations, then founded and ran three of the most respected Colorado venture capital funds. In addition to providing capital, Mark served on portfolio companies' boards and helped them with strategy and tactics. He retired from business in 1996 to pursue his quest into the larger aspects of our existence. Mark has been listed in Who's Who since 1985. He has degrees in engineering, marketing, finance, psychology, and divinity. Mark is married with two grown sons and four grandchildren. He spends his days writing and speaking about this, the pivotal juncture in human history, and how each person has the power to make this metamorphic transformation positive for all on this planet. He is the founder of the Cosmic Paradigm Network, an international group dedicated to manifesting such a transformation.
