        "About the Author",
        "My name is Roxanne Capaul, I reside in Boulder CO.",
        "My background is Graphic Art, and Fine Art. I did all of the original drawings of Snakey Jake, I then gave the interior illustrations to Anne Whiting to paint. I designed the Book, and also a Plush toy that is available (Snakey Jake Toy). My strong graphics background has allowed me the flexibility to create additional pieces. Snakey Jake bookmarks, and a Snakey Jake Growth Chart. I will be adding several other items to this product line in the near future. I have won several design awards in Seattle, WA, where I was an Art Director for 11 years. I now am focused on writing children's books and creating new characters and toys, etc."
