        "In a fresh and funny companion to the Theodor Seuss Geisel Award winner, the fox sisters team up with their friend Eugene in three spy-rific adventures.",
        "After Zelda, Ivy, and their best friend Eugene watch the new Secret Agent Fox movie (some more bravely than others), they are inspired to do a little detective work themselves. With top-secret agent names chosen and notebook in hand, they’re ready to get to the bottom of neighborhood mysteries. But when a rainstorm threatens to ruin the agents’ campout, can the three foxy friends come up with an undercover alternative? Sly humor, lively illustrations, and a genuine eye for the everyday dynamics among siblings make this a perfect choice for beginning readers, whether old fans or new."

She turned to children’s writing in mid life, and is best known for her series of “Zelda and Ivy” books featuring two fox sisters, the older and bossy Zelda, and her adoring younger sibling, Ivy. The series drew critical praise and fan loyalty for its fresh take on sibling rivalry. Kvasnosky’s honors include dual Golden Kite Honors Awards in 1999 from the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI), and the American Library Association’s 2007 Theodor Seuss Geisel Award for “Zelda and Ivy: The Runaways” as America’s most distinguished book for beginning readers published that year. Her latest book, \"Little Wolf\\'s First Howling\", the story of a wolf pup who can\\'t help singing his own song, arrived in 2017 to further acclaim, winning the Margaret Wise Brown Honor Book Award for children\\'s literature text, as well as numerous starred reviews and \"best of the year\\'s books\" honors.']}"
