        "Product Description:",
        "Porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis and the relative group aereus, pinicola, reticulatus) are a key ingredient in traditional Italian cooking. They are the king of wild mushrooms with their intense aroma and unmistakable taste. Dried porcini mushrooms add a meaty richness and an earthy note to all kinds of dishes, perfect for flavoring risottos, sauces and condiments, savory meat dishes, and elegant vegetable sides.",
        "Cooking Instruction:",
        "Product must be rehydrated and cooked before eating. Rinse the mushrooms gently in cool water, and then soak them in warm water for 20 minutes before using. Once they have softened, they are ready to be used in your recipes. For the best yield from your mushrooms, we recommend keeping the soaking water, carefully filtered through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer, and adding it back during cooking.",
        "Instructions for Storage:",
        "To store correctly, keep in a cool, dry place. Avoid humidity and direct sunlight. Once the package is open, place the mushrooms in a hermetically sealed container. For longer periods of time, store the mushrooms in the freezer.",
        "One good thing about Dried Porcini Mushrooms is their shelf life. Because they have been dehydrated, you don't have to worry about them going bad quickly as you might with fresh mushrooms. Dried Porcini Mushrooms can also be rehydrated, which restores their former fresh texture. This allows the ingredient to be very versatile, which is why these mushrooms are used in many types of Italian recipes.",
