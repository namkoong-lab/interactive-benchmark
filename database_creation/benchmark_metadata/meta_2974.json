        "This is your notification. Humanity is out of touch. And the touch screen is to blame. Ironic, isn't it? Every digital process, each social media exchange, takes us three steps forward and two steps back in connectivity. We're inundated by an almost infinite number of systems, sensors, and syncs. It won't be long before our minds won't decode VR (Virtual Reality) from RL (Real Life). Our brains have been hacked, rewired toward the artificial. We are logging-off mankind to enjoy man made. And, now, we face an identity crisis. How exactly are we to be in the world without being of the World Wide Web? Hacked Minds challenges the reader to unplug from the matrix of cyberspace so we can understand what it is to be human again."

        "\"In an engaging and thought-provoking manner, Jorge Rudko succinctly reviews and analyzes features and trends of our modern digital age.\" \"His particular strength is to pinpoint, in just a few words, the issues we face, challenging some of our assumptions and alerting us to how our privacy is at risk.\" \"He helpfully guides us with commonsense strategies and practices as we endeavor to harness the best of digital power and still avoid the pitfalls associated with it.\" \"Read and think about these nine chapters--you will be glad you did--and be sure to share this book with others!\" -Jim Holmes \"We live in exciting times, in an unparalleled digital age that promises so many advances to society and individuals. However, have we paused to consider the downside, even dangers, inherent within the coming digital utopia?\" \"Jorge Rudko does us an immense service in issuing a direct and chilling caution about potentially losing our spiritual and mental freedom. Disregard this challenge at your own peril.\" -Carl Dobrowolski \"I highly recommend that everyone in some type of leadership position, needs to urgently read this book. If you want to be effective with the people you lead, you must be aware of an epidemic that will challenge your vision and affect the impact you have on others.\" -Sam Rodriguez \"A logical interpretation of the past A sobering appraisal of the present A dire vision of the trajectory of technology A prescription to \"unplug\"\" \"If you have ever experienced a family gathering in which all sat quietly looking at their electronic devices, this is a book that you need to read. My thanks to Mr. Rudko for his compelling insights!\" -Michael Ruhlen \"Groundbreaking perspective on our relationship to technology-how it is changing our lives, our brains, and our privacy. This book is a wake-up call.\" -Anne Geary Jorge Rudko's Hacked Minds-a critique of today's overuse of technological devices is a must read for all people; business leaders utilizing technologies to manage assets including associates, entrepreneurs accessing data in search of their next venture, parents raising tweens and teens, educators charged with shaping young minds and students who cannot separate from their multiple devices. First-time author, Jorge Rudko displays the literary skills of a seasoned writer. Jorge's conversational style of writing, along with his use of eloquent prose keeps the subject matter interesting-even for those of us who are not techies. Jorge calls upon great thinkers like Albert Einstein to help support his assertions; and he offers practical, implantable solutions that we all can use to reconnect with each other and ourselves. I found Hacked Minds to be insightful and meaningful reading-a useful book for anyone who owns so much as a smart phone, desktop, laptop or tablet. -John Pace",
