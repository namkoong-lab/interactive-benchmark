    "description": [
        "The wireless CHERRY 2310 2.0 mouse works with an optical sensor that can be adjusted in 3 stages. The DPI switch on the top of the mouse allows you to select the preferred resolution at the touch of a button. An LED provides information about the set DPI. Thanks to its technical concept, this computer mouse - the successor to the legendary CHERRY MW 2310 - is particularly energy-saving. With the supplied batteries (2 x AA), you can use the mouse for up to 3 years without changing batteries. If you do not use the mouse, you can switch it off with the on/off switch on the underside. The PC mouse gets its noble touch by the chrome-plated scroll wheel with non-slip rubber coating. By the way: The Nano USB receiver can remain permanently plugged into the notebook or laptop and ensures that the wireless mouse is always ready for use. Convince yourself of this high-quality and well-thought-out computer mouse!"
