This baby bottle prep accessory lets you make a bottle with just one hand while you hold and soothe your baby. To use the bökee, simply place the bökee on a hard, smooth and dry surface like your kitchen countertop. Press down firmly to enable the strong suction. Place your bottle inside and apply gentle pressure while twisting. The bökee's suction will hold your bottle in place so it can be opened, filled and closed with just one hand and no frustration. Avoid tipping or spilling when transferring breastmilk from milk storage bags or hold the bottle steady while you mix formula. The sleek and modern design of this bottle holder for baby will blend with your home décor, so there’s no need to hide it away. The small footprint won’t take up too much counterspace, making this an ideal baby bottle storage and prep tool for small spaces. Keep it right next to your bottle drying rack! For families with older kids, use the bökee to prepare a sippy cup while you hold little brother or sister. Ideal for wide mouth bottles such as Evenflo, Dr. Brown’s, Nuc and MAM. Made of food grade silicone, the bökee is BPA-free, lead-free and phthalates-free and dishwasher safe on the top rack for easy cleaning. A smart solution that allows you to prep bottles and sippy cups with one hand."
