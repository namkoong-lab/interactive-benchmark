        "The last thing zaftig middle-aged journalist, Rhoda Ginsburg, expected when she signed up for JDate was to fall in love with a vampire. But when she meets drop-dead gorgeous Sheldon, a Hasidic vampire, she falls hard. She rationalizes that he may not be alive, but at least he’s Jewish. She learns that back in the nineteenth century Sheldon was a rabbi who was turned into a vampire by Count Dracula, an anti-Semite who got his kicks from turning Orthodox Jews into vampires because then they’d have to drink blood, which isn’t kosher. Soon after she meets Sheldon, she discovers her beloved mother, Fanny, is terminally ill, so she comes up with the crackpot idea of getting Sheldon to turn Fanny and her friends, known as “the goils,” into vampires. Once she becomes a vampire, Fanny tires of her boring life in Century Village, Florida, and, seeking thrills, she goes clubbing and disappears into the nightlife of South Beach in Miami. When Fanny and her goil posse “go rogue” and start preying on the young, Rhoda and Sheldon must track them down to keep them from killing again. Interview with a Jewish Vampire turns vampire lore on its head, proving that not all vampires are young and beautiful and it IS possible to be undead and kosher. “Erica Manfred's wry humor is the perfect match for the sexy-vampire genre in this novel about the emotional intricacies of dating a hot Jewish guy who is a card-carrying member of the undead. Delicious!\" --Nancy Peske, coauthor of the bestselling Cinematherapy series, “Bloodaholics! And PETA! Clever, clever, clever!” --Avigayil Lansmann, contributor of The Meta Arts Magazine\"With wild irreverent humor, Erica Manfred's Interview With a Jewish Vampire turns upside down and sideways all the vampire cliches and stock images. Jewish vampires keeping kosher, old lady vampires on the prowl--this book is above all fun! ---Rachel C. Pollack, author of Arthur C. Clarke science fiction award winner Unquenchable Fire and World Fantasy Award Winner Godmother Night."

        "Erica Manfred's wry humor is the perfect match for the sexy-vampire genre in this novel about the emotional intricacies of dating a hot Jewish guy who is a card-carrying member of the undead. Delicious!\"--Nancy Peske, coauthor of the bestselling Cinematherapy series,\"Bloodaholics!  And PETA!  Clever, clever, -clever.\"--Avigayil Lansmann,  contributor to The Meta Arts Magazine.With wild irreverent humor, Erica Manfred's  Interview With a Jewish Vampire turns upside down and sideways all the vampire cliches and stock images.  Jewish vampires keeping kosher, old lady vampires on the prowl--this book is above all fun!--Rachel Pollack, author of  Arthur C. Clarke Science Fiction Award winner Unquenchable Fire, and World Fantasy Award winner Godmother Night“Filled with knowing winks to readers of vampire fiction, from Dracula to Lestat, Interview with a Jewish Vampire is unexpectedly credible, even while pumping Catskill-flavored jokes through its basically silly premise. Interview is told in a fast, punchy style: “I was a Jewish divorcee of 41 who claimed to be 35. He had been dead for a long time, but I didn't know that right away.\" You know exactly where it's going, but the road there is a lot of fun.     --Jewniverse; MyJewishLearning.comHYSTERICAL!!! Smoothly written, stereotypes jab you right and left, cliches abound with luxurious abundance, the setting is authentic (in New York and Florida, two places I can drive around in without a GPS), and the CHARACTERS POP OFF THE PAGES!!!  I'm planning to gift a Kindle copy to a friend who could use a great laugh.   --Jacqueline Lichtenberg,  winner of the Galaxy Award for Spirituality in Science Fiction with her second novel, Unto Zeor, Forever from the Sim-Gen series.",

I worried about the structure, which doesn\\'t have a traditional \"narrative arc,\" --but an editor friend reassured me that non-linear memoirs are all the rage. I\\'m not getting any younger here and didn\\'t know how much life I\\'d have left for a narrative arc. This book is my legacy.

My motto: Writing well is the best revenge.\", 'Interview With a Jewish Vampire was originally meant to be a humor piece but an agent suggested I turn it into a book. I intially said, \"Oh no, that\\'s impossible.\" I couldn\\'t think of a way to write a whole book about a Jewish vampire.
