        "Review",
        "\"This book is outstanding, and I would recommend it to all in the arbitration community.\" --Dr Cyril Chern, Barrister, Chartered Architect, Chartered Arbitrator - 4 New Square Chambers, Dispute Board Federation, Issue: 2 Spring 2020\"Given Malaysia's status as a Model Law jurisdiction, the commentary is a very useful contribution to cross jurisdictional and comparative study of the application of the Model Law in practice. The same comment applies to its treatment of the recognition and enforcement of awards under the New York Convention....This book is both a valuable addition to the existing corpus of leading works on arbitration law and practice in Malaysia and an essential reference tool for arbitrators and practitioners alike.\" --Robert Morgan, Barrister & Consulting/Technical Editor - Asian Dispute Review, April 2020 Issue",
