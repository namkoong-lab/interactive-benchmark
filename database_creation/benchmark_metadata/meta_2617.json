        "MANKIND IS ONCE AGAIN FACING ITS ENDThroughout the history of Man, there have been valiant warriors charged with the protection of those who could not protect themselves. These warriors often change the course of history and have been romanticized as knights, guardians, and templar. This chronicle is that of the Blue Templar. The year is 2076, and mankind is on the brink of extinction. Stephan—the lone survivor of the Paladin battalion, which is the only battalion to have survived more than one run-in with the bloodthirsty Ntasyz—and the crew of the Progressive must travel back in time to train humanity to defend themselves against the Ntasyz threat. But before they can even depart, the Ntasyz attack, leaving Stephan to fight off the ambush alone so the civilians can go on safely. With that ominous start, the rest of the mission goes awry as well. Instead of going back in time, the ship slingshots a thousand years into the future. But not all is lost. When a mysterious man appears, known only as Paladin the Blue—a man bearing a striking resemblance to Stephan but with none of his memories—he joins the strange war in which the remaining humans now find themselves…and the fate of humankind depends on the outcome. Templar Chronicles I is a fast-paced debut novel that will propel the reader into the future—a future that is both familiar and beyond imagining."
