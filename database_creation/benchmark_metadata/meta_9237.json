        "Review",
        "...a heartwarming, thought-provoking, memorable story...Most importantly, it is a wonderfully delightful read by a master storyteller. --",
        "Connie Daugherty, Montana Senior News, April 2000",
        "Powerful storytelling...Stanley West is becoming one of my favorite writers. I recommend him to everybody. --",
        "Steve Thayer, author of Weatherman and Silent Snow",
        "[It] reaffirms the miracle of life and ultimately its preciousness...a terrific, uplifting read, written with great insight and compassion. --",
        "Harvey Mackay, New York Times best-selling author of How to Swim With the Sharks.",
        "From the Publisher",
        "We are extremely pleased to bring lovers of Until They Bring The Streetcars Back another helping of great storytelling in the same time and places they acclaimed and cherished. Finding Laura Buggs doesn't miss a beat in the chronicles of those 1949 characters who brought, and are still bringing, tears and laughter, suspense and joy, to thousands of readers.",
        "We are very proud to bring Laura to the reading public. We're receiving the same comments we did from Streetcars: \"...didn't want it to end.\" \"Couldn't put it down.\" \"...read until two in the morning to finish it.\" Stanley West says he wrote Finding Laura Buggs because so many readers wanted more of the same. When we ask him if there'll be a third, a trilogy, he only smiles.",
        "From the Author",
        "I grew up in Saint Paul through the Depression and World War II years, as did the characters in these novels. At this point in my life, I wanted to journey back to those familiar neighborhoods and recall what my life had been about in the midst of those years. I have been overwhelmed by all of the other \"kids\" from that generation who have found the book and written to me, men and women from all over the United States and beyond who share the same memories and experiences no matter where they were raised or went to school. There seems to be a common thread that connects us and I've thoroughly enjoyed hearing from these other \"kids\" and their stories. Finding Laura Buggs is a story that could have taken place anywhere, but I hope that anchoring it to that special post-war era gave it the flesh and blood fiction needs to draw the reader into the story so that the line between reality and fiction disappears.",
        "I've also been amazed by the enthusiasm with which today's high school students have adopted both novels. Believing I was thoroughly out of touch with kids of that age, teachers--in high schools where the book is being used in the curriculum--tell me their students, girls and boys, devour the book in a weekend, come to class excited about it and want to talk about it. I hope I have touched something in the story that is universal, something that will make life lighter and more meaningful and more joyful for anyone who reads it.",

        "From Chapter 16: I didn't want to go home, I wanted to act crazy all night, to do something exciting and to laugh and play with my young friends who would one day sit in the waiting room of the morgue, though they never suspected. When I ended up there I wanted to remember that I ran while I could run and danced while the music played and sang my song while I had my voice.",
        "From Chapter 41: As I rode home across Minneapolis, sitting next to my good friend Steve in his father's faithful old Chevy, I realized this was the deal: That in the end it doesn't matter a hoot who your real parents are or if you ever know them or how they treat you. The deal is we've been given the gift of a life, and we get to decide what we're going to do with it. In the end, that's the only thing that really matters, what we do with that gift!",
