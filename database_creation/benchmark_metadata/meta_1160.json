        "The Gripperwood Concave Carving and Cutting Board collection from Architec combines two innovative elements to bring you a carving and cutting board that you will reach for first and use for years to come. The Gripperfeet on the concave boards assures you a slip-free work surface; the patented gripper technology was introduced in the Original Gripper Boards, a plastic cutting board with over 300 gripper feet on the back of each board. The Concave shape of these boards allows you to carve and cut your meat without worrying about the jucie overflowing on your counter. The difference between traditional carving boards that catch juice in the perimeter trough, is the Architec's concave shape allows the meat to stay with its juice while it rests, ensuring a moist and tender cut. All Architec Concave boards will hold up to 1 Cup of liquid, so not one drop of that flavor filled juice will go to waste! The COncave Carving and Cutting Board collection features a variety of woods, from beautiful, rich and dark Acacia wood to a more classic blonde Beechwood. All of our wood cutting boards should be hand washed in warm soapy water, soaking in water is not suggested and never wash in the dishwasher. For longer lasting performance and beauty, it is reccommended to periodically apply a light coating mineral oil with a soft, clean cloth. The Architec brand offers an assortment of frequently used kitchen items which were created by applying basic principles of architecture & engineering to improve their beauty and function; resulting in a better experience in the kitchen for you!"
