        "Tony Martin first gained prominence as the featured vocalist on the George Burns and Gracie Allen radio show. He was featured in many films between 1938 and 1942, at the same time he made a number of hit records for the Decca label. He appeared in many film musicals in the 40's and 50's and as of 2009 at the age of 96, he still performs on tour. This wonderful compilation features Tony in his prime, singing the classics in his inimitable style. All selections newly re-mastered."
