        "In Harangul, a village in the Latur district of Maharashtra, the Nehra family wakes up to what they believe is an ordinary day. But things are about to take a dark turn in the little village when a mysterious old woman moves into the abandoned house next door. Padma, a simple woman, is married to Mohan, a hardworking tailor. They have four children and are raising them in a loving, traditional Hindu family. They enjoy the culture of their small community and rely on their many friends, elders, and traditions to lead happy and spiritual lives. But soon after the arrival of the strange woman next door, a child is involved in a horrible, fatal incident. Another child becomes seriously ill, and a woman falls to her death from her roof. Then Padma's own family suffers a tragic loss. Mohan and Padma seek spiritual advice, to no avail, and the authorities offer no assistance. Finally in desperation, as things become more bizarre in the colony, a party of brave men ventures out to seek a strong baba from far away. With faith, strength, and a very strong sense of community, the people of Harangul work tirelessly to free their home from the grasp of a terrible evil presence-a daayan who threatens their very existence. The Witch's Revenge is a striking novel that seamlessly blends Indian tradition with suspense and horror-a book eloquently presented by a gifted new storyteller. About the Author: Born in Italy in 1953, Danny Odato, a father of four, had to provide for his family at a young age instead of following his dream of writing. With The Witch's Revenge, his debut novel, his dream has finally come true."
