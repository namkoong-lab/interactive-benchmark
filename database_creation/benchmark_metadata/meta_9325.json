        "The hot summer heat could put anyone anyone on edge but to Daisy Dalrymple, it does seem that her brother-in-law, Lord John Frobisher, is exceptionally tense - and with good reason. Someone with an evil sense of humour is sending him a series of poisoned pen letters that threaten to reveal racy secrets which could ruin him completely. Promising to protect Lord John from public scandal, Daisy travels to his village in Kent only to discover it's teeming with enough gossip, resentment and intrigue to make everyone a suspect... or victim. But then a murder is committed, and Daisy is forced to find the killer before the ink dries on her own death warrant!"
