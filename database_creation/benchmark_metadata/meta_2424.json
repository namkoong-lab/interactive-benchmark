        "I am enthralled by this book-",
        "Jaqueline Van Blarcom",
        "Denise Daisy is a writer that can spin a story that pulls towards the young adult teetering of emotions but still binds you to an adult world that is close to home and just around the corner. You can believe that this story is happening someplace around the bend and she inspires feelings of wanting to experience the characters, landscapes and descriptions for yoruself. I am spellbound and can't wait to read the next book.",
