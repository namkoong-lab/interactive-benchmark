        "About the Author",
        "CARLOS E. SAPENE",
        "Carlos has built a career helping some of the most recognizable brands in the entertainment, fashion and music industries learn, understand and grow their audiences using the Internet like E!, Style Network, Bravo.",
        "DANA C. ARNETT",
        "A long career in television and entertainment culminated in working as a VP in charge of Post Production at a Top 5 reality television company for over a decade, launching such shows as The Biggest Loser, Bar Rescue, Extreme Makeover Weightloss and many others. By providing oversight and guidance to hundreds of post production teams, over 400 series and pilots on multiple platforms were delivered to broadcast television and cable networks.Working for many years as executives in the corporate environment, both Carlos Sapene and Dana Arnett found business was becoming more about delivery as fast as possible for the most amount of money (Carlos) and as fast as possible for the least amount of money (Dana), and somewhere along the way loyalty stopped being valued. While freelancing, they worked on a TV rebrand together and found they respected the same things - innovation and integrity - and the desire to develop long term relationships with both their team members and clients. Out of that they created Wicked Bionic, a full service Digital Agency, where they take their clients successes to heart and get to innovate on their behalf. The huge desire to create successful digital experiences and go beyond what's expected is at the heart of Wicked Bionic where it's not about striving to be good, it's about striving to amaze!"
