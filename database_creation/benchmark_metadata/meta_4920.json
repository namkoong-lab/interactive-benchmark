        "The GAN 11 M Pro is GAN¡¯s upcoming 2020 flagship 3x3 magnetic speed cube. Built with an omnidirectional magnetic core, this cube delivers a unique, enhanced magnetic feel that is also easy to adjust. GAN¡¯s new omnidirectional magnetic core is the industry¡¯s first corner-core magnetic positioning system. In addition to the 48 traditionally placed magnets inside the cube¡¯s pieces, the GAN 11 M Pro features 8 pairs of magnets stemming from the core to each corner base. This magnetic positioning system creates a consistent magnetic feel that is strong without an aggressive snap. The GAN 11 M Pro features the same dual adjustment system as the popular GAN 356 XS. Use the included adjustment tool to set elasticity to 6 different levels. Tension by hand to 4 different settings with the smaller blue nut."
