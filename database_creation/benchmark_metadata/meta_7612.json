        "Seventeen million students between the ages of 18 and 24 enroll in a college program every year. The majority of those students know the value of a No. 2 pencil and the educated guess. But don't worry—one of those elements is not needed here!",
        "Ripe for parody, standardized test prep books certainly teach the average student many things: spelling their own name correctly, what an analogy is, the difference between “ennui” and “enervate”, and how fast that train headed west from Chicago must be traveling.",
        "But none of this information is useful, and very little of it relates to a student's real life. Provocative math problems should help one decide the percentage of dateable guys in a college dorm; crazy word problems can show a graduate how to be creative in drafting their resume without actually lying; and snarky analogies are to tests what humor is to readers!",
        "Endorsed by no one, accepted everywhere it is, the downright dirty and completely useless B.S.A.T. represents both the fun missing from the standardized tests and the best time-waster that doesn't need a dial-up connection!"

That questionable move led to Hallmark's first musical greeting card. He lives in NYC with his wife, cookbook author and lecturer Francine Segan, and their two kids, both of whom had great success using the BSAT to prepare for the SAT."

His inventive work for children has earned him four Grammy nominations, and his topical songs turn up in places like NPR's Morning Edition and Dr. Demento's radio shows. A graduate of Harvard, John has basically thrown away a perfectly good education in favor of churning out the aforementioned tune-age. His satirical albums include the Indie-Award-winning Entering Marion, Helium, and The Official Bootleg Album. He must also answer for the musicals Eleanor: An American Love Story, the perennial How to Eat Like a Child, and the musical version of Freaky Friday. He lives in the Lower Hudson Valley with his wife and son, beta testers extraordinaire. Sordid career details at www.johnforster.com.\"]}"
