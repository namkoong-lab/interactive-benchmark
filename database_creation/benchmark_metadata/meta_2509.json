        "(FAQ). Since 1973, KISS has recorded over 20 studio albums; been recognized as an innovator in rock presentations; witnessed a firestorm of rumors and controversies; remained a thorn in critics' sides; and continues to surprise its massive fan-following, the KISS Army, with various career twists and turns. Moreover, many television shows, movies, toys and even comics have kept KISS a bigger-than-life name in entertainment for decades. Yet with all that has been written over the years, there are subjects that fans have never put to rest when it comes to the \"hottest band in the land\": What were the most significant concerts? Why did Phantom of the Park turn out that way? What were the best and worst album covers? How did the comics come about? And what the heck is a deuce? These subjects and more appear in KISS FAQ showcasing the good, bad, and the weird that has made KISS the legendary ultimate rock-and-roll party band, still going strong after 40 years. Accompanying this entertaining work of solid rock scholarship are dozens of rare images from posters to live shots and beyond. Also included is a foreword by Bill Starkey, the creator of the original KISS Army."
