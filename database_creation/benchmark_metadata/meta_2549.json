        "When it comes down to it, rats in the oven trumps Lesley’s desire to never set eyes on another Brennan family member. So Lesley, a pro at property redevelopment, scrambles to Dominic Brennan’s hardware store for supplies. Dominic knows poison — rat and otherwise — and he sees it in Lesley. The woman ruined his brother’s life. Now that she’s back in town, Dominic’s afraid she’ll drag up the past, the secrets, and the pain. They clash immediately, but mix in a teenage boy, a puppy, some white paint, and some loud music, and what starts as cold fury transforms into a nuclear attraction. This basic renovation becomes a major life refurbishment for them both."

Fierce,paint-sticky hands gripped his neck, her fingers at the base of his skull. Shejerked him down and kissed him with an intensity that drove him back againstthe aluminum ladder. The lowest rung gouged into the back of his ankle. Hesmacked his head on the edge of the utility arm where paint lay in a plastictray. The ladder scooted back a few inches, bunching up the drop cloth beneathit when her breastbone slammed into his chest..."
