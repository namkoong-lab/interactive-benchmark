        "Rock Hudson stars in this science fiction story of an experiment gone very wrong. He plays a scientist who decides to create a human from basic genetic material. The result is lovely Barbara Carrera (the sexy villainess of 'Never Say Never Again') in the role of the creature grown from an embryo. Although beautiful, she displays not only her physical charms but aberrant and definitely homicidal behavior. As she becomes more erratic, the enamored doctor is faced with perhaps destroying his own creation. Roddy McDowall and Diane Ladd also star in this unusual tale mixing sex with science. Running time: Approx. 106 minutes Includes the original theatrical trailer! Approx. 2 minutes",
        "Bonus Material: Beautiful women turned into monsters (and vice versa!) has been a popular theme in horror and science fiction movies. Usually the spawn of mad science (other times, ancient curses), these tales give a new twist to the concept of Beauty and the Beast. Here is a selection of original theatrical trailers and film clips from movies on the subject of naturally beautiful women created by unnatural means. Features the transformation sequence of the robot into a woman's guise in METROPOLIS, mad scientists turning panthers and apes into women and back again, FRANKENSTEIN-wrought damsels made from spare parts, and beauties conjured up by computer nerds. Also included are two versions of THE CAT PE0PLE stories, with females turned felines! A fabulous film fest of fantastic femmes fatales! Approx. 25 minutes"
