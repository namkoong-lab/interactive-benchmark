This mini dryer (49.5 lbs.) comes with a dryer vent hose that’s 4” in diameter, as well as an exhaust connector, lint and exhauster filters. Enjoy drying up to 13.2 lbs. of laundry per load with an inside stainless steel capacity of 3.5 cu. ft. This outstanding 120V clothes dryer runs on 1500W and connects to standard outlets with its 3-proing plug. Choose your drying mode, whether Air Dry, Cool, Warm & Hot. Drying times vary between 30 – 200 minutes. The drying times will be extended over traditional full size dryers due to the fact that this unit uses 120V versus a 220V full size machine. Fill halfway for fluffy, freshy dried clothing.
