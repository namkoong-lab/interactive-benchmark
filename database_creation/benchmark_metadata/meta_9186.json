        "About the Author",
        "Cornelia Nuzum was born Cornelia Marahall in Greenbrier County, West Virginia on 19th August 1856. She married Staats Nuzum (1858-1904) who was of Irish descent. In 1911, some years after the death of her husband, she became involved in the Home of Peace in Oakland, California which was run by Carrie Judd Montgomery. She also assisted in weekly divine healing meetings with Mrs. Montgomery. She became respected as a writer of articles on faith and healing. From this time through to the 1940s, she was a regular contributor to Mrs Montgomery's monthly Triumphs of Faith journal. Mrs Nuzum became known for her devotional writings, many which were published as tracts under the name, Mrs. C. Nuzum. A number were collected into her only book publication, The Life of Faith, which was released by Gospel Publishing House in 1928. The Life of Faith has become a classic and has remained in print for almost 80 years. Mrs. Nuzum was associated with the Assembly of God fellowship from 1914. She was greatly blessed in a ministry of healing which is reflected in many of her tracts. Her particular emphasis was always faith and the blood of Jesus. Her writings also appeared in the Pentecostal Evangel."
