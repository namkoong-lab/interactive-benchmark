        "Children of Nod is a modern take on Dante's Inferno.A violent encounter with a stranger changes Russell Quinn’s life forever. Now the thoughts of normal people barrage his mind, making a return home impossible. Soon Russell meets someone like him and he learns three simple rules.#1 Avoid all populated areas. #2 Anything that appears human and claims it is or was human, but can’t be, is evil. #3 This one above all must be obeyed. If you kill someone—or if someone is dying, even if he or she was a friend, run."
