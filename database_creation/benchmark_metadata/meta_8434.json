        "About the Author",
        "Debbie Christiana is a fan of things that go bump in the night, the mysterious and macabre, and unusual love stories. This led her to write paranormal romance, dark romantic fiction and dark short stories. When not writing, Debbie can be found planning next Halloween's Haunted House, reading something spooky, practicing yoga, sipping wine or hiking the Appalachian Trail with her husband and yellow Lab. Debbie is a member of RWA (Secretary of her local chapter) and the International Thriller Writers. She lives in her Connecticut empty nest with her husband, where her three children visit regularly.
