        "Rob Greebon is a 4th generation Texan who resides just outside of Austin in the Texas Hill Country with his wife and two daughters. As a self-taught photographer, Rob has successfully transitioned his love of the outdoors into an award-winning photography business. His work has been published internationally and appears regularly in local and national publications, television, and in many corporate and private collections. As an admitted morning person, he enjoys the solitude and beauty that comes with a quiet sunrise, whether it's from a highrise in Austin or from a remote spot in the Texas Hill Country.",
        "Since growing up in Austin and graduating from UT, John Rogers has been involved with professional photography and television production for over thirty years. After working for a national advertising agency producing and directing hundreds of corporate video productions, he opened his own business as a commercial photographer. His work has appeared internationally in magazines, textbooks, fine art galleries, and is displayed as large art pieces decorating spaces for companies including Google, Intuit, and Expedia. He says, \"I love trying to capture and reveal the natural beauty of the person, place, or thing I am photographing. Very often I enhance my photographs to try and bring back to the viewer what they would experience if they were there.\"",
