        "From the Publisher",
        "A carefully chosen collection of illustrative stories, narratives, and anecdotes, which illustrate experiential philosophy and action training, used in Sufi teaching. The Sufis are the thinkers who called themselves \"idiots\" in contrast to the self-styled \"wise\". The stories of these self-styled \"idiots\" are in fact skillfully designed exercises in which the movements of the characters portray psychological processes.",

The best spiritual traditions, interpreted afresh, are applied by Idries Shah to our contemporary world. This is his contribution to our spiritual equipment - which consequently now finds itself considerably enriched.\"",

        "THE LOANA man was telling his friends in a teahouse: 'I lent someone a silver piece, and I have no witnesses. Now I am afraid that he will deny that he ever had anything from me.' The friends commiserated, but a Sufi who was sitting in the corner raised his head from his knee and said: 'Invite him here and mention in conversation, in front of these people, that you lent him twenty gold pieces.' 'But I only lent him one silver piece!'  'That,' said the Sufi, 'is exactly what he will shout out -- and everyone will hear him. You did want witnesses, did you not?'",

He devoted his life to collecting, translating and adapting key works of Sufi classical literature for the needs of the contemporary West. These works represent centuries of thought – some call it “practical philosophy” – aimed at developing human potential. Shah’s literary output – more than three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and cultural studies – includes uniquely instrumental teaching stories, some of which he retold for children. His work is regarded as forming an important bridge between the cultures of East and West. It has been translated into dozens of languages and has sold millions of copies around the world. In his writings for adults, Shah presented Sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predates Islam. Emphasizing that Sufism is not static but always adapts to the current time, place and people, he often framed his teaching in Western psychological terms. For more than 40 years, Shah sifted through oriental literature and oral Sufi tradition to bring his contemporary audience narratives, poetry, aphorisms and an enormous range of teaching stories that are appropriate for our time and culture. He pointed out that this work “connects with a part of the individual which cannot be reached by any other convention, and ... establishes in him or in her a means of communication with a non-verbalized truth beyond the customary limitations of our familiar dimensions.”']}"
