        "Bosch Blue Disc Brake Pads were created for the everyday driver, and benefit from the same robust testing and engineering processes as our premium braking line. Bosch Blue offers advanced, platform specific friction formulations (NAO-Ceramic and Semi-Metallic) for optimal performance. Blue delivers superior noise dampening capabilities with OE-style multi-layer shims. Rust inhibitive coating prevents the formation of rust and corrosion which can lead to pad degradation and noisy braking. OE design slots and chamfers deliver superior braking performance and efficient, quiet stops. Precision manufactured to strict tolerances for guaranteed fit, and simple, hassle-free installation. Supplied with synthetic lubricant for reduced resistance on sliding contact points. Set includes brake pads for 1 axle (2 wheels).
