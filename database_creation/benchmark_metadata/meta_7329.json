        "Review",
        "In Sloven's impressive first installment of a planned series, someone is killing psychotherapists in Portland, Maine...Sloven (co-author:",
        "Compassionate Journey",
        ", 2018) makes fine use of her own experience as lawyer-turned-psychotherapist to lay out an intricate, twisty plot that maintains a steady pace...There is a satisfying skewering of managed care health insurance, enough bad guys to provide tension and keep readers guessing, a few psychopathic patients to add to the danger, and a group of analysts still working out their own issues. A well-plotted thriller with a likable, female protagonist strong enough to be featured in her own series. --Kirkus ReviewsEvery time I figured out who was the murderer in Jane Sloven's",
        "Termination of Benefits",
        ", the next chapter proved me wrong.  The twisted plot, with lots of curves and clues, will keep you guessing until the surprising ending which I will not give away. It always astonishes me when a new author is able to write a terrificfirst novel, and that's just what Jane did. Of course, she had a goodbackground for this as a psychotherapist and attorney, retired now andliving in Portland. So it's no surprise that the principle character, Sarah Green, has a lawenforcement background and is now working as a counselor helping peoplethrough difficult and emotional problems. Trouble is, Sarah has lots ofproblems of her own, including visits from the ghost of a friend who was murdered. Amidst the murder and mayhem Sarah wrestles with her attraction to herex-husband and a sexy detective, and then there's the disastershappening in her friend and next door neighbor's life. I can only hope these problems and challenges were not part of Jane's career! Published by Maine Author's Publishing, I guarantee you will find this novelcompelling and very difficult to put down. And there's more good news,because Jane is working on a sequel to",

        "From the Author",
        "I loved writing Termination of Benefits. I loved focusing on the importance of female friendships in every woman's life--not only how central those relationships can be for us, but how we manage ruptures in relationship and repairs. It was fun to work with romantic relationships, delving into the push-pull when ending a powerful romance and the struggles we all face in learning to trust enough to risk our hearts again. Writing Termination of Benefits was also a wonderful way to incorporate all that I learned as a psychotherapist in private practice by weaving what I know about the effects of trauma and the many ways one can clear traumatic experiences through psychotherapy.",
        "From the Inside Flap",
        "~A smart intuitive woman you wish was your best friend, a ghost who means only the best, a romantic dilemma with two attractive men, plus a strain of spirituality--what more would anyone want in a book? Termination of Benefits is an intelligent book that also manages to be a gripping, challenging mystery featuring a contemporary, insightful, compassionate heroine, an irresistible combination. I finished it in two nights and can't wait for the next installment.--Michelle Cacho-Negrete, Author, Stealing: Life in America~Hemingway wrote about becoming strong at our broken places. Sarah Green, the lawyer turned psychotherapist in Jane Sloven's stunning new mystery, Termination of Benefits, knows all about this. Still grieving the murder of her best friend, Sarah finds herself embroiled in a new murder investigation while discovering that she has inherited the family blessing/curse of clairvoyance. We feel Sarah's pain in our own broken parts and hold our breath as the danger mounts around her. --Brendan Rielly, author of the award-winning Michael McKeon thriller series.~Termination of Benefits is a riveting, complex, psychological mystery/thriller. Sloven's writing grabs you by the throat and never lets go. Protagonist Sarah Green, an ex-lawyer turned clinical social worker with psychic powers, leads a cast of finely drawn characters who make the book come alive. Set in and around Portland, Maine, the book's issues are ripped from the headlines: friendship, blackmail, murder, drug addiction, health care financing, child sex abuse, mother-daughter relations, and old and new love. Sloven works them into a plot with more twists and turns than the coast of Maine. Warning: If you start reading Termination of Benefits after dinner, you're likely to stay up all night to reach the very satisfying conclusion. --Michael Castleman, Author, Killer Weed, A Killing in Real Estate, and other books.",
