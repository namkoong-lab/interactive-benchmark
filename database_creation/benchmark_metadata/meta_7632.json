        "A woman is out to clear her cousin of murder charges after a blackmailer targeting the wealthy Carlisle family turns up dead. K.C. Carlisle and her cousin Kenneth Carlisle both grew up rich. Kenneth is a corporate lawyer in an exclusive Northern California seaside community while K.C. has a storefront office on the seedy side of town. She takes whatever kind of case walks in her door. But trouble appears one day when Francine Boutelle shows up pretending she wants to write an expose of the Carlisle family, including some dirt on K.C.'s late and highly respectable father. Francine has visited most of the family and is willing to keep the family secrets in exchange for cash. When Kenneth is accused of murdering the blackmailer, K.C. is determined to prove his innocence, no matter where the trail of blood and deception leads."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "In the new introduction to this Carolyn Hart classic, the author admits that as a young teen she devoured hard-boiled private eye books. She goes on to explain that the present title, first published in 1983, is as near that genre as I have ever come. Attorney K.C. Carlisle, a self-described liberal who practices in La Luz, Calif., gets pulled into a family drama when an unscrupulous freelance writer tries to blackmail her wealthy kin. All the Carlisles have deep, dark secrets—K.C. herself, her mother, two brothers, and two cousins, not to mention her late, sainted father, a judge. The premise strains credulity, as does the blackmailer being stupid enough to invite the victims to come one at a time to her apartment. Still, K.C. does a decent job investigating the case and putting the pieces together. When a potential love interest says to her, You've slept around some, and she shrugs, the reader is likely to laugh out loud. Hard-boiled? Not so much. (Nov.)",
        "Review",
        "“Strong, assured storytelling. A welcome trip back to classic detective stories, made fresh with a strong female voice, written at a time when women lawyers, as well as women crime novelists, were changing the way the world worked. If you’re a Carolyn Hart fan and missed this the first time, rejoice! If you haven’t yet discovered Carolyn Hart, oh, I envy the treats you have in store!”   —",

        "glanced down at the legend, K.C. CARLISLE, Attorney-at-Law, insmall neat gold lettering near the bottom of the storefront window.I didn't stop and look at it. That wouldn't be cool, would it? My generationis, above all things, cool. But it gave me a thrill. Not that lawyeringCarlisles are any kind of oddity, or treat, to La Luz, but it meant a lotto me. I had been among the first wave of women to wash through thenation's law schools. I was K.C. Carlisle, attorney-at-law, and proud of it,still glorying in it after five years of practice, five years of facing down thelady lawyer stereotype. Perhaps that was part of the reason for the kindof law I practiced. But only part. I took almost anything that walkedthrough the door, domestic relations (God, are divorces depressing!),small-time criminal work, wills, mortgages, bankruptcy (and had theybeen on the increase!), titles, workman's comp., even one malpracticesuit. That was the case that proved to me that expert witnesses have a lotin common with call girls. (They strive to please.) I learned a little moreevery day and by the first anniversary of passing the bar exam, I hadgained a lot of confidence in myself and a great respect for our systemof law. Inequities happen. Uneven justice occurs. But the law, cumbersome,tedious, and slow, moves forward in its ponderous fashion andmore than likely, whatever your complaint, there is a remedy.",
        "I liked looking for remedies. I was on the look out for and tookthe lead whenever possible in cases fighting incompetence, corruption,exploitation, or prejudice.",
        "I represented Elida Mason Eliot when the school board tried tofire her because she was a lesbian despite her excellent reputation as ateacher. I won.",
        "I represented Ted MacGuire, who was coughing his life away, in asuit against Consolidated Coal, accusing the corporation of moral andlegal responsibility for black lung. I lost.",
        "I filed a class action suit against the U.S. Army on behalf of JamesMorrison and all the other soldiers who watched atomic nimbuses overthe New Mexican desert and are now suffering from assorted cancers.No jurisdiction.",
        "I filed another class action for the descendants of the Susquehannatribe which was summarily and arbitrarily removed from tribal lands,contrary to treaty, relocated in a desert and generally ripped off in the1880s. That's on appeal to the United States Supreme Court.",
        "I made some enemies. A few old friends of the family studiouslylooked the other way when we passed on Main Street, but I had a hunchold K.C., for Kenneth Calvin, the first Carlisle to lawyer in La Luz,might have liked my spirit. Kenneth had ridden into town in 1866, atattered ex-Reb, looking for a new start in the faraway state of California.He hung up a shingle on the second floor of a rickety woodenhouse at the corner of Main and Mission, and proceeded to representanybody who asked him. If he had, in the long run, opted more for therailroad and mining interests, you could only say he knew a dollar whenhe saw one. He had, as a matter of fact, done so well that his offspringstill floated at the top of La Luz society, thanks to his acumen.",
        "I unlocked the door and wondered what old K.C. would think ifhe could see my office. It was as simple as his first had been.",
        "Two straight chairs and my secretary's desk crowded the entryroom. I flicked on the overhead light and followed the narrow shorthallway to my office door. In a tiny room to the left was my law library.The equally small bathroom was on the right.",
        "I opened my office door, turned on the light, and sighed when Isaw my overflowing 'in' box. I looked at the top of the stack. Good. Pathad finished the brief I would file Monday in the Patterson lawsuit,asking damages and a prohibition of further slander of Mabel Patterson'scredit by the Central Credit Bureau which had dropped her ratingfrom good to poor because of her divorce. Pat was a marvel and I wouldbe sorry when he finished night law school. He was an excellent typist,an efficient office manager, and quite a bit brighter than I'd assumedan aging halfback could be. He was still a local hero in La Luz, the aficionadosremembering the fall Friday seven years past when Pat hadrun a kick-off back eighty-six yards for a touchdown against archrivalCordova. I had already invited Pat to practice with me and he hadsmiled wistfully, or as wistfully as anybody his size could, and shakenhis head. He had hopes of landing a clerkship with a federal districtjudge and thereby making a play, after a year, for one of the blue-chipfirms. I couldn't fault him for that. There are all kinds of law to practiceand each is necessary for the whole to function. I don't have any prejudiceagainst my brethren in the corporate warrens or in the big businessfirms. I think of us all as worker ants, each carrying his little particle, theend result being the survival of society.",
        "If that seems a little grand, think about it. In",
        "King Richard III",
        ", theconspirators plan first to be rid of all the lawyers. Why? Because theyknew their chicanery couldn't survive the law. It's the lawyers who holdus together, keep us apart, and maintain civility. If you don't believe it,imagine for a moment what it would be like without them. It wouldbe back to rule by force and God love you if you're weak, poor, or havesomething a bigger guy wants.",
        "So I didn't mark Pat as a loss because he wanted to be a corporatelawyer and affluent to boot. I just hoped I could find another secretaryas capable as he. And maybe as big. His bulk discouraged the hoods andwinos who clustered at the Red Dog Tavern down the street. I had beenbroken into twice before I hired Pat.",
        "It was a tough part of town, although only two blocks from theglass-encased modern business district, but I didn't want to move.Slowly, gradually, I was becoming known to working class people. Theyknew where they were on my street. My office, plain and unpretentious,was as much a statement of my practice as the Persian rugs and inlaidflooring were a statement of my cousin Kenneth's.",
        "I was happy as a clam with my surroundings, but I wasn't stupid.I had taken time, when I came in, to shove home the bolt on the frontdoor. It was almost nine o'clock and my street was about as safe as apath in Sherwood Forest after dark. Normally, I avoided coming to theoffice at night but I needed to check my 'in' box. I had spent the day incourt in the little town of Rosemont, a five-hour drive to the north. ButI wasn't going to stay long. A quick check of the mail and I would headhome to my apartment, a languid swim, a late light dinner and an evenmore languid nightcap.",
        "Then I saw the unopened letter, propped against my telephone. Pathad appended a handwritten note with a paper clip: 'K.C., I didn't openthis. Thought it might be personal. Several matters are ready for sig., seein box. Also, your mother called, wanted call returned, also some dame(youngish sounding) called four times, wouldn't leave name. See youMon. Pat.'",
        "My mother had called? How odd. How decidedly odd.",
        "I pulled off the note, saw the letter's face, and was automaticallyirritated. Yes, it would be personal and I knew who wrote it. That infuriatingprig, my dear cousin Kenneth. Kenneth Calvin Carlisle theVth, for God's sake. Which made him think he could be the only K.C.Carlisle in town. That was why he addressed the letter to Miss KatharineCecilia Carlisle. Only Kenneth wrote to me as Katharine Cecilia.Kenneth and the IRS. But to everyone else, I was K.C. (the accent onthe K, as in Kay-cee) Carlisle. It was my name and I had as much right toit as anyone else. And, if you wanted to split legalities, it was my fatherwho was Kenneth Calvin Carlisle IV, not Kenneth's. Kenneth's fatherwas Robert, a younger brother of my Dad's. So I thought it quite unjustifiedwhen Kenneth almost came unglued, in a gentlemanly fashion,after I passed the bar and opened up a law office as K.C. Carlisle.",
        "Who else should I open it up as? I had demanded irritably. Besides,his clients shouldn't have any trouble telling us apart since his officeswere on posh Durango Street and he dangled a Roman numeral afterhis name. It didn't pacify Kenneth.",
        "So I asked why didn't he practice as Kenneth C. Carlisle V. Afterall, he went by the name Kenneth. I was the one known as K.C.",
        "It would destroy the tradition, he replied querulously.",
        "That, I said silkily, was just too bad. Besides, I would have bet mylast",
        "Reporter",
        "that the original K.C. would have felt a lot more comfortablein my office with my clients than he would in the sumptuous decoroussuite of offices where Kenneth and his partners cosseted their veryrich clients.",
        "The quarrel over our name was just another in a long series of disagreements.Name a topic. Put Kenneth on one side and me on theother.",
        "I ripped open the letter.",
        "Dear Katharine:",
        "The beneficiaries of the Cochran-Carlisle Trust will meet at 4 p.m.Monday in my office to vote upon dissolution of the trust as suggestedby Priscilla Carlisle. The trustee, La Luz National Bank, has agreed toauthorize dissolution upon a majority vote of approval by the beneficiaries.You will recall that the trust became eligible for dissolutionupon the date when all beneficiaries had reached the age of 25.",
        "Very truly yours,K.C. Carlisle V",
        "cc: Priscilla CarlisleEdmond CarlisleTravis Carlisle",
        "I sat down in the old creaky chair that had once belonged tothe original K.C. Carlisle. He had succeeded as a lawyer but it washis grandson, K.C. III, who really raked it in. Mining, railroading,shipping. If it made a profit, he had some. And, like most of the veryvery rich, he didn't cotton at all to the idea of sharing his spoils with thegovernment when he breathed his last. So he made huge gifts to familymembers and, finally, salted away what was then a tidy two million ina trust with the principal subject to distribution only upon all of thegrandchildren reaching the age of twenty-five.",
        "Priscilla, Kenneth's younger sister, turned twenty-five a week ago.",
        "Now, according to this letter from Kenneth, Priscilla wanted thetrust opened.",
        "That I didn't believe.",
        "Not that Priscilla didn't love money. She did and she spent it likewater washes over Niagara. But Priscilla has the brains of a woollyangora. She would think a trust had something to do with the afternoonsoaps. She never had an original thought in her life.",
        "Somebody had put her up to it.",
        "That left Kenneth, Edmond, and Travis. Edmond is my oldestbrother and his conservatism is as pervasive as my liberalism. He isa grey forty and adding up his coupons must be his biggest pleasure.He and his wife belong to a local chamber music group and take bird-watchingtours.",
        "Edmond's income is high. He has a touch of old K.C. III's moneymakingskill. For that reason, he would be appalled at a dissolution,for his portion of undistributed trust income would be taxed on histax rate.",
        "The trust had been restricted to distributing only twenty per centof the income earned annually. There would be a ton of money to betaxed although the principal was tax-exempt, of course. But the corpushad more than quadrupled in recent years, the trustee having had thewit and, I'm sure, the luck to get heavily into the gold market. That wasback when the luscious metal sold for $41 an ounce. You know what itsells for now. It had always seemed to me to be a bit un-American butnone of the other beneficiaries had any trouble with that.",
        "I didn't actually think about the trust too often. But I rememberedevery quarter when a substantial check arrived. They made the differencebetween stop and go, my first few years in practice. This last yearI had eked out a modest profit. But I could never have afforded myapartment, sauna, Jacuzzi and microwave oven, without that extra. Ormy car. I knew too that there was a contradiction in a storefront lawyerdriving a Porsche. Or perhaps not. The best of all worlds.",
        "But I had never thought about dissolving the trust at the earliestpossible moment and getting my hands on that kind of money. And myportion of the undistributed income would be taxed only at the modestrate of my regular income.",
        "I did some rough, very rough calculations. Each beneficiary wouldcome out with about four million. Wow!",
        "Edmond would oppose dissolution, of course. How about Travis?Travis is my second brother. He teaches East Asian art at the Universityof Chicago and if anyone ever suffered from compulsive collectomania,it is Travis. His apartment rivals the Oriental Institute. If the trust weredissolved, he could buy and buy and buy.",
        "I couldn't imagine Travis working through Priscilla. I suppose theypassed in the halls at Christmas but that would be the extent of theircommunication.",
        "No, it wasn't Travis in the prompter's box.",
        "It damn well had to be Kenneth. And that was a shocker.",
        "Kenneth was as conservative as Edmond, as prudent as the Bankof America, and as cautious as a Baptist preacher at an ecumenicalbreakfast.",
        "Besides, Kenneth too would lose money on the undistributedincome because of his high tax-bracket.",
        "What could prompt Kenneth to favor dissolution? Could it behis political campaign? He had won handily the Republican nominationto run for the House seat for our District, but he was in a hotand heavy contest with Greg Garrison, the Democratic nominee. Sofar, the polls showed them neck and neck, but, if anything, Kennethwas favored as the District had gone heavily Republican in the last twogeneral elections.",
        "But how could Kenneth need money? He had plenty. He had anextremely lucrative tax practice, the income from the trust, and a verywealthy wife. If he really needed money, he had only to ask Megan. Herfortune made the Carlisles look like ne'er-do-wells.",
        "Of course, with Megan's money always available, I guessed that sheand Kenneth lived his income to the hilt, a summer home in Carmel, a27-foot yacht, weekends in New York to see the plays, two Mercedes. Inshort, whatever they fancied, they had. As Greg had said bitterly, in hiscampaign, the Carlisles just wanted to go to Washington, D.C., to jointhe social scene, not to represent the District. Kenneth smiled at theattack and suggested that as much is accomplished at dinner parties inWashington as on the House floor and he and Megan were quite wellequipped to represent his constituency either place.",
        "So it didn't make any sense to think that Kenneth had put Priscillaup to trying to dissolve the trust. Did Priscilla have a new boy friend,one with avid intentions? I would have to find out.",
        "Then I yawned, too tired to care what happened to the trust orKenneth or Priscilla or any of them. I mean, what difference did it maketo me?",
        "Well, it might put quite a huge sum of money at my personal disposal.I had ambivalent feelings about money, as everyone does, perhaps.I hated equating money with worth. I knew, from the most personalof experience, that wealth doesn't reflect anything except a particulartalent, that of making money. And, too often, it was a talent of someforbear, not the present possessor, who might not have the wit to earna subsistence if thrust into the world without a penny. I liked the ideaof everybody starting fresh. The inheritance taxes make a feeble attackon inherited wealth, but, believe me, the ultra rich, with the able assistanceof clever tax-lawyers, stay that way, generation unto generation.",
        "But I didn't have to think about it right this minute. I reached over,marked the time of the meeting on my calendar, then riffled quicklythrough the stack of papers in the 'in' box. At the bottom was a copy ofthe morning paper, the La Luz",
        "Beacon",
        ". I had left early. It was a long driveto Rosemont, so I hadn't read today's issue. I looked at the front page inirritation. There it was again, another editorial touting Greg Garrisonand berating Kenneth. It was almost enough to drive me to supportmy cousin. The",
