        "Product Description",
        "On Christmas Eve the residents of a quiet British cul-de-sac are suddenly plunged into a world of violence, terror, and paranoia when a group of heavily armed military personnel storm their road ordering them to retreat inside their homes at gunpoint. Unsure if this is the sign of a terrorist attack or something much worse, through panic and paranoia, Beth (Neve McIntosh) finds the courage to fight to save her estranged daughter who is stranded across the street. However, with growing dread and desperation, the residents soon discover that the threat is more monstrous than any of them could possibly imagine, and survival is no longer a guarantee. A stunning debut from director Lawrence Gough, featuring an award-winning cast including Neve McIntosh Best Horror Actress at Fantastic Fest 2009, Salvage is a nail-biting exercise in sheer adrenaline-fuelled fear that will chill you to your very core.",
