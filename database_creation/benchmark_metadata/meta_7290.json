        "\"I wanted Holly to know how fantastic I think her book \"Eating Well Through Cancer\" is. I am a registered dietitian and teach a nutrition class for cancer patients. I was given the book as a reference from one of the nurses I work with. It is excellent!!! I will highly recommend it to the patients I teach and also plan to promote her other books and website through the American Dietetic Association Weight Management practice group.\"Marci Anderson, Registered Dietitian Wellness Institute, Provo, UtahThe number one subject cancer patients request information on is nutrition. We have found \"Eating Well Through Cancer\" by Holly Clegg to be the perfect resource for our patients and their family members. The cookbook not only offers delicious and nutritious recipes but the book is organized by how the cancer patients feels and what they need. This book has become an invaluable tool for our patients and their families. Many patients continue to use this book years after their diagnosis.\"    Megan Doyle Battaglia Roswell Park Cancer Institute Buffalo, NY",
