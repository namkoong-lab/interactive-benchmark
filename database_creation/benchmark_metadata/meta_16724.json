Gemstone & Jewelry Care: To clean gemstone jewelry, first wipe it with a soft cloth to remove any dirt. Emeralds require only the use of a soft cloth, as cleaners may damage these gems. Sapphires and Rubies can be cleaned with an ultrasonic cleaner or a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, with a soft brush. Store your gemstone jewelry in a soft cloth pouch or jewelry case. As with all jewelry, normal wear and tear can loosen prongs and settings, so it is a good idea to have it checked by your local jeweler who can make repairs as needed. Support Team: We have a dedicated 24 hour support team who will not rest until your satisfied with your product. Please contact us if you need further assistance. We guarantee 100% satisfaction!"
