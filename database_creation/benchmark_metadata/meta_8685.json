        "Short Fiction. Asian Studies. Translated from the Chinese by Lawrence A. Walker. In this collection of five short stories and one novella, set mostly in China during and after the Cultural Revolution, Geling Yan presents us with the unforgettable characters who have all, in one way or another, left home. Taking as her territory the disorienting space between home and away, Yan charts the unexpected and illuminating transformation of her characters hearts and minds as they find themselves thrust into unlikely intimacy with strangers. [Yan's] stories are very sensuous. One experiences and becomes immersed in her works instead of simply reading them. In my opinion, Geling Yan is the most exquisite fiction writer in the Chinese language today-- Joan Chen. Includes Celestial Bath, the basis for Joan Chen's film Xiu Xiu, The Sent Down Girl. Geling was awarded a Golden Horse in 1998 for her screen adaption."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "The novella and five stories forming the first English translation of this award-winning Chinese author's work explore the intricacies of male/female relationships, and the possibilities of wondrous, generous and unexpected relationships that defy traditional gender roles. But personal identity develops alongside a dominant political atmosphere; each story, elegantly and starkly crafted, is shaped by the policies of the Cultural Revolution, during the chaotic decade of 1966-1976. In the novella, \"White Snake,\" political prisoner Sun Likun, a 34-year-old dancer and former femme fatale, falls in love with a magnetic young man ostensibly sent by the government to interrogate her. She becomes disoriented at the realization that the fellow with the \"fine and delicate\" hands is actually a young woman, but eventually comes to accept this extraordinary, transformational love. \"Celestial Bath\" is the sad and tender story of teenage Wen Xiu, stranded in the countryside after her required government service. Though she haughtily spurns the Tibetan herdsman Lao Jin, he remains paternally protective and loyal, even as Wen sinks into prostitution in a desperate attempt to be transferred back to the city. The young engaged couple in \"Nothing More Than Male and Female\" have had to move in with the man's family while waiting for their own government-assigned apartment; there, Yuchuan falls in love with her fianc?'s young brother, Lao Wu, an artistic, fatally ill introvert whose fragility and enigmatic loneliness touch Yuchuan. And Siao Yu of the eponymous story marries an old man, a stranger, so that she can remain in Sydney, Australia. The translator's unobtrusive, informative notes contextualize these poignant and luminous portrayals of the human spirit overcoming vast and oppressive cultural strictures to find love, transcendence and transformation. (July) FYI: Yan, who has received several literary awards in China for her work, which includes six novels and three short story collections, adapted the story \"Celestial Bath\" for Joan Chen's recent film, Xiu Xiu, the Sent Down Girl.

        "Yan, an award-winning author and novelist in China, makes her English-language debut with this collection of five stories and the title novella. Each work tells a unique, complex, and deeply moving story. The characters are rich, and their situations are explored and developed in a way that brings a fresh interpretation to the age-old theme of the relationship between men and women. All but one story is set in China during or just after the Cultural Revolution. The final story, \"Siao Yu,\" is set in Sydney, Australia, relates the tale of two Chinese immigrants trying to establish residency. Written as carefully as poetry, these remarkable stories, beautifully translated by Walker, will leave an indelible mark. All libraries should acquire this volume. [Yan's story \"Celestial Bath\" was the basis for Joan Chen's recent film Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl.AEd.]ARebecca A. Stuhr, Grinnell Coll. Libs., I.",

        "White Snake ($10.95 paperback original; Jul.; 192 pp.; 1-87996055- 9). This superb collection of five stories and a (title) novella by a prizewinning Chinese writer vividly dramatizes the varied human consequences of her country's repressive and punitive ``Cultural Revolution'' of some 30 years ago. Yen's subdued characters include men and women (in ``The Death of the Lieutenant'' and ``Celestial Bath'') whom forced military service makes unfit for less regimented life outside the army, girls disappointed by arranged or empty marriages (``Siao Yu,'' ``Nothing More Than Male and Female''), and in the wonderfully eerie ``White Snake'' (based on a familiar folktale) a ballet dancer whose arrest for performing a counterrevolutionary art form is mitigated by her undreamt-of sexual liberation. Translator Walker has appended extensive and informative ``Footnotes'' to his admirable translation of Yan's accomplished and seductively beautiful stories. --",
