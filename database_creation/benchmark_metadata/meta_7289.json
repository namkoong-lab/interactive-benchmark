        "“Did Dad have a will?” “What’s Mom’s bank account number?” When a parent or spouse becomes incapacitated or dies, there are hard decisions to make. But the vital information survivors need to settle the estate or arrange for their loved one’s care is often scattered in drawers, jotted on notes, or locked in the memory bank of an impaired or deceased loved one.",
        "Disorganization can endanger your estate and everything you’ve worked so hard for. A will or trust is no use if your family can’t find it. Survivors may not know how to access your bank accounts, apply for benefits, or plan your funeral. An accident, serious illness, or dementia can leave your family scrambling to make critical financial, legal, and healthcare decisions on your behalf. Without the information they need, your loved ones may make costly mistakes that affect the rest of their lives. Don’t let this happen to your family!",

        "----Marisol Smith, Home Health Nurse",
        "This is a wonderful workbook for anyone interested in estate planning and what one needs to know and do prior to passing on. The book is filled with worksheets, which are explained in detail, and how to safeguard the information so relatives can easily find everything and carry out one's final wishes. The book is filled with insights from the authors' past, which provides authenticity to the information provided. The book is well-written and easy to read. The work is especially important to veterans and their families. Many veterans' families have little or no knowledge of how to obtain veterans benefits or services. This book lays it all out in an easy-to-follow format. I highly recommend this book to all individuals who are thinking about estate planning, as a must-have. It will save you time and money to have the information ready when contacting an estate planner and beginning the process.",
