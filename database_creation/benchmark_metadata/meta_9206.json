        "\"Critical acclaim for this desperately needed type of love story. In my 40 years of work as a psychotherapist I often find myself advising patients to \"treat themselves as if they were someone they loved.\" The response I frequently get is \"how?\" Tracy Stopler provides the model, or the \"how to\" in",

        "The focus in her debut novel is adult recovery from childhood sexual abuse. However, the path braved by the main character, Tali Stark, is one that can be followed by all those who struggle with any potentially crippling traumatic life event at any age. Written in a novel/memoir style in the first person, the story catches you on the first page and doesn't let go until the last sentence of the conclusion.\"            Dr. Ted Horowitz, D.S.W., Doctor of Social Work\"'Nobody wants to revisit a war zone,' yet in",
        "The Ropes That Bind",
        ", Tracy Stopler pays such a visit with the ultimate purpose of healing from the inner personal  war of previously unspoken child sexual abuse. In doing so, the author has created a memorable story, a healing antidote, and a story filled with 'the courage and strength to break free from the shame.' This is a series of beautiful love stories... one of family, another of student/mentor, and most meaningfully, one of discovering love of self! Ms. Stopler has truly paved the way for all victims of life's tragedies to become survivors - in fact, thrivers of life's gifts. This book will touch your heart, break it wide open, and then place it back in your chest with added compassion, spirit and love.\" Dr. Seena Russell Axel\"",

        "\"Before I opened this book, I poured myself some wine. I knew there were life lessons waiting for me, and Tracy Stopler did not disappoint. She created a real-life character, Tali Stark, who struggled with a real-life problem, living with the secrecy and shame of childhood sex abuse. She also created in me a sense of hope and a feeling I had never experienced before - forgiveness to my younger self. Because we are all survivors of something, every person can connect with Tali.  So, pour yourself some wine, but don't forget the tissues.\" J.S., Female Survivor",
