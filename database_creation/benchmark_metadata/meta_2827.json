        "*ALSO AVAILABLE AS PART OF A BOX SET*Do you like true crime stories?You should love these tales thenOriginally authentic police files, True American Crime Stories are from the 1920s through to the 1950s - the era of gangster, molls and prohibition. Almost (but not quite), lost in the mists of time, these tales romp along with plenty of action and recreate the atmosphere of this exciting and dangerous era using the vernacular of the times.You may not have heard much about some of these bad guys, but they were real, ruthless hoodlums and all had their \"15 minutes of fame\", leaving trails of death and mayhem behind them.Most did not live to an old age, and those that did were probably in jail.Their escapades were daring and reckless and many paid the ultimate price in the end.Volume 4 contains:*Dillinger - Mad Dog of the Mid WestInfamous bank robber, gangster and latter day Robin Hood, John Dillinger and his gang robbed two dozen banks and several police stations and it's estimated he and his associates were responsible for the deaths of up to 13 lawmen. Dubbed 'Public Enemy No 1' during the Great Depression, he was wounded at least once, escaped from prison on two occasions and J Edgar Hoover used his notoriety at as platform to help develop the FBI into a more potent weapon against organized crime.*Capone's Trigger MenTo John Scalisi and his shadow Albert Anselmi, murder was a business and with a partner like Al Capone providing them with plenty of 'contracts' the blood thirsty duo were soon known in gangland as 'Capone's Trigger Men'. But working for one of the most infamous gangsters in history could only end one way.*Charlie Birger - A Short and Bloody LifeThe vicious feud between Charles Birger and the Shelton brothers made bloody history in the annals of mass murder. Prominent participants in the St Valentine's Day massacre, the gun blazing sadism of these two mobs has gone down in criminal history as one of the most savage periods of lawlessness ever known in America.*The Unknowns Experts in murder and specialists in robbery, they carved a trail of heinous deeds and marked it with their dead. The trans-city armored car job and the Lido Club robbery were just two milestones on their violent paths of crime - yet no one knew them..!Order your copy today!Scroll back up and gain instant access now"

        "From the Author",
        "These short stories are intended to move along rapidly with fast talking characters, plenty of action and fun to read.Whilst the events that took place are true, the author has used acertain amount of creative license regarding what may, or may not, havebeen spoken by the characters to add flavor to the stories.There's no over the top violence and blood letting, (plenty of murders though), there's a sprinkling of mild profanity commonly used in those times and there's no sex. Lots of  \"dames and \"molls\" of course, so imagination will have to come in to play - hope that doesn't disappoint.You could safely leave this open on your Kindle and not worry if one of the kids picked it up.Thanks for taking a look at my book, and if you decide to buy it, I hope you enjoy your brief visit to a bygone era of American crime."

As for my career, well most of it is behind me now, but I've spent time in the military and traveled extensively. Although still working for a living I have plenty of spare time. It's too hot to work out as much as I used to, and I don't like alcohol enough to become an expert drinker, (although admit to enjoying the occasional cold beer or three :-)\", 'I began writing true crime stories a few years ago and have since become totally absorbed by the subject. I hope you find it as fascinating as me and enjoy my books. www.guyhadleigh.com']}"
