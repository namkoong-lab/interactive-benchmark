        "My life is split into two parts—then and now.  Then:I was a wife.Married to a man who was my world and the father of my child. Then, one day, half of my heart was ripped out of my chest. Now: I’m a widow. A single mom who has spent the last nine months trying like hell not to drown in an ocean of grief. I survive in the in-between, but surviving isn't the same as living, and I’m not sure what living looks like anymore. That is, until Jase Turner, my older brother’s best friend and my former crush, comes back into my life. We’re two people tethered together by strands of similar sorrow.  My husband had my past. Jase wants my future.  And maybe where forever ends is just a different beginning."
