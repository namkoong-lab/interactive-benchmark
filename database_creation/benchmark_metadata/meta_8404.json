        "Ra-ab, heir to the Nomarch of the Oryx, grows up in a corrupt Egypt devoted to the worship of Set, the Lord of Fear. When an adult, he joins a group called \"the eyes of Horus,\" dedicated to ending the rule of terror and lifting the shadows of greed, lust, and cruelty from Egypt. Toward this end, he leads his followers into battle to depose the old regime and evil priests. This is one of the most exciting of all of the Joan Grant novels."

        "Joan Grant authored a set of 7 remarkable novels, in which she recaptures the drama and setting of one of her own previous lives. Called \"far memory\" novels, these 7 books offer tremendous insight into the nature of reincarnation, spiritual development, and psychic talents. She also wrote a set of memoirs and one nonfiction study of reincarnation, Many Lifetimes, which she coauthored with her 3rd husband, Denys Kelsey."
