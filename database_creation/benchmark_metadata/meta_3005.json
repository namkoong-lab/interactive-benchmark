        "I wrote this book for you. Often, the death of a beloved pet is a child's first significant loss. Through my work as a pet loss and grief counselor, I realized parents are not only uncomfortable talking with their children about pet loss, but they are also afraid. \"Dear Brave Friend\" not only takes that fear away, but also encourages and invites important and meaningful conversations.This gentle and heartwarming story captures the love between a boy and his dog, and the sadness that follows after his cherished dog passes away.Written in the form of a letter from the dog to the boy, the letter shares relatable, real-life examples of how the boy (and therefore anybody who has lost a dear pet) may be feeling and suggestions on what he can do to help himself get through this most difficult time.The letter also touches on simple acts of kindness that can follow the reader throughout his or her lifetime. The message in this story is applicable to young and old, girl or boy, and to any family pet that has stolen your heart.",
