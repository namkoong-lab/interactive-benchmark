        "The new Everflex 5mm just might be the most comfortable dive boot youâ€ve ever slipped your foot into. The boot features a new arch design that closely matches the footâ€s natural anatomy. Also, the foot pocket is cut wide, creating a cramp-free fit, even for wide-shaped feet. The boot is designed without a side zipper, yet its pliable neoprene allows for easy donning and doffing."
