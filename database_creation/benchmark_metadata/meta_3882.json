        "Tune up repair kit for KUPA UP200 UG12 Handpiece Drill is not included and is for reference purposes only. The blue box on the drill is what the screwdriver is used to remove. Replace these bearings to have a smooth and quiet drill. In most cases it will even stop your drill from heating up if it happens to be a clogged bearing that you are having. Please see pictures above. If your drill's screw holes are damaged or enlarged then these screws will not fit."
