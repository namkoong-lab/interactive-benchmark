        "To her fellow guests at Mrs. Reed’s boardinghouse, Marie seems like just another young woman who’s determined to help with the war effort. She arrives in Washington, DC, in the spring of 1943 and immediately secures a job at the brand-new Pentagon.",
        "But Marie isn’t technically Marie. She isn’t even from the forties. Marie is really Emmy, a college student at Thorburn University in present-day Pennsylvania.",
        "Thorburn’s history department is a tad unconventional. It’s actually a secret recruitment center for “trekkers” who study history by using time travel to observe it for themselves.",
        "While her best friend is sent back to Napoleon’s France, Emmy is tasked with tracking down an Axis spy in wartime Washington. She is focused on her mission until a chance encounter with US Army Air Corps Captain Peter Breckenridge leaves her flustered, confused, and lovestruck.",
        "As she and the airman grow closer, Emmy faces dangers in both the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. She may be on the verge of cracking the Nazi spy ring, but the monties—the time-travel police—apparently believe she is becoming too entrenched in the past. Emmy is falling for Pete, but their romance could have serious consequences for them both."
