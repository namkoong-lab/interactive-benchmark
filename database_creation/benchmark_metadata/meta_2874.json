        "A parable about adapting to change and overcoming obstacles. (Second edition.) This is the story of Ping, a frog who's ignored the signs of his pond drying up around him, and is stuck in the mud. Ping represents everybody who has encountered a setback, needs to take a risk, or is struggling with the challenges of change -- that is to say, he is all of us. Ping's tale inspires us to take risks and persevere-and shows us the limitless possibilities that can result when the decision is made to take a leap of faith."

Along his search, Ping comes under the tutelage of Owl, a wise old bird who teaches Ping about \"the Way\" and the \"intentional life\" and who often speaks in Yoda-ish constructions (e.g., \"Persistent you are. I'll grant you that\"). Meditation sessions with Owl lead Ping to a host of revelations, including the promise that he \"will build [his] risk-taking confidence, starting with small risk, working [his] way up until [he is] comfortable and confident in the taking of larger risks.\" Inspiring to some, soporific to others, this book will probably move fastest at airport bookstores.",
