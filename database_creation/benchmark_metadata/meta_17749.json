Perfect for the well prepared paddle sport angler, this combination pack covers all your bases by offering security for two fishing poles and one paddle. Double braided for extra strength, the nonabsorbent Yak Gear FISH n POLE Leash provides the ultimate peace of mind in guaranteeing that the expensive rod and reel return to shore every time. The boat-side of the.7 ounce, 32-inch leash quickly connects to a pad eye or accessible seat strap with the carabineer or by threading the loop through. The connection to the fishing pole is through the use of the ultra tight Velcro strap slipped over the butt of the fishing pole, just below the trigger of the reel. You catch the fish, we will catch the pole. Also, keep your paddle secure while paddling with the Yak Gear Basic Paddle Leash. This half ounce, 40-inch leash features a carabineer on one end and a Velcro strap on the other for maximum connection possibilities to your kayak or canoe, while maintaining unrestricted paddle movement. Perfect for one or two piece paddles, the boat-side of the leash quickly connects to a pad eye or accessible seat strap with the carabineer or by threading the loop through a pad eye or any accessible seat strap."
