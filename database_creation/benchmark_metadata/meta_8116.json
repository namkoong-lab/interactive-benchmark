        "Review",
        "...Thicker Than Water is very entertaining and will have you on the edge of your seat. The drama was unbelievable and kept me glued to the very end. I was really excited when I read one of the characters with the same name as mine. The ending left me hanging and wanting more, but at the same time thrilled that there will be a part II. Ms. Allen has definitely got the literary game on lock. --Reviewed by Tange...OOSA Online Book Club O.O.S.A. Gets It Read!Thicker Than Water is an energetic read focusing on the relationships between four friends and the many ventures that they dare to encounter... This is my first Takerra Allen read, and I highly commend her on taking an age old plot and portraying it in an impressive and superbly written novel. Ms. Allen incorporates suspense and a tad of mystery to make this an even more pleasurable and intriguing tale... I have high hopes for the conclusion of this story line and anxiously await the sequel! Kudos Takerra...Kudos! --Reviewed by Tazzyt2bossye for Urban-Reviews.com --Tazzyt2bossye for Urban-Reviews.comThicker Than Water is an urban chick flick waiting to happen. Takerra paints a gritty, true to life portrayal, of friendship and betrayal...! --Dutch (Kwame Teague, Author of the Dutch Trilogy)",
