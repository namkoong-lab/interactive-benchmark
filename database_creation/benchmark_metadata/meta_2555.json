        "I slide off his lap and onto the floor. He scoots to the edge of the couch so I'm between his legs. He roughly grabs my chin and pushes it up so his face hangs an inch above mine. \"Before we get started, you owe me a promise.\"\"Sir?\"He keeps his firm hold on me, but his index finger grazes my cheekbone. \"You're never stepping foot in this club again. If you want a club, I will tell you where to go, understand?\"\"I'm-I'm sorry, sir. I—\"\"I want to hear you promise me,\" he insists.\"I promise.\"He licks my lips with the tip of his tongue. I moan, wanting to open my mouth but knowing he hasn't permitted me.His Russian accent becomes thicker. \"How much do you think of me, my dorogaya?\"\"All the time, sir.\" It comes out raspy and desperate, but it's what I am. So needy for him and what he can make me do.\"The first time you saw me, you wanted to kneel?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Have you touched yourself while thinking of me?\"My cheeks burn. \"Yes.\"\"Yes, what?\"\"Yes, sir.\"His lips curl, and my flutters take off again. He releases my chin, sits back on the couch, and points in front of us. \"Strip. Then crawl to me like the sexy baby girl you are.\"Copyright Maggie Cole © 2021",
