They're part of the crew of the Shadow Comet, and simultaneously siblings and competitors. Each wants to be the next captain of their family's starship -- but only one of them will be chosen.\", \"The Jupiter Pirates is part high-seas adventure and part space-age epic -- I've had a blast writing the first three books and am currently plotting out the second half of the saga. Officially the Jupiter Pirates books are for kids 8-12, but readers far older than that will enjoy them too.\", \"As for me, I'm a writer, editor, and digital-content guy based in Brooklyn, N.Y. I've written more than 50 Star Wars books and short stories, as well as novels set in the Minecraft and Transformers universes. In a previous life I spent more than 12 years at The Wall Street Journal Online, where I wrote the Real Time column about technology and co-wrote The Daily Fix, a daily roundup of great sportswriting. Since 2005 I've co-written Faith and Fear in Flushing (faithandfearinflushing.com), a blog about the New York Mets, with my friend Greg Prince.\", \"If that seems like an odd mix, well, I think so too. But one way or another, I've written or worked with writers nearly all my life. It's all I ever wanted to do, and I'm profoundly grateful that I've been able to do it.\", \"Whether you're writing about a far-off galaxy or a nearby baseball team, the path to becoming a successful writer is the same: Write every day, learn from other writers and from good editors, push your writing to make sure it's as clear and engaging as possible, and value every form of writing you get to do. And be nice -- it takes a team to get a book from idea to bookstore shelves, and everyone else involved deserves your help, respect and gratitude.\", 'For more on the Jupiter Pirates, drop by jupiterpirates.com.
