        "🏡 GREAT STUFF PRO FIREBLOCK! Dow Enerfoam Professional Foam Sealant is a one component, flexible polyurethane minimal expanding, flexible polyurethane closed cell spray foam used for adhering insulated concrete forms, architectural foam and drywall, and sealing cracks and voids such as pipe penetrations. The foam expands only enough to generate an effective seal, retaining elasticity as the structure expands and compresses.",
        "INSULATING FOAM SEALANT! Dow Enerfoam is designed to form a durable, airtight, water resistant bond to common building substrates such as wood, brick, concrete, foam board and most plastics. Its foam skin deflects water, which can help reduce the potential for moisture damage to wood substrates. In the U.S., Enerfoam is also recognized as a fireblock, which means it resists the free passage of flames to other areas of the building through concealed spaces.",
        "🏡 EASY TO USE! Pop the top off of the can, screw on the can onto the gun, open the gun's valve and you are good to go! If the can is not finished after the job is done, leave it on the can and close the valve until the next use. When it comes to the cleaner, however, remove the can from the gun after usage.",
        "🏡 TESTED AND APPROVED! Enerfoam Professional Foam Sealant is tested to the following standard: ASTM E84 – Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials. ASTM E814 – Standard Test Method for Fire Tests of Through-Penetration Fire Stops.",
        "🏡 AWESOME VALUE KIT! Includes: 12 Cans of Enerfoam 30oz, 1 AWF 1400 Non Stick Coated Pro Foam Gun, 2 Cans of Great Stuff Pro Cleaner 12oz."
