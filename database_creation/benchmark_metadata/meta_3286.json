        "A dragged is a small sphere of sugar, used primarily in the decoration of cookies, cakes, and other forms of bakery products. These draggers are produced in various sizes. Draggers have long been used for both wedding and holiday food decoration. More recently, metallic gold, copper, rainbow colors (red, green, blue, etc), And pearlescent colors have become available. The U.S. Food and drug administration considers the metallic-finish draggers to be inedible, and they are sold with a notice that they are for decorative purposes only. They are non-toxic. Although the metallic-finish draggers can be purchased in 49 U.S. States, they are no longer sold in California due to a 2003 lawsuit against several sellers. However, in other countries (including the united kingdom) they are classified as food items and are consumed on a variety of confections. Draggers are made out of sugar, silver, gum Arabic & gelatin. Not for sale in California. Packaged in a heat sealed poly bag."
