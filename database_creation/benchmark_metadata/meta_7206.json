        "The first part of the book explained the origin and evolution of the universe itself, in terms derived from the Hindu concept of cyclical development. The world and everything in it is supposed to alternate between periods of activity (manvantaras) and periods of passivity (pralayas). Each manvantara lasts many millions of years and consists of a number of Yugas, in accordance with Hindu cosmology. Blavatsky attempted to demonstrate that the discoveries of \"materialist\" science had been anticipated in the writings of ancient sages, and that materialism would be proven wrong."

        "About the Author",
        "Blavatsky was a scholar of ancient wisdom literature who along with H.S Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism. In 1875 Blavatsky and Olcott established a research and publishing institute called the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky defined Theosophy as \"the archaic Wisdom-Religion, the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization.\" Blavatsky's extensive research into the many different spiritual traditions of the world led to the publication of what is now considered her magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine, which collates and organizes the essence of these teachings into a comprehensive synthesis. Blavatsky saw herself as a missionary of this ancient knowledge and one of the main purposes of the Theosophical Society was \"to form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color\". Blavatsky's other works include Isis Unveiled, The Key to Theosophy, and The Voice of the Silence."
