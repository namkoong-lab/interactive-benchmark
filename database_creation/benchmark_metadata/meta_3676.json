        "Delicious spreadable Stencil Butter has a shimmer and shine, that spreads easily with a palette knife. It has the body of a soft modeling paste that holds its peaks and valleys for texture and interest and cleans easily with water be sure to rinse your tools immediately after use. Perfect for spreading through stencils, finger-painting, brush-painting and much more. These colors blend beautifully with each other as well as with all of our Mixed Media Goodies, including our Metallic Pastes TCW Stencil Butters coordinate beautifully with our ColorSparx Powders. You can even mix the dry powder into the Stencil Butter to create additional unique color tones. Available in easy to use 2 ounce jars. Dries in 15-30 minutes depending on how thickly applied. Great for use on Watercolor Paper, Mixed Media Boards, Canvas, Wood and more."
