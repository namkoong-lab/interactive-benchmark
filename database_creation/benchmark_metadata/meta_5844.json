        "Super quiet sport slotted brake rotors featuring the new EBC narrow profile slot pattern which helps cool brakes and de-gas brakes under load and speed but eliminates air noise. Coated with black zinc finish Ultimax sport rotors are complete with bearing cups where fitted as OEM and are sold and priced in sets for either front or rear. The price you see is for two rotors, one left one right. Another great feature of slotted rotors is the way they maintain flat and parallel pad wear and avoid the record grooves or galling common with non-slotted rotors. This improves pad contact and braking throughout the life of the rotor and pad set."
