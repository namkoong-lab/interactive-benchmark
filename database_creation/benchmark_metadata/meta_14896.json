        "The Standard of the West Since 1879 The story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making. H.J. soon began his own boot company, Justin Boots, which he operated out of his home to serve cowboys passing though town. H.J. saw the potential for his business, so when a railroad was built ten years later in Nocona, Texas, he moved his family there to capitalize on a bigger market. In 1908, Justin Boots became a true family company when his sons, Earl and Avis, came to work for their father. Their combined efforts pushed the company forward, and just two years later, Justin Boots had doubled its production and was being sold in 26 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. Seven years after their father´s death in 1918, his sons moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth where it still operates today. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboys who have worn them since 1879. After more than 130 years of Western boot making, Justin Boots is still true to its roots. When you purchase a pair of Justin Boots you will own the most authentic and stylish Western footwear available. And with Justin´s patented J-Flex® Comfort System you will be wearing the most comfortable boots ever made. This is why Justin Boots has been crowned the ¨Standard Of The West Since 1879¨."
