        "Based on the true story of a naïve young woman who falls victim to the charms of a smart, handsome and sexy college boy who becomes her abusive (but addictive) husband, this is a romance gone bad. Only through the unwanted efforts of her overly protective family and their questionable connections does she find freedom, independence and eventually love."

I was raised by blue-collar parents who expected me to be polite and well mannered, and who suggested I work for the telephone company, where I would always have a job, and a steady pension.', 'Instead I won a Regents scholarship and snagged a part time job in a sporting goods shop (where I learned for the first time in my life what a \"cup\" was). I was able to afford a local college, St. Joseph\\'s College for Women, where I became aware of the flexibility and strength of women, including the nuns who taught us. I wrote about them.', 'I married early and regretted it too late, when my charming handsome husband began to abuse me. I fled to Europe, where I learned a second language, taught American English to young women and occasionally translated an American song into English at their request. I wrote about them, too.', 'Back in Brooklyn, I continued teaching at Brooklyn Tech where I was the happiest girl in the world, and where I found the perfect husband. Eventually we moved to the very east end of Long Island. We are still there, where I write. First book was Family Matters, about how my connected uncle saved me from the first marriage, and Family Rules, a book of fiction that reflects the evils of the world that we all learn as we grow.']}"
