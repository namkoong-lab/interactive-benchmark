He especially enjoys writing stories that entertain as well as inspire fresh points of view, with a particular eye toward the way that children view the world. Eric was born and raised in New England. Growing up with seven siblings helped him dream up many of his early stories. Now Eric continues to discover new stories to tell while living in Ireland with his wife Helen and their two children, Claire and Eoin.",
        "Margaret Anne Suggs",
        "loves to draw! Her specialty is children’s picture books. For a while she produced illustration for a clock company . . . but that’s a story for another time. Margaret Anne was born and raised in the Deep South, but later moved to Dublin, Ireland to pursue her Master’s Degree in Visual Communication at the National College of Art and Design. When she is not drawing, painting, and making things, Margaret Anne teaches others to draw at a local college. Margaret Anne lives in County Dublin, near the sea, with her dashing husband, two amazing sons, and a whiny cat. She is never too busy to eat chocolat."
