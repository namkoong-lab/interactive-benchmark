        "Janice Kay Johnson is the author of more than ninety books for children and adults. Her first four published romance novels were coauthored with her mother Norma Tadlock Johnson, also a writer who has since published mysteries and children's books on her own. These were \"sweet\" romance novels, the author hastens to add; she isn't sure they'd have felt comfortable coauthoring passionate love scenes! Janice graduated from Whitman College with a B.A. in history and then received a master's degree in library science from the University of Washington. She was a branch librarian for a public library system until she began selling her own writing. She has written six novels for young adults and one picture book for the read-aloud crowd. ROSAMUND was the outgrowth of all those hours spent reading to her own daughters, and of her passion for growing old roses. Two more of her favorite books were the historical novels: WINTER OF THE RAVEN and THE ISLAND SNATCHERS, written for Tor/Forge and now available in ebook format for the first time. The research was pure indulgence for someone who set out intending to be a historian.  Janice raised her two daughters in a small, rural town north of Seattle, Washington. She spent many years as an active volunteer and board member for Purrfect Pals, a no-kill cat shelter, and foster kittens often enlivened a household that typically includes a few more cats than she wants to admit to.  Janice loves writing books about both love and family -- about the way generations connect and the power our earliest experiences have on us throughout life. Her Superromance novels are frequent finalists for Romance Writers of America RITA awards, and she won the 2008 RITA for Best Contemporary Series Romance for SNOWBOUND.

        "From the Author",
        "Dear Reader,   It's with delight and trepidation that I launch a new series of romantic suspense novels set in the small Oregon Coast town of Cape Trouble, where a host of intriguing people think they can heal from their wounds visible or invisible - or hide from dangers they're not yet ready to confront.   I don't know what it says about me that I love to write about characters haunted by childhood events! Sophie Thomsen spent summers in Cape Trouble as a child, until one foggy morning when she heard her mother die and found her body between the sand dunes. Of course that tragedy has nothing to do with the murder of Sophie's aunt twenty years later...or does it?   And doesn't fog give almost everybody the creepy-crawlies? It too often blankets Cape Trouble in Shroud of Fog, a presence as real as Sophie's memories of her mother, a beautiful woman who fascinated too many men.   Developing a cast of characters you'll want to meet again was one of the challenges of writing this book, which begins the series. Not all are likeable, and some harbor secrets that will come to haunt them, when their own troubles finally catch up to them.   Look for the second Cape Trouble story in August of 2014 - and, in the meantime, I hope you keep looking for my Harlequin Superromance novels in print and as e-books.   There's nothing I like more than hearing from readers! Look for my Facebook page and my website at JaniceKayJohnson.com.   Janice",
