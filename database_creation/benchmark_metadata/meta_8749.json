Ellenton', 'about': [\"The stillness that had descended over my life was unsettling. I was ailing from a lingering case of Empty Nest Syndrome with a surplus of emotional energy that was no longer being drained by the quiet panic of managing my children's teen-age years. I was feeling unfulfilled and knew that I had to take on something... but what? I needed a project that would not only occupy this new found idle time but also be a creative outlet.\", 'It was a difficult adjustment. For several months I floundered, and then… it appeared before me like so many times before-the option to write. Its arms were folded across its chest, a bit annoyed with me for waiting so long, but it had returned to save me, yet again. And it turns out, that at 48 years old, I was finally ready. I knew for sure that I wanted to create a strong female character, I could already see her in my mind and once I figured out the occupation that would suit my smart, ballsy female lead, I began writing FLIPPING.', \"I have regret over disregarding my persistent inclinations to write earlier in my life. Throughout the years there were signs; some that practically waved arms over head trying to cue me in that this pastime that brought deep satisfaction held options for me. But to be honest, I think I knew that I didn't possess the discipline earlier, which actually was a good thing. If I was stowed away up at my desk I would have not had the life experience or the opportunity to meet the many different personalities that I draw from in my writing.\", 'Being among the youngest of seven children, I can recall attempting to share my early literary creations with my older siblings who usually walked away from me before I could finish the first sentence. Family visitors were far kinder but were soon rescued from me by my parents. In high school my knack for stringing together thoughts on paper was received with a bit more appreciation. My best friend was very enthusiastic over my ability to arrive into our tenth grade English class twenty minutes late and finish, not just mine, but her essay assignment as well, while most of the other kids were still hunched over their papers with frustration. In retrospect, I wonder how differently my life would have been lived had I taken more seriously, my penchant for working with words, earlier.', 'Just eighteen months apart, my daughter and son were born when I was in my early twenties. As soon as they were in school full-time, I found myself on the train, traveling into Manhattan to take writing courses. The lessons fortified my passion, spurring my first attempt at a novel. I penned a young adult work, inspired by my children’s descriptions of some of the zany antics on their school bus. Had I taken the next step and sought out an editor to work with me... who knows? But I must not have believed enough and abandoned the project, side tracking myself with something I knew I could make money at. Always goal oriented, I capitalized on another of my hobbies. I began to give racquetball lessons and developed a fitness business. I happily began to work full time enjoying the satisfaction of my growing my clientele.', 'In my early forties my recurring connection to writing surfaced for me again when I wanted to increase business and was able to secure a weekly fitness column in a local newspaper by pitching the editor with a few sample columns that I had written just the night before. Immersed in my growing personal training business, there was no time for writing in those busy days except for my fitness articles. Years passed, my business had settled into a comfortable schedule and before I was ready, my children were out, living on their own. It did not take long for me to tire of going to lunch with the girls and frittering away time. And then, as most serendipitous events in life, my decision to begin writing again was not planned; it was something that found its way to me. www.maryellenton.com']}"
