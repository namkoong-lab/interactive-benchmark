        "An Amish Garden: A Year in the Life of an Amish Garden takes you to six working Amish gardens, from January through December. Matchless photos show the garden asleep, the Amish women putting together their orders for seeds, the preparation of the soil, parents and children planting, the emerging plants, the lush harvest, the food being preserved.           This close-up of a world seldom seen shows how the seasons and Amish life work rhythmically together. Laura Anne Lapp lives with her husband and three young sons in a tucked-away valley. Gardening is simply the highpoint of her year. Step apart and enter this pastoral world of hard work, sturdy families, the freshest of flowers and produce, all in harmony with the seasons."

        "Readers will find themselves in a different world as Lapp shares her yearlong diary of planting and tending a vegetable garden amid the rhythms of Amish life in central Pennsylvania. Lapp and her family and neighbors live a pastoral existence in harmony with the seasons, and she writes about gardening as the act of turning something plain into something beautiful. The month-by-month structure takes readers from January’s planning—a grateful rest period for the gardener—through February, March, April, and May’s cleanup, seeding, and sprouting sunflowers, as a tiny foal enjoys her first run in the pasture. July and August bring a harvest of cucumbers, tomatoes, and corn, followed by clearing out the garden, canning, and freezing throughout the fall for the coming winter season. Jeremy Hess’ lustrous color photographs depict the garden throughout the year and document the creation of mouthwatering dishes made with Lapp’s homegrown produce and recipes, which she shares. This lovely and unusual blend of personal reflections, gardening insights, and cooking suggestions will delight readers interested in nature, gardening, food, and Amish life. --Whitney Scott",
