        "Because It's There takes us on a marvelous photographic journey with more than 90 adventurous and spectacular images from five continents. Authors/Photographers Charlie and Diane Winger believe there is no better reason to move beyond a familiar horizon, explore what lies around the next bend, and discover a world outside our previous experience than \"Because it's there.\"Like George Mallory, who uttered that famous response when asked why he strove to be the first to climb Mount Everest, the Wingers are also inspired by mountains. Charlie is the mountaineer of the family, and nearly all the snow-covered, glaciated, massive peaks in this photographic journey were his passion (and obsession). Diane is the hiker and casual rock climber, but has ventured up a few of those more challenging mountains along the way.The Wingers draw on their extensive collection of photographs taken while writing guidebooks, climbing and trekking among some of the most beautiful peaks in the world, and enjoying time in special outdoor areas which they have come to love. Along the way, they tell a few stories and share a few laughs."

        "Charlie is a prolific mountaineer with a passion for climbing lists of peaks: the 200 highest mountains in Colorado, the 50 state highpoints, 100 USGS-named peaks in Death Valley, the 57 ultra-prominence peaks in the lower US, the highest mountains in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia, and many more lists few people understand (or want to).  Diane takes a more relaxed approach to hiking and rock climbing, placing a high priority on hiking on established trails, and hiking to places that are scenic. She is a member of the unofficial \"49ers Club,\" having reached the top of 49 state highpoints. Her motto: \"Just say no to Denali.\"  Charlie and Diane live in Colorado and are co-authors of several guidebooks on outdoor recreation. They also collaborated on Charlie's memoir which delves into more details about his numerous climbing adventures and divulges his very surprising and inspiring personal history.
