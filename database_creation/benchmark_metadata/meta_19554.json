        "You've seen him before - he's the quiet soft-spoken guy with the fuzzy afro hair painting mountains and trees with big brushes in a matter of seconds. Bob Ross is public television's most beloved personality and here is the behind-the-story look at his journey to becoming America's pop-culture icon. This docu-story reveals the personal life of Bob Ross through the loving accounts of close friends and family, childhood photographs, rare archive footage - what you know: his unwavering dedication to wildlife for example, and what you don't know: Bob Ross' straight hair, his fascination with fast cars, and so much more. You'll see rare film clips of Bob Ross with mentor William Alexander, and the very first rough-cut Joy of Painting episode. And you'll learn how one little TV commercial to advertise local painting classes slowly turned this gentle-mannered fellow from simple beginnings into a viral phenomenon that continues to allow millions around the world to realize their dream of becoming an artist. Enjoy fascinating interviews and insights from some famous Bob Ross enthusiasts too, such as talk show pioneer Phil Donahue, film stars Jane Seymour and Terrence Howard, Chef Duff Goldman, and country music favorites Brad Paisley and Jerrod Niemann. Bob Ross: The Happy Painter is presented in three parts: The Man, the Television Artist, and His Legacy and contains bonus footage not seen on TV."
