        "Treadwell Clear Non-Slip Safety Stair Treads provide instant grip on surfaces in need of traction. Industrial grade texturized waterproof vinyl surface. Please apply to a CLEAN, DRY, SMOOTH surface for optimal results. Coarse or porous materials such as plywood, brick or unpolished cement will possibly be too porous, resulting in poor adhesion. Please also make sure to apply the strips to a surface that is neither very warm or very cold, as it may affect the curing of the adhesive. It is recommended that the treads are applied with light pressure to allow for easy removal of any air trapped under the surface. Once air pockets are removed, surface can be rolled or tamped down for optimal adhesion."
