        "\"People at work no doubt thought I spent my Sundays travelling round endlessly on public transport like a psychopath, but I used to take cookery classes and was in a 'cercle polyglotte' for a while where we all spoke French to North African refugees.\" Muriel's life is changed unexpectedly and forever when she meets Franz; but after many years of happiness the dream is in danger of being shattered when she discovers Franz's first wife is guarding a mysterious, dangerous secret. Fiction full of science about aging and science fiction. In the future who knows which will be which. A good read for now while we continue to grow older. \"Science and science fiction about aging.
