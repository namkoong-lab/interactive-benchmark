        "Import Blu-ray pressing. The Epic, Behind-the-Scenes Story, Deep Inside the Lions Camp - Includes Over 2 Hours of Unseen Footage. Four long years ago it was about pride - the pride that took the Lions close to glorious triumph in South Africa, but it wasn't to be and caused agony for the players, the squad, the management and of course, the army of loyal and dedicated fans. In 2013, Australia, it fell upon the shoulders of one of the youngest Lions squads in living memory to restore the honor of the British & Irish Lions - a win down under was 24 years in the waiting. In true Lions form, they hid from no man and opened their doors to the Lions Raw film crew who captured every moment of our crusaders journey from pre tour training camps to the emphatic demolition of the Wallabies in the 3rd Test in Sydney on 6th July. This is the journey of the Lions 2013 - open, honest, impassioned and brutally candid. Now it is time to see what really happened behind the scenes under incredible circumstances - the personalities, the drama, the lows, the disappointments and the incredible highs. They formed a bond, the unique Lions bond, that would see them through the heat of the battle, four nations, one team, united and dedicated to the cause. Off the field they showed their boisterous youth and excitement of the occasion, on the field they showed their professional, dedicated commitment. With never before seen footage across all 10 games, our film crew worked tirelessly with Tour Manager Andy Irvine and Head Coach Warren Gatland to make an outstanding documentary. With unrestricted access to every meeting and training session the cameras also captured the passion and intensity of the dressing room before and after the matches, with some colorful half time exchanges and captured the pressure, up close, with the management in the coaches boxes. From the crushing lows of injury and defeat to the highest highs of victory, this documentary delivers what no other Lions DVD has for 16 years - a winning series to savor. This is the first Lions behind the scenes film to be filmed in full HD, including stunning slo-motion and cinematic lenses. If you enjoyed Living with the Lions you are in for a raw treat!"
