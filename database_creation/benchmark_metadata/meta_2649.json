        "From the Back Cover",
        "Kit Livingstone has escaped the clutches of the murderous Burley Men. Now he is on the run through history, the inheritor of an impossible mission - a quest to unite and decode the Skin Map. But where it leads, and what it means, Kit has no idea. Mina, from her outpost in seventeenth century Prague, is quickly gaining both the experience and the means to succeed in the quest. Yet so are those with evil intent, who from the shadows are manipulating the great minds of history for their own malign purposes. The Bone House races across time and continents - from a Bohemian coffee shop to medieval Oxford, nineteenth century Edinburgh, and London, down avenues of Egyptian burial tombs, and finally to a stone-age landscape, where universes collide, and we glimpse an alternate reality. The Bone House is the second book in the five volume Bright Empires series, a multi-dimensional, time-bending fantasy from a master storyteller.",
