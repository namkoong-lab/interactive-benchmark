        "From saber-toothed to tabby, cats have had a prominent place in human history, society, and hearts. Now cat lovers of all ages can discover what's lurking behind kitty's twitching tail and bewitching eyes in M is for Meow: A Cat Alphabet. Beginning readers enjoy the simple rhymes, while older children discover facts about each letter topic in the accompanying sidebar expository. M is for Meow Feed me, pet me, come and play. Let me out, please go away! A cat fits all these thoughts somehow into the tiny word MEOW! General topics such as breeds, behavior, and cat care alternate with charming anecdotal entries. Lavish paintings of cat and owner appeal to enthusiasts of all ages. A back section on cat stats and feline facts provides even more information for pet owners.Former librarian Helen L. Wilbur has loved cats all her life. In explaining her goal in writing an animal book for children, she says, \"Animals don't care if you aren't the most popular kid in the class or whether you did your homework.\" Helen has a BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Chicago, a master's degree in library science from Columbia University, and lives in New York City. Robert Papp's award-winning artwork includes hundreds of illustrations for major publishers across the United States, and his first children's book, The Scarlet Stockings Spy, was named an IRATeachers' Choice in 2005. Robert lives in historic Bucks County, Pennsylvania."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Grade 3-6–Like the other titles in this series of theme-based alphabet books, this one is tough to pigeonhole. The cover, featuring a meowing ginger kitten, implies a preschool alphabet book with suitable illustrations. The pictures are indeed suitable–gorgeous, in fact–rendered in a style that looks uncannily photographic. But the book is jam-packed with facts and ephemera that will be beyond the grasp of an audience reading below a third-grade level. The information is not organized in any particular order, but at the whim of the alphabet itself (A is for ancestors and anatomy, T is for tail and toes, W is for whiskers). A spread of cat stats and feline facts is appended.",
