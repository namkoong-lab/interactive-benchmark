        "The third Wasgij Mystery puzzle ever produced, has been re-released in a special edition Retro range to celebrate the hugely popular Wasgij jigsaw puzzle brand. So why not enjoy this puzzle and see where Wasgij began. ‘Drama at the Opera!’ is the title of this fantastic Wasgij Mystery 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. As the burglar makes his quick get-away, he’s left the stars of the show tied up, and while the manager worries about the burning fuse to the dynamite, the Diva is angry about a particular picture that has fallen from the safe. They say it’s not over ‘til the fat lady sings, you will need to complete the puzzle to see if that’s true. Wasgij Mystery is the ‘What happens next?’ puzzle concept where puzzlers must use their imagination and the clues provided to piece together what the scene printed on the box will look like after a sequence of events plays out. The finished size of the puzzle measures 68 x 49 cm (approximately), and the jigsaws have been produced using high-quality cardboard and precision die-cutting techniques to ensure every jigsaw piece maintains its original shape time and time again. So why is Wasgij so popular? With traditional jigsaws, the puzzler builds the image that they can see on the box. With Wasgij, they must build an image that is different from that shown on the box. Although we give a few clues, Wasgij challenges the puzzler to use their imagination. Put that together with great drawings and pictorial humor, and it is no surprise that Wasgij has topped the jigsaw puzzle charts for so many years. Jumbo’s artist, Graham Thompson, produced this entertaining Wasgij mystery jigsaw puzzle."
