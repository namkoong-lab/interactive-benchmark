        ".  It isn't easy when your daughter's figured out that her mom's a demon hunter-and wants to grow up to be just like her. Or when you suspect your dead husband used the forces of darkness to filch the body of another human. And your living husband isn't the man you married anymore either.  Moreover, Kate's acquired a precious but deadly item that every demon within commuting distance wants. With husband woes playing havoc with her emotions, an ambitious teenage protÂgÂe at her heels, and hell to pay, this stay-at-home mom's putting in a lot of overtime."

        "The breathlessly prolific Kenner checks in with the fizzy third tale of Kate Connor (last seen in 2006's California Demon), wife, mom and Level Four Demon Hunter of sunny San Diablo, Calif. Stuart, her mundane husband, is father of Timmy and stepdad to Allie, Kate's daughter with slain demon hunter Eric Crowe. Recently returned to her job hunting demons for the Vatican's Forza Scura and recovering from rescuing Allie from demonic kidnappers, Kate must now contend with demons who want to liberate their leader, An-dramelech, from within the Stone of Solomon. With the help of David Long, a hunky middle-school teacher who just might house Eric's soul, Kate has tofind the demon-luring Stone and do some major damage control. Also on tap is 14-year-old Allie's intro into demon-hunting and a day of reckoning for Kate's family. Kenner's trademark cliffhanger finale promises further demonic escapades to come.

        "Adult/High School–A fast, fun read. Retired after marrying her demon-slayer partner and having a child, Kate Conner, aka Buffy the Vampire Slayer, moves with her family to a safe town to settle down and lead a normal life. Her husband is killed in a car accident and she remarries, has another child, and settles into a happy family life. Of course, when you know about demons and the realities of the dark side, nothing could be that simple. Certainly the cast here is complex. Daughter Allie becomes aware of her legacy when kidnapped. Saved by her mother, the teen now wants to join the hunters. Eddie, Kate's elderly demon-hunting mentor, lives with the family as a sort of adopted grandfather. An irascible sort by nature, he's making more waves than usual as he makes more and more demands to define his place in the household. David Long, an attractive teacher at Allie's school, may or may not actually be Kate's beloved first husband. Stuart Conner, Kate's ambitious second husband, is running for San Diablo County Attorney, blissfully unaware of his wife's alter ego. Now her not quite three-year-old son Timmy's playdates are being interrupted by demons trying to revive a long-imprisoned Mater demon by the name of Andramelech. What's a mom to do? Teenage girls may enjoy a glimpse of what Buffy has to look forward to. Serious adventure handled with humor and affection.",

        "Finding the right balance between a career and a family is never easy, but throw in a few demons and things can really get tricky. At least that's what Kate Connor discovers when she comes out of retirement to battle the forces of darkness in San Diablo. And if finding time to take care of her family and deal with Andramelech (the latest demon determined to take over the world) isn't enough, Kate's teenage daughter Allie has just discovered her mom's secret \"job\" and now wants to follow the same career path. And then there is rogue demon hunter David Long, who just might be Kate's first, and supposedly deceased, husband, Eric, in demon disguise. No wonder Kate never has time to keep up with her housework! This is the third in Kenner's splendidly creative series featuring Kate, whose wickedly amusing adventures in demon hunting are a pure paranormal delight. Charles, John",
