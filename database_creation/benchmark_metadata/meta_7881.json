        "Review",
        "“Ex-journalist Lippman never forgets as she moves from past to present and from perspective to perspective that nothing is more important―or more elusive―than the truth.” —",
        "Kirkus Reviews",
        "“I’d Know You Anywhere” continues Laura Lippman’s extraordinary run of stand-alone novels (alternating with her lighter books about private eye Tess Monaghan). From its unsettling opening to its breathtaking conclusion, “Anywhere” exemplifies Lippman’s strengths: compassion, intense prose and deep empathy for the snares of ambiguous emotions. —",
        "Seattle Times",
        "“Lippman deftly keeps the balls aloft with a strong structure -- a straight-ahead chronology interrupted by surgical flashbacks -- and evocative writing.” —",
        "Cleveland Plain Dealer",
        "“She’s one of the best novelists around, period.” —",
        "Washington Post",
        "“Lippman’s dedicated fans will find themselves well rewarded with I’D KNOW YOU ANYWHERE, an exceptional novel in every way, which is sure to gain her many new followers.” —",
        "San Diego Union-Tribune",
        "“With the summer reading season coming to a close, don’t let I’D KNOW YOU ANYWHERE be the one that got away.” —",

        "O magazine",
        "This is a story that grips you not with suspense but with its acute psychological autopsy of a survivor. Lippman’s knack for elucidating the horrors humans can inflict on one another through violence and manipulation ― while telling a compelling story ―is disarming and fascinating.- —",
        "USA Today",
        "I’d Know You Anywhere is a crime story, but it’s not a whodunit. Rather, it’s an exquisitely sensitive story about the psychological impact of crime on its victims. It’s a story about shame, about anger, about survivor’s guilt. —",
        "Fort Worth Star-Telegram",
        "Laura Lippman is one of those uncommonly talented authors whose work continues to get better in every book she writes. I’d Know You Anywhere is a riveting psychological suspense novel. —",

        "There was your photo, in a magazine. Of course, you are older now. Still, I'd know you anywhere.",
        "Suburban wife and mother Eliza Benedict's peaceful world falls off its axis when a letter arrives from Walter Bowman. In the summer of 1985, when Eliza was fifteen, she was kidnapped by this man and held hostage for almost six weeks. Now he's on death row in Virginia for the rape and murder of his final victim, and Eliza wants nothing to do with him. Walter, however, is unpredictable when ignored—as Eliza knows only too well—and to shelter her children from the nightmare of her past, she'll see him one last time.",
        "But Walter is after something more than forgiveness: He wants Eliza to save his life . . . and he wants her to remember the truth about that long-ago summer and release the terrible secret she's keeping buried inside.",
        "About the Author",
