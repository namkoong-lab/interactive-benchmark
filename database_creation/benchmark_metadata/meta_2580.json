        "Mark Henwick was born in Africa and left out in the sun too often. An early interest in philosophy and psychology was adequately exorcised by tending bars. And while trying to enroll in a class to read Science Fiction full time, he ended up taking an engineering degree which splendidly qualified him to move into marketing. That in turn spawned a late onset career in creative writing.When not working, he gets high by the slightly less conventional means of a small light aircraft, or down and dirty on a mountain bike."
