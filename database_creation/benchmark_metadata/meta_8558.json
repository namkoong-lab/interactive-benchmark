        "About the Author",
        "Founder of the American Feng Shui Institute in Monterey Park, California, Master Sang is widely recognized as one of the world's foremost authorities on Feng Shui. He has published a textbook titled \"The Principles of Feng Shui\", and was awarded a Ph.D. for his work transcribing the I-Ching.",
        "Raised in Hong Kong, Master Sang began practicing Feng Shui more than 25 years ago and has hosted Feng Shui and Astrology programs in the Southern California Chinese Broadcasting Radio.",
        "Master Sang had taught at seminars jointly sponsored by the University of Southern California and The Northrop University. He has also taught classes at the Samra University of Oriental Medicine.",
        "When Master Sang first came to the United States in 1980, he was shocked by what was being passed off as Feng Shui. He was nearly overwhelmed by the rampant and futile use of so many mirrors, \"magical flutes\", incense and rituals. Indeed, Feng Shui had been stripped of much of its dignity and was being marketed in the arena of the occult!",
        "To reestablish its importance as a legitimate, very teachable scientific discipline, Master Sang established The American Feng Shui Institute in 1991. Ever since the inception, the Institute has recruited hundreds of students from all walks of life."
