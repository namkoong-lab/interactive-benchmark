        "About the Author",
        "Yaakov Kirschen has been making cut out and put together models as a hobby and for friends for many years. He gave out a cut out pattern for a sitting Shuldig (the main character in his cartoons) as a Passover gift when he first published his Dry Bones Passover Haggadah. He has now decided to bring this to a wider audience. He carefully worked out the pattern for the frogs so that it would be easy to cut, paste and put together. Kirschen's cartoons deliver a unique blend of Jewish humor and Israeli chutzpah. Brooklyn born (in 1938) cartoonist Yaakov Kirschen made Aliyah to Israel in 1971 and began writing and drawing his much loved Dry Bones cartoons in January of 1973 for the Jerusalem Post. Kirschen continues his daily cartoons on his Blog, his Facebook Fan Page and in many Jewish newspapers worldwide. Kirschen is a member of both America's National Cartoonists Society and the Israeli Cartoonists Society. The award-winning Dry Bones cartoons are internationally syndicated and have been running in the Jerusalem Post for more than 40 years, reprinted in the New York Times, Time magazine, the LA Times, Wall Street Journal, and other major mainstream media publications. The Dry Bones story has been covered by CBS, CNN, Forbes and many others. His \"Dry Bones Passover Haggadah\" has won high praises as a fun and easy to use, Kosher Passover experience. \"Trees... the Green Testament,\" was acclaimed as a work of prophecy by the Wall Street Journal when it was first published in 1992. Now Kirschen has updated and annotated it and re published it. He has also made a beautiful coloring book of it called, \"Song of the Trees\" that will be much loved. He has also just published a \"Dry Bones Jewish Holiday Traditions Coloring Book\" of memorable Dry Bones Cartoons for every holiday of the Jewish Year. The colorful and fun Dry Bones Passover Haggadah hardcover has become a classic, and the same book is available as a paperback in a large format, very easy to read edition."
