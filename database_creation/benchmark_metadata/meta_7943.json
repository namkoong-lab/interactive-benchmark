        "makes the power of a cutting-edge psychotherapy approach accessible to everyone. Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS) has been spreading rapidly across the country in the past decade. It is incredibly effective on a wide variety of life issues, such as self-esteem, procrastination, depression, and relationship issues. IFS is also user-friendly; it helps you to comprehend the complexity of your psyche. Dr. Earley shows how IFS is a complete method for psychological healing that you can use on your own.",
        "Self-Therapy",
        "is also helpful for therapists because it presents the IFS model in such detail that it is a manual for the method.Many times in the past I used to say to friends, \"I am at least two people.\" I often found myself doing something I really did not want to do, thinking things that I did not want to think, and feeling emotions I did not want to feel and over which I felt I did not have control. It seemed like there was another person inside me. On reading Self Therapy, I was so excited to find out what was going on. Many things I could not previously figure out quickly fell into place. For me it was a very exciting experience--finding out so much about myself. Not only that but this book also taught me how to 'rehabilitate' the 'other me'--or many other 'me's!Reading this book was one of the most enlightening experiences I have had. It is very well written and the author's attitude comes across very clearly and powerfully. There is no doubt but it written with a kind and altruistic heart and with the purpose of really helping individuals to understand and help  themselves and integrate all their part. Self Therapy takes its place among the most treasured books on my bookshelves.-- Paddy Linehan, ThailandSelf-Therapy was a big help to me in the beginning when I didn't have muchknowledge of IFS or myself. The transcripts were intriguing because I looked atother people's experience in the book and recognized my parts. This helped meto realize that I'm not the only one with these difficult feelings. In my journal Iwrote out the answers to each of the questions for my parts, and this brought it alltogether for me.-- Mindy Lamberson, Des Moines, Iowa"

        "Review",
        "The fact that Jay Earley wrote this book is high praise for the IFS model because he was an accomplished writer and thinker long before encountering IFS. Jay's passion has been to introduce IFS to a lay audience so that people can work with their parts on their own. Through well-described experiential exercises and examples of actual IFS sessions, you will be able to enter your inner world, heal your extreme parts, and transform them into valuable resources.\" --Richard Schwartz, PhD, creator of IFS, from the ForewordEnormously hopeful and empowering, this book illuminates the process of Internal Family Systems (IFS) as a method of self-therapy that centers on the revolutionary principle that all of us have a Self. Presenting a view of the human psyche with this calm, compassionate, curious Self at the center, Jay Earley takes the reader step-by-step through a method of self-exploration which views overwhelming emotion and dysfunctional behavior as stemming from parts that are doing their best to help the person survive. Earley's writing is beautifully organized and clear,as compassionate and respectful as the process he is teaching, and the reader is supported and encouraged at every step. Anyone wishing to live a fuller, richer,more meaningful life, or help others do so, needs to read this book. --Ann Weiser Cornell, PhD, author of The Power of Focusing and The Radical Acceptance of EverythingThe non-pathologizing and empowering aspects of the IFS Model find their ultimate expression in Dr. Earley's book, Self-Therapy. Exercises, illustrations, and session transcripts supplement this detailed approach for individuals to safely work alone or with a peer to transform their inner worlds dominated by outmoded beliefs to lives filled with love, compassion, and connection. Therapists, too, will appreciate this clear map of the inner territory of the psyche and will find this book a valuable and accessible resource for their clients. --Susan McConnell, senior IFS trainerJay has the gift of both insight and teaching--and he uses both in his new book. He allows us access to the many many layers of our selves and helps us to understand, work with and ultimately feel harmonious with behaviors that have baffled us. Self-therapy is a wonderful cogent guide written by a wonderful cogent teacher. --Geneen Roth, author of When Food is Love and Women Food and God",

ConclusionAppendix A: Help Sheet for the IFS ProcessAppendix B: IFS ResourcesFrom the ForewordOne way to judge a model of psychotherapy is by the kind of people itattracts. The fact that Jay Earley wrote this book is high praise for the IFSmodel because he was an accomplished writer and thinker, steeped insystems thinking, long before encountering IFS. Jay's passion has been tointroduce IFS to a lay audience in such a way that people can work withtheir parts on their own--without the need for a therapist. He has beenpursuing this goal with great success through his teleconference classesfor several years. Through those experiences, he developed the structureof this book.Another way to judge a model of psychotherapy is by whetherit fosters dependence on the therapist or empowers people to trustthemselves. This book can help you bring a new sense of compassion andhealing to yourself without having to be in therapy. Through Jay's userfriendlydescription of IFS, you will begin to change how you do \"self talk,\"or internal dialogue. As you relate to even your most shameful emotionsand impulses with curiosity rather than judgment and with caring ratherthan disgust, you will find that these parts of you are not what they seem.They are valuable inner resources that have been distorted by difficultlife experiences. Even more uplifting, you will learn that you have a core,an essence, that is untouched by life's traumas. What IFS calls the Self isin every one of us; it is a source of wonderful qualities from which wecan lead our inner and outer lives. In this way, the book releases our selfconceptsfrom the pathological and pessimistic way we have been taughtto view ourselves. It proposes a new, optimistic, and edifying vision of themind and shows how easily it can change and heal.This book does even more than that. Yet another way to judge apsychotherapy is by whether it merely teaches people to cope with their extreme emotions and beliefs or actually transforms those emotions andbeliefs. Through well-described experiential exercises and examples ofactual IFS sessions, you will be able to enter your inner world in such away that your extreme parts begin to heal. Rather than just coping withthem, you welcome them and transform them into valuable resources.You are also encouraged to form partnerships with friends in which youaccompany each other on these inner journeys, which can deepen yourfriendships.This may all sound too good to be true, and for some readersit will be. There will be some who cannot achieve this kind of changeon their own and will need to find a therapist to help them. My twentysevenyears of experience using this model, however, tell me that manypeople can do a great deal of work on themselves without a therapist.They may not be able to unburden all their exiles, but they can reversethe atmosphere of their inner worlds from one of self-loathing to self-loveand Self-leadership. Also, people who are in therapy will find the book auseful guide for their between-session work on themselves.Therapy is too expensive in both time and money for manypeople. I'm grateful that this book allows IFS to extend its reach to thosewho would not otherwise have access to it.Richard C. Schwartz, PhD, creator of IFS, author of Internal Family SystemsTherapy, The Mosaic Mind, and You Are The One You've Been Waiting For.",

It is a gift to those of us who want to offer a gentle excavation of woundsresulting in a beautiful new landscape.-- Cheryl Ades, LCSW, Louisville, KYJay presents an exceptionally clear explanation of the IFS model. He provides\"user friendly\" directions on how therapists and clients can use the process. I canapply it directly from this book.-- Kevin J Miller, PhD, Florham Park, NJJay has a very thorough understanding of IFS and an uncanny ability to break itdown into small enough chunks to make it accessible to novices while still makingit stimulating for experienced IFS practitioners. Self-Therapy demystifies therapyand empowers people to work on themselves to expand and heal their lives.-- Kira Freed, M.A., LPC, CLC, Tucson, AZThe inside of the psyche is so hard to describe, and Jay does a great job of making itaccessible. The illustrations really helped me to get a visual notion of the concepts.Self-Therapy describes each idea in many different ways, so that something sticksfor each person. It really adds to the professional IFS literature.-- Kathy Grace, M.A., LPC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina",

Schmidt, MA, LMFT, Spokane, WAJay has a great talent for making complex things easy to understand. The vignettes are very useful in seeing how IFS works in real life.
