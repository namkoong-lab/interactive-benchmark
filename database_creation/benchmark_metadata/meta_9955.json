        "SEED MIX: Safflower",
        "FEEDER: Use a feeder with no sharp edges or points; the design should allow birds to perch away from the food to keep it from becoming soiled. Set up more than one feeder and allow ample space between them to avoid crowding. Choose a feeder with drainage holes, and add a plastic dome to keep seed dry.",
        "HANGING YOUR FEEDER: Bird feeders are best hung in a place where your visiting birds feel safe from predators. Most important: Avoid open and noisy areas and hang your bird feeders at eye level or a little above. Do not hang feeders too close to any place where squirrels can jump on them, or too low they are within a cat's reach.",

        "NUTRITION: Like all of Pendelton's bird seeds, Safflower Wild Bird Seed Mix is fortified with the essential vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and amino acids that wild birds need. It’s also free of chemical preservatives so you can feel good about offering it to the wildlife visiting your yard."

    "description": [
        "Feeding wild birds is an easy way to add color and beautiful songs to your yard. The best part of wild bird feeding is that you can do it any time of the year. Feeding throughout the summer will not make them \"lazy\" or \"dependent\". It may take a little bit of time for the birds to find your new feeder, especially in the warmer months when there is an ample natural food supply. You can draw their attention to your feeder by spreading seed on the ground or by attaching some aluminum foil to the feeders so the sunlight will reflect and attract the birds. Which birds you hope to attract will determine where to place your feeder. Birds will eat from a feeder the same way that they do in the wild. You can place some feeders near the ground (Sparrows and Cardinals) and others can be up to six feed high (Finches and Chickadees). You can also place feeders on or near windows, trees and shrubs to provide the birds with some shelter as they wait for their turn to feed. To make it more difficult for squirrels and other animals to get at your feeders, add baffles to pole-mounted or hanging feeders and try to place all feeders at least six feet from trees or roof endges from which other animals can jump. Birds will also appreciate a fresh source of water. Avoid birdbaths that are deeper than three or four inches. Add a flat stone as a platform for baths that are deeper than this. A rough texture will make it easier for the birds to get in and out of the birdbath. There are some excellent birdbath heaters available, and they don't use much electricity. Some even have built-in, automatic heaters."
