        "“If you died tonight, where would you spend eternity?” Like the ghosts from Dickens’ Christmas Carol, this question haunts Tatiana Richards on Christmas Eve. With the help of Esther Cook’s Christmas Cake, Tatiana’s daughter Michelle will try to explain to her mother the real message of Christmas—eternal life through a relationship with Jesus.“After someone has eaten the Christmas Cake one time, they always want more. Whenever I attend anything where everyone brings food, whoever is in charge says, ‘bring that apple cake.’ Whenever people experience Jesus Christ, they always want more too. He is the only thing that always satisfies, but in order to understand that you must experience Him.\"Book Two of our new Holiday Collection, The Christmas Cake, features a recipe that has been in the author's family for several generations. It is our hope that both the story and the cake will become part of your holiday traditions."
