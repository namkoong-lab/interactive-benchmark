Severance's comprehensive scope and measured but warm scholarly voice put many of today's more clamoring voices in illuminating perspective. With excellence and careful documentation, Dr. Severance lights up a procession of women who in God's providence helped bring us to this point in history. Reading this book, we not only relish the voices and stories Severance brings to life; we also gain a hugely important understanding of an expansive heritage of women grounded in God's Word and serving God's redemptive purposes throughout human history.\"",
