        "For years, high school English teacher Sue Sommer has given her students a photocopied edition of The Bugaboo Review. Filled with fun ways to remember and correct the most common pitfalls in language, the Review is legendary at her school. Because it’s so accessible and easy to use, parents have requested copies, and the friends of parents, not to mention past students who have worn out their copies but want to take the Review with them into their academic, professional, and everyday lives. With the help of cartoon characters Bug and Boo, Sommer lays out the rules and troublesome words that ?ummox our word processors and email programs. Colorful examples and artful mnemonics help readers painlessly learn and remember it all — including the pronunciation of befuddling words. This is ideal for students of all ages — and also for anyone seeking an A in all their written and oral communications."
