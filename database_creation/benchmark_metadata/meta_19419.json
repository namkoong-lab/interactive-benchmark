        "For six seasons, Charlie Harper has loved ’em and left ’em. In Season 7, he gets left. TV’s #1 comedy pulls a hilarious switcheroo when Charlie’s fiancée Chelsea meets a doctor (score one) who’s generous, thoughtful and mature (score three more). She vamooses, and Charlie – after pickling himself in booze and self-pity – handles the situation in typical Charlie fashion. Which means lots of laughs for Men fans. But Charlie isn’t the only Harper making cement-headed decisions. Alan decides the only thing that separates him from a love god is hair. So he tries the spray-on variety. And Jake decides what he needs to navigate the perilous waters of teenage dating is advice. From Charlie.",

        ", the majority of the episodes revolve around love. And the man nursing a heartache isn't who you'd suspect. Charlie (Charlie Sheen) has always been a love-'em and leave-'em kind of guy. But now engaged to Chelsea, he wants to settle down. Wait, make that he wants to want to settle down. Though his heart wants him to be good, the rest of his body is begging him to return to his hound dog ways. Meanwhile, his brother Alan (Jon Cryer) is hoping that a little cosmetic improvement will help him with the ladies. Rather than springing for hair plugs, he opts for hair-in-a-can. Still, because this is TV, he manages to land a gorgeous girlfriend in Lyndsey (Courtney Thorne-Smith). As for his teen son Jake (Angus T. Jones), when he needs advice about girls he doesn't listen to his somewhat responsible dad. Rather, Jake heads straight to his Uncle Charlie, whose advice to date two girls at the same time ends up with both girls angry at him.",
        "Though it's kind of sweet to see Charlie swooning over a woman he's crazy about, the show's best episodes are the ones where she rejects him. That's right. After all the years Charlie has tossed women aside, he finally gets a little comeuppance--though Chelsea is much kinder than he ever was. When viewers see a real man--not a boy in a man's body like Charlie--lavish love and attention on her, it's hard to be too sad for Charlie. Still, there is a Las Vegas wedding. Whose it is, though, may be surprising. The three-disc set includes all 22 episodes of the seventh season, which originally aired during 2009-2010. Besides the ubiquitous gag reel, the other special feature is \"A Charlie Harper Ex Reunion\"--a segment that features Charlie's many,",
