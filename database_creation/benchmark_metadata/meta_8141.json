        "Feel intimidated by the life-span course? You're in good hands with HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: A LIFE-SPAN VIEW, 8th Edition, as your guide. Complete, yet succinct and filled with real-life examples that aid understanding, the text has proven its ability to capture students' interest while introducing them to the issues, forces, and outcomes that make us who we are. The efficient organization (chronological, but with a few chapters on key topical issues) allows this text to be briefer than many other texts for the same course. The material is relevant, too: You'll gain the foundations in important theories and research that enable you to become an educated interpreter of developmental information in your future career. In addition, basic and applied research along with controversial topics and emergent trends demonstrate connections between the laboratory and life."
