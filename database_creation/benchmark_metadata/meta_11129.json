No matter the age or breed of your pooch,you'll find our potty chimes training device easy to use and our system easy to follow. So how does it work? Step 1:  Hang the bells on the handle of the door you use totake your dog out. You can also hang them on a hook next to the door(a suitable hook can be found at any hardware store). Step 2:  Whenever you take your dog out, allow the dog to move or otherwiseinteract with the door knob bells. When he/she does so, ring the bells and statea command associated with going outside. Provide positive verbal feedback andtake your dog out. Step 3:  Repeat the process, always giving the same command and praise.Make sure that you don't distract your dog from going to the bathroom by playingafter you take him/her outside. If you're going outside to play, don't use thehanging house training bells. After a few weeks of this routine, most dogs will beginringing the bells on their own.
