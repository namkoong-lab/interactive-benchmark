        "Ever loyal to their masters in the Empire, Death Star droids are forever on the lookout for any treacherous or suspicious activity. This foot-tall replica offers a realistic appearance of its movie counterpart, right down to its radio antenna and bulging, fly-like eyes. The droid is made of a tough gray plastic and is fully posable, articulated at the neck, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles. Included is a small mouse droid that rolls about on a set of wheels.",
