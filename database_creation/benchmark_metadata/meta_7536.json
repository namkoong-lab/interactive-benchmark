        "1930, the Isle of Dogs. 20-year-old Lily Bright works long hours on a market stall, selling furniture and bric-a-brac to make ends meet. When a handsome stranger turns up at the stall in search of a bargain, it's love at first sight. Swept off her feet, Lily falls head over heels for the debonair Charles Grey - only to discover, too late, that he's a bigamist and trader in stolen goods. Trapped, pregnant, Lily turns for comfort to her childhood friend Ben James, a former lorry driver who is now a successful businessman. With World War II looming, Lily comes to realize that it's Ben she really loved all along. Will she ever find a way to overcome her mistakes, seize control of her own destiny - and win her true love's heart?"
