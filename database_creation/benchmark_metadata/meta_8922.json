        "From Farson’s Log“There is a world where humanity is finally free from suffering, where everything and everyone is in union.All the cravings, anger, and afflictions are behind us there, those conflicting dispositions of ignorance, greed, senseless aggression, and false assumptions about each other have evaporated leaving only a true sense of purpose and unity. It’s a world with a happy ending – as hard as that is to conceive of for most of you. It took a major alteration in reality. It took the ScreenMasters. Most of all, it took one who was willing to gamble everything.Looking back from that world, I am writing this for you. This is the first chronicle of the ScreenMasters. In another way though, it is also the final story of all that they were not and never could be. Think of the ScreenMasters who came to Earth as discoverers. They came here, like Columbus in the past, and found a savage people living in a savage world. They came in peace to solve a problem on their own worlds. In the end they were confronted with a terrible choice: them or us.Little did they know.”The ScreenMaster Chronicles: The Rise of Farson Uiost is a story about a cataclysmic world event that reveals the deepest secrets of the origin and potential of the human race. In the beginning there is the world we know today, and in the end there was the world we can only dream of. The difference between now and then is Farson Uiost and his sister. Their story of love and courage powers the destiny of billions. The history of human savagery and cruelty created a tear in The Screen around Earth that only Farson Uiost could solve.The only solution was the end of Earth’s history. Farson knew he could do it but only with his sister at his side. Their story is one of desperate love, perhaps forbidden, and a destiny that neither could or would resist. Together, they faced The ScreenMasters’ overwhelming force and power, risking everything for an outcome that no one could predict. Their story should never have happened. But it did."
