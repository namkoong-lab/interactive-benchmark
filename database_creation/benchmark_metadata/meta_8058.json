It covers the key theoretical issues in that field and does it with top-notch readings that are easy to follow and represent different and sometimes clashing perspectives. This book is a wonderful starting point for any student interested in learning how international relations scholars think about the world around them.”–John J. Mearsheimer, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago",

As an introduction to the excitement of ideas and argument in the field of world politics, this book is unexcelled.”–Robert O. Keohane, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University",
