        "This sterling silver pendant features an ancient Egyptian cartouche. Cartouche was written on tombs and coffins to mark who was inside. It was believed by the ancient Egyptians that each person had two souls (known as the\"Ba\" and the \"Ka'\") which needed to find their way back to the body after death in order to move onto the afterlife. It then became popular among the pharaohs to wear the Cartouche's as amulets because it was believed to ward off evil and to protect the name that was written inside.This Cartouche amulet carries 5 known Egyptian sacred symbols. Starting at the top left corner, we have the Ankh, which is the Egyptian symbol of life. Next we have the reed to represent The Field of Reeds. Known to the Egyptians as A'aru, which was a mirror image of one's life on earth. Queen Nefertiti, The Eye of Horus, a ZigZag (representing water), The Great Spinx of Giza, and A Scarab (Left to Right).A sacred design, carefully and delicately hand polished to a lasting high sheen polish finish. This pendant is both of unsurpassed quality and impressive design."
