        "Product Description",
        "They have been described in the UK press as \"American top league equivalents\" destined \"to blow the opposition away,\" drawing favorable comparisons with Gillian Welsh and Alison Krauss. The band has played to audiences in the UK, Germany, Denmark and Belgium - and started 2012 with a performance with the Legendary Béla Fleck and the Flecktones and an appearance at the Celtic Connections Festival in Glasgow Scotland. I Draw Slow is a five-piece outfit comprising vocals, guitar, fiddle, banjo and double bass. Holden siblings Dave (guitar) and Louise (vocals) have been writing together for two decades. In 2008 the pair teamed up with Violinist Adrian Hart, Claw hammer banjo player Colin Derham, Double bassist Konrad Liddy to form I Draw Slow. The five have created a sound, rooted in the old time style of the Appalachian Mountains, drawing on Irish traditional music and Americana. However, this is a whole new songbook of stories and melodies. These are dark tales of trouble, debauchery - but swinging from the kind of well-crafted melodies that survive.",
