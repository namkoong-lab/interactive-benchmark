        "Six new hues of kraft-tex have burst onto the scene with an explosion of color. We couldn't be more excited to add these vibrant paper fabrics to our stash. The new designer line comes pre-washed, giving it a supple, suede-like feel and texture. Stamp, stitch, emboss, print, and more on this fantastic substrate. This new line comes in marsala, tangerine, greenery, turquoise, blue iris, and radiant orchid. ―",
