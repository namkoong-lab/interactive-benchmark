        "Czech released, PAL/Region free DVD: it WILL NOT play on standard US DVD player. You need multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player to view it in USA/Canada: SPOKEN LANGUAGE: CZECH Dolby Digital 2.0; SUBTITLES: ENGLISH, GERMAN, CZECH, RUSSIAN; FULL SCREEN 1,33:1; SYNOPSIS: Acclaimed Czech filmmaker Jan Hrebejk directs this bittersweet coming-of-age story set in the months leading up to the ill-fated 1968 Prague Spring. Teenager Michal Sebek (Michael Beran) develops a serious crush on his hip neighbor, Jindriska Kraus (Kristyna Novakova). The problem is that his family is headed by a dull-witted army officer who believes that the latest East German Tupperware will sufficiently shame those American imperialists, while her father is an ardent foe of the Communists saved from prison only because he is a war hero. Much to the parents' dismay, the younger generation couldn't give a fig for politics. Instead, Michal sports a Beatles mop-top and runs a local film group specializing in Hollywood and pre-war French films, while Jindriska starts hanging out with a mysterious hipster. Pelisky was screened at the 1999 Vancouver Film Festival."
