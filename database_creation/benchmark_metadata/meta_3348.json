        "This superior, ultra-premium quality olive oil is exclusively from the Terra Creta Estate in the Kolymvari region of western Crete and is produced from 100% Koroneiki olives. The vertical production, the extraction of the olives in our innovative olive mill and modern bottling plant, and the close monitoring of all quality parameters guarantee the highest possible levels of health attributes along with an exceptional natural, fresh taste.   At Terra Creta, we are justifiably proud of our olive oil with the ability to control all farming and production steps. This allows us to maintain the very highest quality products.   From cultivation to harvest and bottling to export, we are always ensuring the excellence of our production. However, only a very limited number of olive groves could offer this superior quality of olive oil. Through our long experience and excellent scientific knowledge, we harvest these olives at a precise moment in the harvesting period to offer you this superior olive oil with the lowest acidity we have ever achieved <0.2%.   The production details for this premium olive oil are traceable! See the full laboratory analysis and satellite images of the exact olive farm from which the olive oil in your bottle originated.   Terra Creta guarantees that this olive oil has an acidity lower than 0.2%.   Only available in limited quantity."
