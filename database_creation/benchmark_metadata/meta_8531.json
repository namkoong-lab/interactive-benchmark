        "From the cobblestone streets of Charleston and the beaches of the outer banks to the cozy inns of Asheville and the campgrounds of the Smokies, Hidden Carolinas is a guide to both the prominent and hidden alike. Using her extraordinary descriptive writing skills, author Catherine O'Neal lets travelers know what to expect from every spot in the area so they can plan a vacation to suit their interests. A virtual bed-and-breakfast guide, this book recommends over 100 one-of-a-kind inns. Local flavor is offered in her reviews of 23 barbecue joints and eight restaurants serving hushpuppies. And since everyone loves the coast, Hidden Carolinas describes over 40 beaches and nine lighthouses. There are also details on 63 parks and wilderness areas including information on camping, hiking, and rafting. Each title in the Hidden series offers readers the comfort of detailed maps, internet information for each listing, author picks, suggested itineraries, and walking and driving tours."
