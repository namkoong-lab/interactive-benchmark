If you've ever read Terry McMillan's Disappearing Acts, you may agree with me. It is the book that I read which birthed my desire to write. So after many years of trying to pen manuscripts and studying the publishing industry, my debut novel My Daughter's Boyfriend was accepted for publication by Random House and released to the masses. And what a controversy it caused. Readers had all kinds of fits. It was wonderful. MDB was soon followed by My Husband's Girlfriend (another eyebrow raising novel about a couple with a marital contract), My Best Friend and My Man, My Sister's Ex, and Brothers and Wives. I must admit my stuff is emotional, controversial, dramatic, sexy, thought-provoking and filled with characters that make you feel SOMETHING whether you want to or not.\", 'In addition, please check out my work in two anthologies both published by Kensington: Crush, also features Michele Green and Lutishia Lovely. The other anthology is Reckless with my novella titled Desperate Housewife; Reckless features Niobia Bryant and Grace Octavia.', 'My first ever series, called Love & Revenge, features the juicy trio of novels: If Your Wife Only Knew, My Married Boyfriend, and Revenge of the Mistress. I hope you get a chance to read them and let me know what you think.', \"As a reading fanatic, I have an insatiable love for contemporary fiction (Niobia Bryant, Connie Briscoe, Electa Rome Parks, Cheryl Robinson, Marissa Monteilh, Margaret Johnson-Hodge, Terry McMillan, etc.), some good street novels (Sister Souljah, K'wan), suspense and thrillers by the masters (John Grisham, James M. Cain, and Sidney Sheldon) and superb, witty, humorous women's fiction (Jennifer Weiner, Jennifer Belle, Sophie Kinsella, Jackie Collins, Candace Bushnell, and the others).\", 'Feel free to contact me at booksbycyd@aol.com.', 'Or Facebook http://www.facebook.com/cydney.rax', 'Thanks for the love!']}"
