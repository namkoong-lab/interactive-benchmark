        "The Bissell BigGreen Commercial OR100 ProTough upright vacuum has a straight handle, an 870-watt motor, and a 12-inch cleaning path. This upright vacuum cleaner is better suited for cleaning carpets than typical canister vacuums and takes up less space for storage. A roller brush with double ball bearings and four bristle strips moves debris toward the vacuum inlet for cleaning. The vacuum fan is reinforced for durability. The metal hood has V-shaped motor vents for air circulation, and the front housing is clear so that blockages can be spotted. A heat overload protection system helps prevent damage to the vacuum. The height of the vacuum head can be adjusted to six positions to accommodate different flooring surfaces. The foot release pedal is made of steel, which is a rigid metal that is resistant to rust and wear. The twill cloth vacuum bag can be emptied and reused. A 50-foot power cord enables the vacuum to cover a larger area without changing outlets than vacuums with shorter cords. Cord strain relief provides flexibility and maneuverability. The vacuum cleaner weighs 14.65 pounds."
