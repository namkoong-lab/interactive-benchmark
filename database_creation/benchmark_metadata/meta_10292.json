        ", \"beyond language,\" is the second Planet Drum album produced by Mickey Hart. More Latin than African, Hart combines compelling production techniques with power players of the drumming world including: Zakir Hussain, master of the North Indian tabla; Giovanni Hidalgo; conguero great from Puerto Rico, Sikiru Adepoju, a disciple of Babatunde Olatunji (a member of the first incarnation of Planet Drum) on dundun; bassist Bakithl Kumalo; and David Garibaldi, traps player. Promising to surpass words, ironically the first track, \"Angola,\" features chanting by The Gyüto Monks Tantric Choir.",

        "The conceptual follow-up to Mickey Hart's Grammy-winning 1991 Planet Drum album, Supralingua finds Hart leading the Planet Drum ensemble forward into new realms of global fusion and sonic sculpture. Featuring some of the most well-respected players in the world music genre, the album pairs Mickey's trademark array of instrumentation from cultures around the globe with contemporary music-making technology, and fleshes it out with inspired and exquisite vocalizations. Supralinga (\"beyond words\") proffers a broad and extremely rich palette of sounds that will boldly lead world music into the new millennium. An extremely strong album, this release is a vivid representation of Mickey's lifetime of musical exploration"
