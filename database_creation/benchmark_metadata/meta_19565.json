        "Gene Garrison (Gene Hackman), a forty-year-old New York college professor, is forced to put his plans to marry and move away from his aging parents on hold when his mother dies. Never able to please his irascible father, Tom (Melvyn Douglas), he's now forced to contend with him without his mother's gentle intervention. His sister, Alice (Estelle Parsons), tells her brother he must assert himself and break free from their father, but Gene is torn by his sense of obligation. Screenplay by Robert Anderson and based on his play, and directed by Gilbert Cates. Newly remastered."
