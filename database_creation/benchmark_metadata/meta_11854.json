        "My daughter need an inexpensive mouse for her laptop. Kids like it. Perfect size for laptop.Really like the style. A bit smaller, which I like, but works well and the click doesn't bother me.Ive been using these a few weeks and I like them a lot, they are a heck of a good bargain.Work great. Standard non fancy mouse that does what it is supposed to for very little money!!We like that they are compatible with our desktop, laptop and notebook, and they fit in well and that they are easy to put on and take off as needed."
