        "Susan (Eva Green, CRACKS, CASINO ROYALE) is a scientist whose research has caused her to neglect virtually everything else in her life, including love. That is until she meets Michael (Ewan McGregor, THE GHOST WRITER, ANGELS & DEMONS), a talented chef, and suddenly everything starts to change - not just in Susan's life, but in the entire world. While Susan and Michael are experiencing new and unforeseen depths of feeling, all around the globe a new epidemic is causing people to lose their sensory perceptions. Are Susan and Michaels increasingly intense feelings for each other in spite of the epidemic, or because of it? a life-affirming look at what it means to love and be loved in turbulent times, director David Mackenzies PERFECT SENSE is equal parts touching romance and chilling thriller.",
