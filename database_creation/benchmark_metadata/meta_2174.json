        "Beware of falling in love with the boy across the street. Disappearing from their dangerous life in Chicago, Ginny and her mother went from riches to rags by way of a new life in the sleepy, rural suburbs of New York. Under the illusion of safety, Ginny blossomed into a beautiful young woman with hopes and dreams for a future her mother was determined she would have.Lucas Young, her best friend’s oldest brother, was the dashing hero in all of her dreams. The man she fantasized about sweeping her off her feet and giving her the happily ever after she had only heard about in her mother’s fairytales. Sometimes, reality wasn’t what we wanted it to be, though. What would happen when Ginny found out Lucas wasn’t her Prince Charming after all? Instead, he was a rough and tumble soldier in extremely tarnished armor who had a propensity to break her heart. Maybe happily ever after wasn’t meant for everyone.50,000+ novel.Warning: This is the first book in a three-part serial spin-off from the Ex Ops Series. Each of the three books will feature a piece of Lucas & Ginny's story and leads directly into the next installment. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS STORY ENDS ON A CLIFFHANGER.

        "\"I always enjoy reading her books because she manages to weave together compelling, engaging, and sexy to create a story that if full contact and full throttle. And, Sweet Agony was no different. \"",
        "- The Book Chick",
        "\"Fantastic writing, outstanding story and characters to love.\"",
        "- Sinful Swag and Sass",
        "\"As a rule I normally tend to LOATHE cliffhangers. Mainly because of where the writers place said cliffy and the bones of the story written. That being said, Sweet Agony is my idea of a PERFECT cliffhanger. It left off at a pivotal moment but left you satisfied. You can take this break between books to really digest the previous story. That is EXACTLY what Jessie Lane accomplished. Had she compressed everything that this trilogy into one book, it would be so long and detailed that I believe a lot of readers might give up on it. Which would be a crying shame because they would be doing an injustice to themselves.\"",
        "- Confessions of a Serial Reader",
        "\"Sweet Agony is a great read! It has great characters and plenty of back story. Taste of sweet first love, heart break, regrets and hope. Everything needed for a great romance. Throw in a hot alpha ops agent and you have the recipe for a read I couldn't put down. A glimpse of some old friends and it totals excellent read. Not a dull moment. Great read and great job. Bring on the next one.\"",
