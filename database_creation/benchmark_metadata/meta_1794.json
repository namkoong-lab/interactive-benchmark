    "description": [
        "Another of the great Lakota Sioux war chiefs and a close friend of Sitting Bull. In the spring of 1876 he joined sitting Bull’s band and traveled with them to the Little Bighorn River. During the battle itself it is said he shot several troopers with his Winchester repeating rifle while riding in the saddle. It is also rumored that he personally cut out the heart of Tom Custer, the general’s brother. In addition to his rifle, Rain-In-The-Face also carries a Colt revolver. The Indian Wars following the end of the Civil War were an important time for the United States. A growing population was forever requiring more land to settle and build on as well as to explore and exploit for its abundant natural resources. Among the land most coveted were the treaty-held territories granted to the Native American tribes. Most Indians reluctantly had to accept and agree to whatever the white men in Washington said. Some however did not. Especially the Lakota (Sioux) and the Cheyenne. Eventually this would lead to war that would involve the U.S. Cavalry and the Indians. The most famous engagement of those times was The Battle of the Little Bighorn which took place on June 25/26, 1876."
