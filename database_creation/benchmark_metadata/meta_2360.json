        "New York Times bestselling author Mike Dooley delves into and goes far beyond his earlier works of Infinite Possibilities and Leveraging the Universe, sharing some of his most advanced material to date. Manifesting Change takes you behind the curtains of TIME and SPACE, revealing who you really are, how you got here, and why you chose this adventure. It's based upon the material that inspired Mike Dooley's 2nd World Tour, shared with over 10,000 people, on 6 continents, in 60 cities.This book illuminates how to move beyond the law of attraction to the next level--manifestation. It's a master guide for following your heart and taking action on your dreams. It includes easy-to-understand exercises, stories, and analogies, and reveals the extraordinarily unique concept, the \"Matrix\" that clearly shows the flow of events that trigger changes in your life based upon your thoughts, words, and actions. From theory to application, you'll learn the true ease and profound simplicity of hoisting up your sails so that they can be filled with the unfailing winds of the Universe in a journey you yourself will chart. This material is designed to slip past your defenses, into your heart, and plant seeds that will blossom into understanding, action, and life changes. It will help you understand what your heart longs for and how to approach it, while propelling you forward with supreme confidence.",

        "JAMBO FELLOW ADVENTURER!I couldn't be happier or more pleased to announce the completion of Manifesting Change: It Couldn't Be Easier. The material in this book was the basis of my second world tour that was shared with over 10,000 people, on 6 continents, in over 50 cities.Manifesting Change explains the actual mechanics behind every manifestation and how you fit into the equation of reality creation, it tells you how to take action on your dreams while not \"messing with the cursed hows,\" and it explains why you are here, who you really are, and all that you deserve. It also includes exercises, stories, and analogies designed to make comprehension and application even easier, and it reveals my extraordinarily unique and wildly received \"Matrix,\" which clearly shows the flow of events that will, or will not, automatically trigger changes in your life based upon your thoughts, words, and actions. I guarantee you will hear things you have never heard from others, ever before.Your great admirer,Mike Dooley",
