        "Breathing the air in the basement was like breathing terror itself. Then I remembered what my father once told me: \"You're only afraid if you think you're afraid.\" Taking a deep breath, I reached for the gold cross on the chain I wore around my neck. It was the cross that I bought in the Vatican gift shop, blessed by the pope. I always wore it--it made me feel safe.",
        "As Brenda headed up the stairs, a blue, glowing, iridescent orb began to form in the far corner of the basement. The orb just hung in the air. I thought I could keep it from moving toward me as long as I kept my eyes on it. Soon, it became a battle of good against evil. The bulb that dangled from the center of the basement went out. I was in total darkness. I tried to remain calm while I kept my eyes on the blue orb that seemed to be growing brighter. A strange feeling at the nape of my neck gave me goose bumps.",

        "The blue orb became larger and brighter as it came toward me. I felt a deep jolt in my stomach and a trembling in my legs.

And, proud that my memoir, A Rose for My Mother, has received the \"Editor\\'s Choice\" award from the editorial board at iUniverse, Inc. My life long study of the paranormal has led me to become an expert in the field of parapsychology. With the belief that Higher Sensory Perception can be developed by anyone, I devoted my life to teaching, speaking and writing on topics of self-empowerment. Over the past 72 years I have moved many times since my birth in Buffalo, New York. Today, I divide my time between the north and the south; in the summer, I enjoy the beauty of nature at my cabin in the Adirondack Mountains, and in the winter I delight in the warm breeze that come from the Gulf of Mexico. My life story gives evidence that hopes and wishes can come true.']}"
