Only Macharius, his will idomitable, has the strength of purpose and leadership to bring about such an immense undertaking, a crusade the like of which has not been seen since the dark days of the Heresy. But the countless wars are all-consuming, devouring men and materiel, and soon even Macharius's trusted generals and advisors begin to question the feasibility of such a punishing and seemingly endless campaign. As the battlefront stretches across the length of the stars and over a thousand worlds, can Macharius hold his crusade together or will it end in ignominy and flame?"
