        "Well known for their obnoxious odor, it is often overlooked that skunks are able to deter almost all predation through non-violent means. They move through the forests of North America with a confidence and innocence not found in other animals. Although there are several different kinds of skunks (hooded, spotted, hog-nosed and striped) in the United States, all of these skunks display an obvious black and white pattern that distinguishes them from other animals.This skull will add uniqueness and authenticity to your arts and crafts products, creating a natural and earthy feel along with reverent warmth that cannot be reproduced through synthetic replicas. It is normal for the jaws and teeth to separate from the skull during the cleaning process; they are then reattached with hot glue. These skulls are of collectible quality at a very competitive price.All of our natural skull and bone products are obtained through legal hunting and trapping operations throughout the United States and Canada. The companies that we work with for cleaning these products support us in the use of the entire animal including the hide, bones, claws, meat and grease produced during cleaning. We continue to support indigenous peoples and rural lifestyles whose livelihood depends on the sale of animal byproducts."
