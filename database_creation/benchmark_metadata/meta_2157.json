Thrust into the treacherous terrain of the Australian Outback and hunted by their captors, these two survivors will stand side-by-side and fight.John and Eve are shocked by a passion that burns hotter than the desert sun and soon yearn for a chance at a life neither one of them thought possible. But even if they survive the dangers around them, they may not survive each other's dark secrets.",

        "This fast-paced novella contains a lot of action and adventure (think kidnapping, secret underground labs and desert knife fights), cool superpowers (stopping time and psychic mind control) and a hot romance (lots of steam between a smart-talking heroine who trusts no one and a sexy, reformed bad boy). It's a little bit paranormal romance, a touch science fiction romance with a side of romantic suspense. So if you like it fast, and fun, and sexy, this is for you!____________________________________________________If you like action-packed romance, there are more sexy anomalies for you to enjoy:Time Thief  - Download for FREEMind RaiderSoul StealerSalvationWhat readers are saying about the",
