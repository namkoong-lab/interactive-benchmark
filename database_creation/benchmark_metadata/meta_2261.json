        "About the Author",
        "Donald E. Pearse Sr. did not complete his first novel, \"FATAL PLUNGES\", until after he became an octogenarian. He served in the U.S. Army in Germany, after which he attended a local university for eight years while working full-time in a steel foundry for five years, and later as a testing engineer for an electrical and pneumatic panel manufacturer. He graduated with a BEEE degree and joined a major communications manufacturing firm. While there he obtained a MA degree, and wrote numerous detailed manufacturing instructions. He also created and wrote major sections of a direly needed, very detailed new procedural instruction manual for introducing design changes for use by multiple design organizations, along with manufacturing, and field installation groups. He retired as a Technical Manager with over 30 years of service. He did not begin formal writing until he attended Creative Writing sessions at a local Senior Center. Since then, he has had numerous articles and photographs published. However, he did not begin writing a novel until Joan, his Creative Writing instructor, who years later became his wife, challenged him to create a fictional character. As he wrote about an Irish orphan boy, he morphed into his character, and that homework assignment grew into this exciting novel entitled, \"FATAL PLUNGES\" He enjoyed writing \"FATAL PLUNGES\" so much, he began working on a second novel, entitled \"A GRAVESIDE PROMISE\", which is scheduled for publication shortly after \"FATAL PLUNGES\" is released. It is an exciting story about romances, mysteries, and adventures deep within a South American jungle. He is currently contemplating a compilation of short stories he has written, and possibly a sci-fi novel. God for has indeed blessed him with the inspiration and talent to write these novels.",
