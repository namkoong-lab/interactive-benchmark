        "This book by Jo Ann Schneider Farris tells it all from the aspect of daily skating as enjoyed by countess young people all over the country and on a daily basis throughout  the year.  I enjoy recalling some of Jo Ann's personal skating history, and I welcome the opportunity to provide a foreword to this chronicle of figure skating written by a \"real\" skater who has done and seen it as a competitor, a widely read writer, and now even as a skating parent.",
