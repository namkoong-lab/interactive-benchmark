        "Howard Fast (1914–2003) was one of the most prolific American writers of the twentieth century. He was a bestselling author of more than eighty works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and screenplays. The son of immigrants, Fast grew up in New York City and published his first novel upon finishing high school in 1933. In 1950, his refusal to provide the United States Congress with a list of possible Communist associates earned him a three-month prison sentence. During his incarceration, Fast wrote one of his best-known novels,",

        "(1951). Throughout his long career, Fast matched his commitment to championing social justice in his writing with a deft, lively storytelling style.",
        "From Library Journal",
        "Since 1977, Fast (The Bridge Builder's Story, LJ 9/1/95) has been spinning tales about one immigrant family, the Lavettes of California, focusing on Barbara Lavette, whose marriages and adventures illustrate the astonishing changes in American life during the 20th century. In the sixth and final book in the series, Fast portrays Barbara's last love affair, with an ex-Jesuit whose spirituality and naivete provide rich material for a master storyteller. Their romance blossoms as the younger generation copes with a multitude of problems. Fast has a good ear for dialog, and most of the story develops in conversations. For readers exhausted by literary extremes, this novel is like an oasis, easy on the spirit. Fans will snap up this final installment, so every fiction collection will want it.",

        "An unexpected sixth novel in Fast's Immigrants saga, issued 12 years after the fifth (and supposedly final) installment, The Immigrant's Daughter (1985). Once again, the protagonist is Barbara Lavette, now 68 and the matriarch of a large and successful California clan. Barbara has always been the archetypal activist (having been, variously, a labor organizer in the 1930s, an adventurous reporter in the 1940s, a defiant victim of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s, and a vigorous supporter of the struggles of blacks and women for equal rights, as well as an opponent of the Vietnam War), and this time out she takes on the case of a young black man she believes has been unfairly treated by the police. She also, to the astonishment of her friends and family, marries again. But her continuing battles for justice, and her honeymoon, are cut short by the news that she has developed cancer. Not much happens here--there are a good many amiable meals, fond chat between family members, a discreet courtship, and the name-dropping and walk-ons by the famous that have always been a part of the series--and the ending would seem to suggest that this really is the conclusion of the saga. A muted, somewhat puzzling, addenda to a lively (and successful) series. (First printing of 100,000) --",

        "In the finale to his successful Immigrants series, Howard Fast reunites us with Barbara Lavette, now the matriarch of her fascinating, tangled family. What makes this family so beguiling is its diversity in both ethnicity and character, for the people are drawn with imagination and insight. Barbara is the rock, the one to counsel and console. One night, a prowler breaks into her house; Barbara yields her jewels but not before asking the young black man, since he is obviously educated, why he became a criminal. He explains that in spite of his education, he is a janitor. When he leaves, Barbara decides not to report the incident because she cannot in good conscience send this young man to prison--it would go against her lifelong liberal principles. When he is caught with her jewelry pieces the next day, she insists that she gave them to the young man, and her family knows better than to quarrel with her. What ensues is a beautiful, intriguing story of one woman's final years of life, involving family, friends, a new lover, and the face of death. Fast is an exceptional storyteller, whether expressing sublime moments of happiness or describing events as ordinary as someone making dinner. This is a wonderful novel.",
