        "ZIG Clean Color is one of the most popular series among ZIG products, offering colors ranging from brilliant, vivid colors, to more subdued shades. The fine brush tip on the Clean Color Real Brush is an ideal tool for illustration, as the water-based dye ink blends freely with water, leaving a watercolor-esque finish once dry. The size and style of the brush allows artists to use the fine tip for painting smaller details, or the broad side of the brush to cover more area. Check out tips and tricks for blending Clean Color Real Brush Pens on Kuretake's Website! Available in a vast variety of colors: each sold separately. Imported."
