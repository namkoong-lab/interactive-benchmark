        "Everybody needs a little love in their lives—is it ever too late?",
        "Pru Plum is the celebrated owner of a famous Mayfair bakery. She wears Chanel and her hair is expensively cut. Few would believe that this elegant woman turned 66 last year. But Pru is not the confident, successful businesswoman she appears. She has done shameful things to get to where she is today, and she will do anything to protect the secrets of her past—especially when, for the first time in her life, she has finally fallen in love."
