        "An A.I. buried America in Sand. Now that its location has been revealed, it wants to live. And evolve.",
        "Hundreds of years ago a nanotech virus nearly wiped out humanity. The kernel of that technology has been locked in a buried military base and guarded by a class of sentries. Divemaster Rush Stenson and his wife Star thought their discovery of the ancient city of Danvar would create a new era of prosperity in the sand worn shambles of a Dystopian America. Instead, they resurrected a power perfect for the tyrant that put them there. Now that the power is set free, the governor will try to steal it back, rebuild America and give life eternal to his loyal servants.",
        "Too bad Rush and his wife aren't feeling too loyal. Soon they'll find the governor is the least of their problems as they discover the oddities of this power and fall victim to its addictive evolution. An A.I. is born within, genetically engineering them to becoming too much like the tyrants they fought to get here.",
        "As the nanotech and infusion of the power source they’ve uncovered changes Rush and Star, they are tempted with the chance of bringing their deceased newborn back to life. Will this child be the one they knew, and if not, how far into dangerous territory will they go to force what shouldn’t be?",
        "Inspired by the world created by Hugh Howey in his novel, Sand, and written and sold with his permission, the Sand Divers books are a stand alone duology loved by fans for its \"breakneck pace...(and) under sand knife fight,\" \"great special effects,\" and \"endearing characters that kept me wanting for more\".This cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic thriller is an ideal fit for fans of Blake Crouch (Wayward Pines), Nicholas Sansbury Smith (Trackers), D.J. Molles (The Remaining), Nick Cole (The Old Man and the Wasteland) and Edward W. Robertson (Breakers)."
