        "Historical fiction; family saga. A two volume book covering the lives of James Winship and his children in England and Ireland during the turbulent struggle for Irish independence, from 1852 to 1923. In Volume I, James Winship's life is chronicled from his early days, as an adopted Irish-born son of an Anglo-Irish lord in County Cork, Ireland, to his steady rise as a decorated war hero in British India and, ultimately, his succession to Charles Stewart Parnell, as leader of the Irish party in the House of Commons in the late 1890s. Volume II covers the life of his children: his son in British India and World War I, and his daughter in New York City, England, and Ireland. Volume I was first published in 1995 but was rewritten by the author in 2012. Volume II will be available in spring 2013."

        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "\"Well-written with a mix of action, adventure, politics and historical detail. McCarthy portrays some fascinating, well-drawn characters: Oliver  Locke, an outrageous dandy styled after Oscar Wilde; Reg Archer, a dashing,  womanizing officer; Rajah Ali, an Anglophile Indian prince who delights in  philosophical discourse; and Paddy Tierney, an Irish sergeant who speaks  endlessly of taking back Ireland through land ownership...an excellent choice  for readers interested in Anglo-Irish history.\" Kirkus Reviews",
