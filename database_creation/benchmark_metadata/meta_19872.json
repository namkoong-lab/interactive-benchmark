    "description": [
        "Hodge Silk Swabs are premium swabs made from pure silk for removing moisture from woodwind instruments after each use. Hodge uses silk because it is absorbent, has no lint, and is compressible. They do not leave lint in the keys. They are not stored inside the instrument so the moisture does not remain. Hodge swabs are regularly recommended by repairmen for optimum care of your instrument. The silk piccolo swabs are great for any level of flutist. They are soft enough for polishing the instrument and absorbent enough to soak up the water when swabbing the inside of the instrument. Simply thread through the end of any cleaning rod."
