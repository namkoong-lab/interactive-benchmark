        "Jennifer Thompson was raped at knifepoint by a man who broke into her apartment while she slept. She was able to escape, and eventually positively identified Ronald Cotton as her attacker. Ronald insisted that she was mistaken-- but Jennifer's positive identification was the compelling evidence that put him behind bars. After eleven years, Ronald was allowed to take a DNA test that proved his innocence. He was released, after serving more than a decade in prison for a crime he never committed. Two years later, Jennifer and Ronald met face to face-- and forged an unlikely friendship that changed both of their lives.",
        "In their own words, Jennifer and Ronald unfold the harrowing details of their tragedy, and challenge our ideas of memory and judgment while demonstrating the profound nature of human grace and the healing power of forgiveness."

        "\"Few stories of wrongful convictions have happy endings, but the one told by Ronald Cotton and Jennifer Cannino is far different.  It is the powerful account of violence, rage,redemption, and, ultimately, forgiveness.\"  --John Grisham",
        "“This book will break your heart and lift it up again...a touching and beautiful example of the power of faith and forgiveness. Its message of hope should reverberate far beyond the halls of justice.”--Sr. Helen Prejean, csj, author of",
        "Dead Man Walking",
        "“What happened in this book will change what you think of the criminal justice system in this country, and challenge you to help fix it.  Each of them tells an extraordinary story about crime, punishment and exoneration, but it’s their shared spiritual journey toward reconciliation and forgiveness that is even more compelling and profound.” --Barry C.

        "From The Washington Post",
        "From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Kate Tuttle Nearly everyone in prison protests their innocence, but Ronald Cotton was telling the truth. Cotton was just 22 when he walked into a Burlington, N.C., police station to answer rape allegations; he spent the next 11 years seeking freedom. \"Put a man in a cage with beasts and throw away the key, and it's usually not long before the man is a beast himself,\" he writes in this unusual joint memoir, written with his accuser and now friend, Jennifer Thompson-Cannino. Considering the odds stacked against him -- a bum alibi, a victim focused on being the strongest possible witness, a justice system all too willing to send another young black man to jail -- it's extraordinary that Cotton emerged from prison at all. More stunning still was his willingness, upon exoneration by DNA evidence, to forgive the people who had put him there, including rape victim Thompson-Cannino, whose erroneous identification of Cotton in a police line-up had begun his horrible odyssey. Their story, told here in alternating sections, emphasizes that both were victims. Still, as both acknowledge, Thompson-Cannino, traumatized as she was, spent the next decade in freedom, marrying and having kids, while Cotton endured prison. Left mostly unexamined is the role that race played in his incarceration, but even the most cynical reader will be impressed by Cotton's resilience and grace. Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

        "Prologue",
        "September 2006",
        "Ronald Cotton stands a few rows behind Jennifer Thompson-Cannino, watching as she cranes her head through the crowd, looking for him among the faces of the parents who have come out to watch their children play soccer. All of the fields at Northeast Park in Gibsonville, North Carolina, are occupied on this bright autumn afternoon: It’s tournament day, with a parking lot crammed full of yellow school buses, SUVs, and station wagons to prove it.",
        "\"Where are you?\" she says into her cell phone, unable to find him.",
        "\"I’m right here,\" Ron says, enjoying the joke. Then he reaches out and touches Jennifer’s arm, causing her to turn and jump. \"It’s so good to see you,\" she says, laughing and moving close to embrace him. \"You’d think I would’ve spotted you!\" Wearing a blue baseball hat, Ron at six foot four towers over her. He’s got to lean waay down to hug Jennifer, a tiny blonde with bobbed hair. The sun catches the sterling medallion he always wears around his neck: an eagle in flight.",
        "Ron immediately gets into the game. \"C’mon! Don’t let ’em take that ball!\" he shouts, clapping his hands.",
        "Beside him, Raven, his nine- year- old daughter in neat braids he helped do that morning, shoots him a look. \"Daddy!\"",
        "\"What? Am I embarrassing you?\" She nods, which only makes Ron yell louder. \"Let’s go!\"",
        "He is cheering on Jennifer’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Brittany, who plays center-midfield, the link between offense and defense. Her brown ponytail bopping behind her, she keeps her cleats close to the ball, switch- backing across the field to try to keep it away from the other side until she’s got a clear path to pass it to her fellow players. When she sees her opening, Brittany makes a strong, sure kick and sends the ball to her teammate, who takes off for the goal. The crowd yells for the black and white ball to make it into the net as if nothing could matter more.",
        "The Reds, Brittany’s team, win the first game of the tournament, and then they break for lunch. Brittany, spotting Ron and Raven with her mom, jogs over and hugs them both, happy they are there. The four of them head over with the other parents to the park’s pavilion. With his Burger King bags picked up from the drive- in, Ron isn’t part of the usual soccer parent crowd: moms like Jennifer who unpack neatly prepared sandwiches and snacks from Tupperware and coolers. After the kids eat, Brittany heads off to the grass to show Raven how to kick straight and dribble, while Jennifer and Ron catch up. One nosy mom can’t resist and comes over to say hello.",
        "\"Jennifer, Brittany was just great today!\" she says. \"Too bad your husband missed it. Where is he?\" \"He’s with my son, doing ‘guy stuff,’ but they should be here any minute,\" says Jennifer.",
        "The mother’s eyes dart over to Ron and back to Jennifer. She can’t figure it out. \"So how do y’all know each other?\" the mom says, motioning to Ron.",
        "Jennifer and Ron look at each other, smiling. They let the moment settle between them, hanging in the air like the sweet green smell of freshly cut grass, ready for hordes of high school girls to trample it.",
        "\"We go way back,\" Ron says, in his characteristic way of understating things.",
        "What they don’t say is that twenty- two years ago, Jennifer sat in a jail house just five miles down the interstate, looked at seven black men standing in front of her, and picked Ronald Cotton as the man who had brutally raped her eleven days before.",
