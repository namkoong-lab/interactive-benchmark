        "Don and Cathy Angel have never been apart since that fateful day they met in college. Now in their thirties and pursuing demanding careers in New York City, the two have only grown more closely entwined. Until tragedy strikes . . .   When a hurtling train strikes the couple’s car on a snowy Christmas Eve, Cathy and Don find themselves looking down at their mangled gray Beamer—and their own bodies inside. Neither fully in this world or the next, they learn that in order to move on, they must perform six miracles before midnight. But with no experience in the field of divine intervention, both are convinced their mission can only end in disaster . . .   But on this sparkling, silent night, these two reluctant angels will discover that there is no greater gift than the one we are all blessed to give: the gift of love . . .",
