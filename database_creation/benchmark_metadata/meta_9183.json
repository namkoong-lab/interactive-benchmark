        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 8 Up—DK, in consultation with the Smithsonian Institution, delivers a hefty tome that provides a sweeping overview of the Vietnam War. Informational spreads containing color photographs take readers more or less chronologically through the saga of the war, from Indochina's precolonial history to the region's current situation. Most of the spreads focus on specific events or aspects of the war, such as \"The Tonkin Gulf Incident\" and \"The African American Experience,\" while some feature biographies, eyewitness accounts, time lines, selections of artifacts and weaponry, and full-bleed images. The presentation of content, in particular, the clear and consistent subject headings and iconography, aids reader comprehension. Especially useful are the \"before\" and \"after\" panels accompanying each topic, which assist readers in connecting the topic at hand to previous and upcoming sections. The material is broad and inclusive and takes a critical approach to all parties involved, despite the book's self-proclaimed American lens. The layout, table of contents, index, and acknowledgements section citing sources for the hundreds of photographs make the volume easily navigable. There are a few factual errors, such as an incorrect statement of the scope of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. However, this is overall a solid resource. VERDICT Strongly recommended for young military enthusiasts, readers seeking to gain a broad understanding of the war, and those conducting research.—Darla Salva Cruz, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY",
