        "Meet Me Under The Eiffel Tower is Tasha Donahue's frank, revealing and outrageously entertaining memoir about rediscovering herself in the madcap, anything-goes environment of Paris. Her marriage was long over, her love life vapid, her grown children endlessly exasperating. Together, with a fallen economy, it was enough to make Mother Teresa depressed. But she is no Mother Teresa. Her frank encounters regarding sex, the craziness of dating at mid-life and the bold honesty with which she approaches her life will captivate the reader. This is more than the author’s sexual memoirs told with wit and insight. It is about the importance of regaining balance in life, about embracing one’s multi-dimensionality and living a rich, full life. It introduces the benefits of nitric oxide and links pleasure with spirituality. Is there such a thing as too much fun? The author resolves to start anew. By the time her adventures are over in Paris, she recaptures her femininity and finds her joie de vivre. Tasha fills her account with insight and humor. Behind it all is a poignant message for all women who are confronting emptiness and depression or suffering from imbalance in their lives. With courage and determination it is possible to restore the vitality and pizzazz that seem missing. Why merely survive when you can do more? Meet Me Under The Eiffel Tower is one woman's account of how she actually did it. Reviews: “…[The author’s] honesty is refreshing and her experiences keep you turning the pages. This is a book to lay back and savor, since once started it is hard to put down…” Judith Habert, San Diego Woman Magazine “Meet Me Under The Eiffel Tower is a well written snapshot of time in the life of a divorced woman looking to regain her balance in life. It is a great reading escape to be paired with a glass of fine wine and a fireplace!” Vince Meehan, Mission Valley News"

        "About the Author",
        "Tasha Donahue has published all of her life as a food editor, wine, travel and family issues writer and columnist. She hosted and produced a seven part television series. Donahue is proudly addicted to foreign film and chocolate. She lives happily in southern California. Donahue admits she has lived an eclectic life that has led to a kaleidoscope of experiences from being a missionary to finding herself a young lover in Paris . These memoirs are of a secular nature. Donahue is a cheerleader to women who reach forty-five, become grandmothers or divorce. Her message is told with no holds barred: live life fully each and every day. Finally comfortable with her multi-dimensionality, she has decided to share some of her memoirs describing how she got to that place of contentment. The experiences include women's issues, lovers, sex, Paris, travel and the ability to grow and thrive with all things that come her way. Donahue visited Paris nine times, living there the last time for six months. If it could happen it probably did happen to her. So, if you are up for it, grab a glass of vin and sit down for an insightful and fun read as seen through her eyes. In other words be inspired."
