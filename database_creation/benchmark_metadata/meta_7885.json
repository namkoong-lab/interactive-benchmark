        "The latest Hammer's Slammers book consists of three novellas flying in close formation. Together they are the adventures of Lieutenant (later Captain) Arnie Huber, a combat-car leader when the Slammers land on Plattner's World to fight over the price of a key ingredient for geriatric drugs. \"Choosing Sides,\" in which Huber learned to do dirty tricks, first appeared in",

        "[BKL My 1 02], alongside novellas by David Weber and Eric Flint; \"The Political Process\" and \"Neck or Nothing\" each take Huber on desperate missions against potential treachery and the superior forces of other mercenaries. The weaponry, the action scenes, and the depiction of the Warrior Walking Alone are as vivid and compelling as Drake's readers expect them to be, and his realization of characters and political intrigue continue to mature. The Slammers may be one of the longest-serving units in military sf, but they are no longer, as they sometimes seemed to be, more of the same old same old.",
