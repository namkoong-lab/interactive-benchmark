        "1:72 Scale Diecast Metal - F4U Corsair VF-17 \"Jolly Rogers\" US NAVY 1944 – Length: 5.5\" Wingspan: 6.75” This Corsair model is a single seat plane. The cockpit is glue shut. It has no pilot/crew figures included. The landing gear is optional, the pieces for the landing gear will need a little glue to be kept in place. The landing gear can be made to look in the retracted position (in flight) with the optional pieces. A display stand is included. This is really a \"no-play\" model or a \"display-only\" model. It is mostly metal and very heavy. It also has a number of antennas which look great but are very fragile. The box is labeled as not suitable for children under 14."
