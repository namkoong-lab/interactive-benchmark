        "\"Awesome read. Characters and storyline are awesome. Widow lives close to her mother-in-law and her mother-in-law pays for her daughter to go to a real fancy school. Maybe not so fancy. The daughter sees a dead teacher along with a couple friends. Her mother decided to \"help\" investigate and so much happens. A definite must read. -- The MommaThis was a very enjoyable and entertaining, funny read. Mystery, suspense, thrills and a whole lot of laughter with a really good story thrown in. - Kindle CustomerAs usual I loved the continuation of the (in her mind only) love affair Kiki enjoyed with Detweiler. Evidently there is every kind of crazy at CALA and being Old St Louis isn't all it has been cracked up to be. Was surprised to find out that KKK was alive and prospering in Missouri. All this while murder and scrapbooking continues to infiltrate Kiki's life. Bring on the next book!!!--Lee L.I have read these books out of order but I still love them.",

        "maintains the high quality of character and plot that is the hallmark of all of Joanna Campbell Slan's works. Watching the evolution of Kiki's relationships is my favorite part of the series. The mystery is as intriguing as the others I have read and there were too many reasonable suspects for me to feel like I had figured it out early. When your child is not safe at school, your life takes a serious turn. - Jeanie J.",
        "From the Author",
        "This is the only book I've ever written where someone threatened me when they heard about the book. (When you read this, you'll probably guess the organization that the thug represented.) Honestly! (Ugh. It still makes me feel a little sick.) People try to pawn off revisionist history, and that's counter-productive. The better story is that organizations evolve. In this case, the organization in question has moved beyond its past and stepped into a brighter, more equitable future that they can be justifiably proud of.",

        "bestselling author Joanna Campbell Slan was born in Florida but grew up in a small town in Indiana. She and her sisters often walked to the public library, and it was there, in the pages of books, that Joanna found a way to escape from their unhappy family life. According to her mother, her nose \"was always in a book.\" Joanna dreamed of being an author. She put herself through college (Ball State University) as a journalism major while working full-time in a pet shop! After graduation, she held positions at a variety of newspapers and eventually worked in public relations and taught it at Illinois State University. In fact, she wrote scripts for the first FarmAid and won a Silver Anvil (PRSA's Emmy) for her work. She married David Slan, and they have one son, Michael, who is married to Chelsea Edwards. The Slans live on Jupiter Island, Florida, with their Havanese pup, Jax. When she isn't writing, Joanna is crafting. She's a Certified Teacher of Zentangle, an award-winning miniaturist, and a pretty crummy artist. (But she doesn't care.)",
