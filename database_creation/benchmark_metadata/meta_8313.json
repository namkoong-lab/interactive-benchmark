        "When considered in a broader social context, The Clash stand as one of the most important musical acts in rock history. Original punks who transcended the music’s minimalist origins, The Clash lived and breathed the idea that they could change the world with their art. In The Clash: The Only Band That Mattered, respected music critic Sean Egan examines The Clash’s career and art through the prism of the uniquely interesting and fractious UK politics of the 1970s and ’80s, without which they simply would not have existed. Tackling such subjects as The Clash’s self-conscious tussles with their record label, the accusations of selling out that dogged their footsteps, their rivalry with the similarly leaning but less purist Jam, the paradoxical quality of their achieving multiplatinum success, and even whether their denunciations of Thatcherism were proven wrong, Egan has come up with new insights into a much discussed group. Clash fans, Clash haters, social historians, and political students will all find themselves entertained by his thought-provoking conclusions."

        "Review",
        "Economic decay in Britain during the 1970s and the overt commercialization of rock led to the creation of punk rock, and no punk band enjoyed as much critical acclaim as the Clash. The Sex Pistols may have attracted most of the controversy, but the Clash, led by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Joe Strummer and vocalist and lead guitarist Mick Jones, was in a category by itself. Literate and angry, the Clash combined potent street poetry and powerful rhythms to create politically charged songs with a strong leftist ideology that attacked class warfare, nuclear annihilation, and generational ennui. It thought it could change the world with such songs. Egan chronicles the history of the 'only band that mattered,' offering intelligent commentary on individual songs. Although the Clash disbanded in 1986, and Strummer died in 2002, the Clash remains an influential band—Billy Bragg, Bono, Green Day, and the White Stripes are among their musical offspring—and several of their albums are considered iconic works in the rock canon. ―",
        "Booklist",
        "Here [is a] heady book about [the] punk music legend the Clash, who, though beloved by fans and critics, eschewed 'mainstream' success. [The] author gets at the root of that independence and intentionality in slightly different ways. The Clash . . . demonstrates what many other authors have failed to do: that the Clash’s intelligent, working-man’s music provided an outlet for a groundswell of the punk generation’s intellectual rebelliousness. . . .VERDICT [This] title [is a] fine purchase for large public libraries and deep music collections; for an intriguing take on punk history. ―",
        "Library Journal",
        "As rock history/analysis tomes go, The Clash: The Only Band That Mattered is essential reading. For those who don’t especially appreciate The Clash but who would like a better understanding of the society and economy of Margaret Thatcher-era Britain, the book is equally highly recommended. ―",
