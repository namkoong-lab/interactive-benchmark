        "Did the invisible hand of God fashion the United States? Is this Hand still active today?While most Americans know the story of how the United States won its independence, many are unaware of George Washington’s passionate assertion that God was intrinsically involved in the nation’s founding.“ No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.”—GEORGE WASHINGTONWashington’s belief about the many signs, mercies, and favorable interventions of God during the founding of America inspired Visibly Struck, a mesmerizing novel based on the true experiences of George Washington and his faith in the invisible hand of God protecting him and fashioningthe country.“ Visibly Struck gives the reader a new and inspiring way of thinking about the founding of the United States.”—JOE CALLOWAY, author of Be the Best at What Matters Most“ An unprecedented examination of the steps and guiding forces behind perhaps the greatest of our founding fathers.

        "Visibly Struck Reviewed By Norm Goldman of Bookpleasures.comThe night Papa had his stroke, he was really angry. He read something to me from Washington's Inaugural Address about God's invisible hand shaping America, and he was really angry that the same hand didn't save my parents,\" Aspen explains in Steve Kubicek's novel, Visibly Struck.At three hundred and sixty pages, this paperback book is targeted toward readers who enjoy historical fiction with a blend of time traveling to the beginning of the United States of America and dealing with the premature loss of loved ones. With no profanity or sexual scenes, there is wartime violence that includes killing along with scalping by Indians.In this progressive tome, Stephen \"Spitz\" Spitzen used to love God. But all that changed seventeen years ago when his only son and daughter-in-law were killed in a fiery plane crash and then his wife died, leaving him to take care of his young granddaughter, Aspen.Now a young adult finance professional, Aspen loves her Papa dearly, even though he has become bitter, challenging God on why He took his wife and family years ago. Venting his anger, the avid historian of George Washington pursues his new \"case study\" to prove that God was not involved in the founding of our country.When Spitz has a stroke and succumbs to a coma, he is repeatedly transported through a tunnel of lights back in time to witness Washington as major, lieutenant colonel, general, and president. Not allowed to alter history, Spitz observes and journals the signs, mercies, and interventions directed to Washington by the Almighty.With a plethora of meticulous research, Washington and others' quotes and letters are weaved throughout the dialogue to confirm the great man's dependence, devotion, and reliance on God. From the Virginia frontier to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania and Trenton, New Jersey to track war battles, family deaths, and personal relationships of our first president, Spitz must come to terms that God is in control and knows all, protecting with His love, mercy, and grace.While Spitz fights for his life both in the past and present, Aspen must also come to terms on where and how God is directing her, especially when it concerns her new business partner.With an over-whelming historical background, bullet points of Spitz's well-founded observations, a recapitulation of the time-traveling at the end, and detailed endnotes, readers easily become caught up with seeing God's invisible hand in each human's life, perhaps reflecting on their own.Reviewed by Karen Pirnot for Readers' Favorite 01/30/2014Visibly Struck by author Steve Kubicek is an interesting study of one man's near obsession with the history of George Washington as it relates to Washington's career in the military and as a founding father. The story features Stephen \"Spitz\" Spitzen, the grandfather of Aspen Spitzen. All was well until Spitz's only son and his daughter-in-law met a fiery death in a plane accident. Spitz immediately became angry and filled with rage that God would do such a thing to him and his granddaughter Aspen. Spitz had researched the life and times of General/President Washington for years and was now a disbeliever that God had played an invisible hand in the formation of the United States of America. When Spitz is struck down by a stroke and ends up in a comatose state, he travels back in time and sees first-hand the kind of man that helped to form the nation. He is present with Washington in his move through military ranks and then, as the first President of the new nation. He gains insight as to the intent of Washington's letters and he then ponders the true role of God in the formation of the new nation.There is considerable research in Visibly Struck and Kubicek has obviously grounded his tale on Washington's own writings, making the novel somewhat factually-based. I did find the character development a bit lacking as I had hoped that more of Spitz's true and agonizing transition would be revealed. However, Kubicek does take Biblical scriptures and juxtaposes them to the chronology of events leading to the birth of the United States; this in itself leads to a fascinating weaving of history, belief and happenstance. Skeptics may not be totally convinced but believers will feel a sense of validation from the novel.By Laura Davis on December 18, 2013Visibly Struck by author Steve Kubicek is the fictional account of the true experiences of George Washington about his faith in the invisible hand of God.Stephen Spitzen (or Spitz) is a 21st century man who used to have a strong faith in God. But his heart grew cold and bitter toward Him when his son and daughter in-law were killed in a plane crash while serving as missionaries overseas. The responsibility of raising their young daughter fell to him and while Aspen grew into a young woman who trusted God, she could not get her grandfather to do the same. When Spitz suffers a stroke, he is thrown back in time and meets George Washington, where he comes to see how faith in God guided Washington through every facet of his life.If you like historical fiction and time travel, you will enjoy this book. The author has taken Washington's actual words and used them to create a book that clearly shows how his faith helped form a new nation. The characters were very well developed and the book, while fictional, clearly shows how much God played a part in forming America. I am not American and I enjoyed reading this bit about their history. It gave me time to ponder the formation of my own country (Canada). While Washington's faith greatly encouraged me, it was, at the same time, a sobering reminder on how little our nation's (mine included) disregard God now.This is a great read. It is informative and will get you thinking and will prove to all doubters that yes-America was founded on Christian values. I give it 5/5 stars!Harriet KlausnerReviewed November 11, 2013Seventeen years ago, historian Stephen Spitzen's son and daughter-in-law died in a plane crash. Soon after that his wife passed away. As a single \"dad,\" Spitz raised his beloved granddaughter Aspen while ranting at God for taking away his other loved ones.Years after her parents died, financier Aspen loves her Papa but worries about his health as his anger towards God consumes Spitz. Deciding to prove that the Founding Fathers were not influenced by Christianity; Spitz hypothesizes that George Washington and the others did not trust in God when they created the United States. However, Spitz suffers a stroke that leaves him in a coma and Aspen praying for divine intervention. In his comatose state, Spitz travels back in time to observe Washington in two wars as an officer and eventually as the first president of this new experiment.Using time travel by a twenty-first century deity denier, Visibly Struck is an enjoyable historical. The storyline enables the reader to better understand George Washington through the experiences of the Father of Our Country as a soldier and a statesman, and his writings that argue in his strong \"Faith in the Invisible Hand of God.\" Although the wealth of information gives the storyline a nonfictional feel at times, readers will appreciate this enjoyable different perspective of the founding of America.",
