        "LiteRays LED projection LitePods project 7 different dazzling colors: red, green, blue, light yellow, Cyan, pink and white. There is also a multimode color changing setting where the glass will slowly phase through all of the colors automatically. Simply push down on the pod to cycle through each color setting. This particular model projects a stripes themed pattern all around the base of the pod. It runs on 2 common CR2032 batteries which are easily replaceable by removing the 2 screws and pulling away the silicone cover from the electronics. LiteRays are best enjoyed in a low light or dark environment. Each pod comes with its own 'sticky pad' which can be adhered easily to any smooth flat surface, such as a wall, cabinets, or as most use them for; the bottom of a drinking glass. Best of all, the sticky pad can be cleaned and reused, so there is never a need to buy replacements. Simply remove the sticky pad from the pod and run it under warm water to wash away dust and particulates. For drinking glasses, these pods work best with libby 16oz style glasses or pilsners. They measure just under 2.5 inches across, so with all of the styles of glasses available there is a large multitude of possibilities. Please note while LiteRays LitePods are water resistant, they are NOT water proof. Hand wash with a slightly damp cloth only! What are the uses for LiteRays LitePods? The possibilities are largely limited to your imagination but here are just a few helpful suggestions: - Use as a wedding plate centerpiece with candy inside or a small flower - Use as a child's bedside night light - Use a party or mood lighting - Use as a light source inside a glass vase or center piece - Use as a name place holders at a dinner party - Use as a patio lighting accessory This product can be customized with customer supplied images and/or text! Contact us for details. Make your next special event a unique and memorable one with LiteRays projection LitePods!"
