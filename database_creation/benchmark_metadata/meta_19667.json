Combining open-eyed historical research, state-of-the-art equipment and high-tech expeditions, each episode examines the best evidence available, from pictures and video, to hair and bones, to actual eyewitness accounts.MOVIE MONSTER episodes include: Jaws In IllinoisSwamp StalkerAmerican WerewolfVampires in America"
