        "This latest release from DaWayCo publishing entitled Between Earth and Sky showcases over 40 of Daniel Coburn's thought provoking images. His black and white photographs are stunningly reproduced and presented without distraction. Kansas arts advocate Don Lambert describes Coburn s work eloquently while conveying his own passions for the preservation of the Kansas Landscape. Daniel Coburn began his creative journey as a simple observer and a witness to the awesome power and beauty of nature. As his work evolved he began to focus on the impact of a human presence on the landscape. Focused on the commercial, industrial, and agricultural use of lands throughout Kansas, Coburn's images are infused with genuine concern, emotion and respect for the environment. Coburn stresses that his images are very seldom a literal representation of a place or event rather his own artistic interpretation of the scene. Each photograph is deliberate in its form and message. Seeking out man-made structures and incursions, he creates dynamic compositions that beautifully combine the artifacts of a human impact with the looming presence of nature. He concentrates on contrast, lighting and form searching for a unique landscape that truly lends itself to the black and white media. Through these works Daniel urges people to tread lightly, and proceed with caution as we find our place in this world somewhere between earth and sky."

        "In Daniel Coburn's landscapes bales of hay appear like totems abandoned by an ancient civilization, clouds roil through the sky with hidden purpose, a plowed path snakes through a snow-covered field like a mighty river. These landscapes are alive with light. --- Stephen Perloff - Editor of The Photo Review - A Critical Journal of PhotographyDan's images hover between the real and the magical. You get the feeling he's intimately linked to the land -- that he's got a direct tie to Nature who lets him know when She's about to perform her next magestic drama. Beautiful work! ---Nine Francois - Fine Art Photographer, Professor, Austin Community College.Coburn has really tuned-in to the landscape. His images embody a vision of preservation and beauty. --D. Clarke Evans - President of the Texas Photographic Society",
        "About the Author",
        "Daniel Coburn began his creative journey as a witness to the awesome power and beauty of nature. As his work has evolved, he's begun to focus on the impact of a human presence on the landscape. Many of his photographs capture instances where man-made structures and incursions exist in visual harmony with the earth. Coburn s photographs are seldom a literal representation of the scene, rather his own artistic interpretation of events. Through these works he urges people to tread lightly, and proceed with caution as we find our place amongst nature. Coburn's photographs have garnered national and international recognition, appearing in prestigious exhibitions across the United States. He was a recipient of the the 2007 Artist-In-Residence award at Rocky Mountain National Park. In 2008 he served as president of the Lawrence Photo Alliance, an organization dedicated to the proliferation of photography and photographic artists in the midwest. Coburn is a recipient of the 2008 Kansas Mid-Career Artist Fellowship awarded by the Kansas Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts. His photography appears regularly in regional and national publications and his images have been featured in Camera Arts Magazine."
