        "Bel Ami is a gay film studio with offices in Bratislava, Prague and Budapest. It was established in 1993 by filmmaker George Duroy, a Slovak native who took his pseudonym from the protagonist Georges Duroy in Guy de Maupassant's novel Bel Ami. In addition to DVDs, Bel Ami and Bruno Gmünder Verlag also produce calendars and photo books, and its performers are frequent headliners at nightclubs and similar venues around Europe, the United States and elsewhere."
