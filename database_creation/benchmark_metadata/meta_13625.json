        "Orthotic walking shoes are the perfect companion for women who enjoy daily walks at home or while on vacation, seeing sights both indoors and outdoors. Vionic walking shoes come in all different styles and colors. These sporty casual sneakers allow you to walk in comfort with slip-on convenience, performance, and a fit that works for your feet. Feel like a champion while taking care of your feet and avoid the pain associated with plantar fasciitis and other painful foot conditions. Experience the joy of walking with no limits! We recommend wearing your new Vionic sneakers for short periods of time over the first week or two so your feet can adjust to the new level of orthotic relief they’re experiencing. There’s a science to our style: Vionic shoes have Three-Zone Comfort technology which delivers stability, cushioning, and ultimate arch support via podiatrist-developed contours that are seamlessly designed into each and every pair.
