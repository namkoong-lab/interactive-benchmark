        "From Library Journal",
        "This highly personal visual chronicle offers photos never seen before and short reminiscences by members of the 166th Signal Photo Company of the 89th Division of Patton's 3rd Army, taking an up-close look at a unit assigned to photograph the most photographed war of its time. The lack of maps means that readers may have some trouble following the vivid action as the text jumps from D-day to Paris to Germany and then Prague, but the images need no precise coordinates; they are as universal as the accounts are captivating. Recommended for most libraries.",
