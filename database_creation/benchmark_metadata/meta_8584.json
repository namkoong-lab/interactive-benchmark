        "began working in children's publishing more years ago than she cares to remember and is now Editorial Director at Caterpillar Books. As an editor, she has worked on titles ranging from atlases to animal pop-ups, craft kits to crazy mazes, and sticker books to secret diaries.",
        "Summer Macon",
        "was raised in an itty bitty town of Southern NM. As a child, she quickly became known as \"Tiger\" as this is how she would sign her homework next to the many doodles covering their pages. She has decided to now go by her real name and lives in an even smaller itty bitty town (population 32) in beautiful Colorado. In the summertime you can find her rock climbing, mountain biking, or doodling on her contracts."
