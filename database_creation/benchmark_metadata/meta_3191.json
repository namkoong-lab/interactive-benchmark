        "Belgium has a long tradition of chocolate making. Belgian chocolate couverture and baking chocolate are characteristically more buttery, medium sweet with medium bitterness.",
        "Chocolatiers think of Belgian chocolates as being in the middle range of flavor profile with not too much of a range in flavor extremes. Belgian milk chocolate for example has a classic milk flavor and not so much fruitiness or sourness you might find in other milk chocolate varieties. Belgian dark chocolate will have a classic fudge like earthy flavor and no sourness, fruitiness or lingering floral flavors usually. The popularity of the Belgian chocolate taste is because it is comforting and forward without too many distractions. This classic taste is derived from the unique African cacao companies in Belgium source as an ingredient. West African cacao, the type Belgian chocolatiers use, is world famous for having a classic cocoa taste. This straightforward taste is the cornerstone of the chocolate. Probably the most famous Belgian chocolates found in the USA come from the chocolatier Neuhaus. Maker of the classic solid chocolate bar and moulded shape Belgian chocolates, Neuhaus chocolatier is the perfect example of traditional European chocolate making.",
