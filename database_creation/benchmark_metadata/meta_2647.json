        "AN EASTERN SHORE SKETCHBOOK is a loving look at the lower Eastern Shore of Virginia. For those who live there or have visited there, you’ll recognize many of the people and places. For those who have not, I hope you will be able to read the SKETCHBOOK, find amusement and enjoyment in its reflections, and perhaps transfer some of that to memories deeply seated in your minds of your special place. So much has changed on the Eastern Shore over the years. And yet everything remains the same. That’s the beauty of The Eastern Shore, at least the Lower Shore. It is a way of life that has been proven by time and tradition. It shows that you can be surrounded by the manic bustle of modern life, but still remain gentle and genteel. It shows that there can be things more important than a dollar – like history and tradition and manners and civility and friends and a tried and true way of country life. Those of us who look to the Lower Shore as an anchor or normalcy in our frantic rat race lives can only pray that the forces of development (development does not necessarily equal progress) and the quest for the almighty dollar do not ultimately destroy what for now is such a joy."
