        "Across America and around the world, in cities and suburbs and small towns, people from all walks of life are redefining our “lifespaces”—the way we live and who we live with. The traditional nuclear family in their single-family home on a suburban lot has lost its place of prominence in contemporary life. Today, Americans have more choices than ever before in creating new ways to live and meet their personal needs and desires. Social scientist, researcher, and writer Bella DePaulo has traveled across America to interview people experimenting with the paradigm of how we live. In",

Through personal interviews and stories, media accounts, and in-depth research,",

I'm a 60-something year old and I have always been single. I love my single life. But I do not love all of the ridiculous assumptions people make about me when they first meet me and learn that I am single. (No, I do not spend my evenings crying in my beer.) I'm also a social scientist (with a PhD in social psychology from Harvard). I write about singles with a passion. My work on this topic (and others) has appeared in publications such as the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Washington Post, Time magazine, and many others. There have been feature stories in Psychology Today and the AARP magazine. I've also been on the Today show and other morning shows, CNN, NPR, and many others. I've written op-eds for publications such as the New York Times, Newsday, the San Francisco Chronicle, Forbes, and the Chronicle of Higher Education. I have been a visiting professor of psychology at UC Santa Barbara since 2000. I think that makes me a permanent visitor. Get in touch if you would like to hire me to speak at your event.\", 'My first book on singles was \"Singled Out: How Singles Are Stereotyped, Stigmatized, and Ignored, and Still Live Happily Ever After.\" My second is a collection of 89 essays, \"Single with Attitude: Not Your Typical Take on Health and Happiness, Love and Money, Marriage and Friendship.\" After that, I published \"Singlism: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How to Stop It,\" then \"The Best of Single Life,\" and most recently, \"Marriage vs. Single Life: How Science and the Media Got It So Wrong\" and \"The Science of Marriage: What We Know That Just Isn\\'t So.\"', 'I am also an expert on the social psychology of lying. I wrote a short book, \"Behind the Door of Deceit: Understanding the Biggest Liars in Our Lives.\" I also published a collection of professional papers, \"The Lies We Tell and the Clues We Miss\" and a number of other deception books after that.', 'In August 2015, my new book will be published by Beyond Words, a partner imprint of Simon & Schuster. It is \"How We Live Now: Redefining Home and Family in the 21st Century.\"', 'You can read more about all of my work on my website, www.BellaDePaulo.com.']}"
