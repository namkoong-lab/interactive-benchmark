        "Kate Reading seems like an odd choice to narrate a story about grim barbarians who are fighting a war in a magical age. Yet it quickly becomes clear that she's the perfect choice to read CAPTAIN'S FURY, the fourth book of the Codex Alera series. Somehow she sounds as natural as the voice of an elfin magician as she does delivering the voice of a barbarian warlord. The long and complicated story involves a world in which people have bound themselves to forces of nature, such as the wind, which aid them in eternal battle. In this book, a young leader realizes that the only way for his world to survive is to persuade everyone to do something they've never done���put down their swords.
