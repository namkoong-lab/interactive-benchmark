    "description": [
        "Tulle was named for the city of Tulle, France where is was first made. According to Italian Tulle, the French began knitting a hexagonal mesh fabric around 1700. In 1840, Queen Victoria's wedding gown featured tulle for the first time, forever linking the fabric to bridal fashion. It's lightweight and has a small mesh effect. This item is perfect for bridal dresses and veils. It also can accent corsages or provide decorative filler for gift baskets. Gardeners use tulle to protect plants from insects or to shield berries from rodents and birds. Interior designers incorporate tulle into window treatments or bed curtains to create a soft feminine look."
