Woe begins to have both physical and emotional symptoms of stress, and yet is scared to share his new anxious feelings with others. While attempting to cover up his true feelings, Woe must face his own fears along with a crew of anxiety-provoking creatures, including a frigidly nasty creature called, The Icemaker!
