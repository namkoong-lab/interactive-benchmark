        "The Cedar Waxwing (pg. 133) has a small dark bill. The female Northern Cardinal appears similar to juvenile Cardinal, but the juvenile has a dark bill. Look for female’s bright red bill.",
        "Stan’s Notes:",
        "A familiar backyard bird. Look for male feeding female during courtship. Male feeds young of first brood by himself while female builds a second nest. Their name comes from the Latin word",
        "cardinalis",
        ", which means “important.” Very territorial during spring, it will fight its own reflection in a window. Non-territorial in winter, they gather in small flocks of up to 20 birds. Both male and female sing and can be heard any time of year. Listen for their “whata-cheer-cheer-cheer” territorial call in spring.",
