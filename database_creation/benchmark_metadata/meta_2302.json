        "The Baseball Player's Guide To Hitting Like A Pro",
        "is a short but complete book that covers both the physics and psychology of the baseball game. It's more on the psychology side, though, since Linsgter explains how mental focus is the key to effective hitting in the batter's box. In seven chapters, the author teaches the fundamentals of becoming a good hitter in baseball. These include the mechanics of hitting and the mental power of striking effectively. In each chapter, the author illustrates his key points by examples from the performance of famous hitters, showing where they went wrong and what they did to fix it. Readers also learn about the struggles of some legendary baseball hitters in the game and how they overcame the challenges by making important adjustments to perfect their swing. The book underscores the central role of mental clarity and concentration in getting the best out of the bat at the plate. An interesting and important chapter (No. 4) discusses the importance of anticipating the kind of pitch coming at the hitter; in other words, how to think like a pitcher in order to have a clear idea of what you will be hitting next. There is a fair amount of baseball history in the book, both about the game and about players who rose to national and international fame. Quotes from veteran players on maximizing performance and a set of questions for hitters in each chapter add to the educational value of the lessons in",

        ". With its immense educational value coming from a seasoned baseball instructor, this book also has great motivational power to encourage those hitters who suffer from self-doubt after a series of bad performances in the field. Stories of some of the celebrated players making a comeback after setbacks in the game convey the message of hope for success in future. As someone with little knowledge of baseball, this reviewer learnt a lot about the game and its spirit from Lingster's easy-to-understand and to-the-point instructions on how to improve one's performance in the field. This book makes a great introductory course for new and struggling baseball hitters as well as for students of the game. Anyone interested in sports psychology will also enjoy reading",

        "From the Author",
        "No one knows better about the difficulties of stepping up to the plate and facing your batting demons like the author.Having struggled at the plate in his own playing time is what prompted Roy Lingster to write this book. Twenty-five years in the game as a player and coach included a trip to the Little League World Series in 2007. It also included a season where he experienced his worst year at the plate ending with a .180 batting average. Haunted by that performance going into a new season, he knew he needed to make some kind of adjustment not to repeat that. He was unwilling to accept the idea that his talents suddenly disappeared. He set about breaking down the elements of how to achieve success at the dish. The effort to get his mind back on his game let him beat the setback and excel.The students of the game are the teachers for the talent of tomorrow. Roy learned to put that miserable .180 season behind with determination to take responsibility for his turn at the plate. He is here to teach you about hitting and to help you learn through the valuable lessons he fought to find. You have to look no further than this book to improve your performance. You'll hear about all the possibilities you have to improve your approach with specific calls to action that let you know what steps to take and how to apply what you learn. When you are done, you will recognize how to help people around you and become the teacher yourself.While the batter may be alone while he stands at the dish, he isn't alone in his pursuit of becoming an excellent batsman. Now it is your turn to step up, improve your performance, and become a true student of the game.",

He has spent 25 years in the game as both player and coach, but his interest in sports has led him to branch out into basketball and football. The expertise he’s built throughout his career is evident in his writing, and his books provide a rich source of information and advice for sports enthusiasts who want to learn the history behind their game and develop their skills at the same time.', 'Roy’s journey may have begun with baseball, but when he began writing about exceptional stories, he uncovered fascinating tales behind every sport, and the books seemed to write themselves. His research has informed his technique and coaching style, and he’s fascinated by how developing knowledge in one sport can lead to greatness in another.', 'Roy has a drive for helping others overcome their setbacks and achieve their dreams, which stems from battling with a setback of his own. His commitment to overcoming this and getting his mind back in the game saw him break down the elements of how to achieve success in baseball, and he’s now passionate about sharing everything he’s learned with others.', 'Roy lives in the Netherlands, where he spends most of his time soaking up anything to do with sport.']}"
