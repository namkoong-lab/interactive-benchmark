As his elevated position brings him from one home to another, he increasingly discovers the importance of what he sees disappearing.",

        "Review",
        "\"Goran has produced what we look for in fiction -- a whole world. This novel will be compared to the work of William Kennedy. But it seems that Goran should be linked more to Don DeLillo, another magician who can produce, all of a piece, what John Cheever called 'the enduring past.'\" -Ambrose Clancy,",
