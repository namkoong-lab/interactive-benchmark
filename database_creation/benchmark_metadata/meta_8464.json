        "The Three Edwards: War and State in England, 1272",
        "is a masterly overview to this eventful and fascinating period of history. It analyses the three Kings of very different qualities and reputations: the confident and masterful Edward I who conquered Wales; Edward II who was defeated by the Scots in battle and was humiliated and deposed; and Edward III whose reign saw great triumphs against the French, but also the terrible ravages of plague. The second edition of this highly acclaimed book updates the picture throughout, in the light of recent research."

The son of Oxford historians, it was perhaps inevitable that he studied at Oxford University for his first degree and his doctorate. His first job was at the University of St Andrews, where there was a highly successful department of medieval history. He moved to the University of Durham in 1979, and taught there until he retired, by which time it had rebranded itself as Durham University. In the 1990s he served as pro-vice-chancellor, with a range of responsibilities from research to health and safety. He began his own research with work on Edward I, and his publications have concentrated on thirteenth and fourteenth century England in most of its aspects, with a particular emphasis on war and its impact on government and society. He is married, with three children and what seems like a lot of grandchildren. He was awarded an OBE in 2010.']}"
