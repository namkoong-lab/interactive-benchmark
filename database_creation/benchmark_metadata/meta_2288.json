        "...The stars were waiting for us, stretched across the heavens like a school of flickering bait fish, silver and breathtaking in their midnight blue sea. We watched, as if waiting for a sign. “Did you know,” I whispered reverently, “that my Destiny as a Reader was written in the stars? Do you believe in predestination? That some things were just meant to be from the beginning of time?”... One strange encounter and a split-second decision results in Jasmine Blade’s safe structured life becoming a whirlwind of risk, intrigue and pushing the boundaries of scientific discovery. Now a simple blow into a child’s bubble wand can release hundreds of spheres containing the essence of any given emotion and the world is introduced to the concept of ‘emotional warfare’.But manipulating emotions is a dangerous game, and the Council of Carriers, Framers and Readers have hidden plans for Jasmines groundbreaking formula. If she is to fulfill her calling to be a ‘Reader’, Jasmine needs to identify who is friend and who is foe, all the while juggling personal destiny with the things in life that really matter. Music matters. Family matters. Purpose matters. Trust matters. Good overcoming evil defiantly matters. But above all, love matters, and fortunately for Jasmine, love and destiny are about to collide. But what price has destiny put on her head, and does she have the emotional strength to pay it – or will someone else have to count the cost on Jasmines’ behalf?"
