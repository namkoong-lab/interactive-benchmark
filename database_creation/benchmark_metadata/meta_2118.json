        ", Leigh Calvez pursues 11 different owl species—including the Barred, Flammulated, Northern Saw-Whet, Northern Pygmy, Northern Spotted, Burrowing, Snowy, and Great Gray. In an entertaining and accessible style, Calvez relays the details of her avian studies, from the thuggish behavior of barred owls—which puts the spotted owl at risk—to the highly unusual appearance of arctic snowy owls in the Lower 48, which directly reflects the state of the vole population in the Arctic.   As Calvez takes readers into the lives of these strange and majestic creatures, she also explores questions about the human-animal connection, owl obsession, habitat, owl calls, social behavior, and mythology. Hoot!"

She has also led extended whale watching journeys to New Zealand, British Columbia and the Azores Islands off Portugal.', 'Her interest in the natural world led her to nature writing. Leigh wrote about her adventures in the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, and the story was published in American Nature Writing: 2003 by Fulcrum Books. Her writing about her work with dolphins was published in an anthology for Sierra Club Books entitled Between Species: Celebrating the Dolphin-Human Bond. Her work has also been published in The Ecologist, Ocean Realm, The Christian Science Monitor, the Seattle Times, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
