        "An award-winning educator and author of many math storybooks for children grades two to eight, Burns explains her teaching approach by example, presenting her ideas as classroom scenarios and conversations. She believes that children learn math concepts best by trying to apply them to ambiguous, real-life situations. She also argues that \"anything known about how children learn was ignored once our school math learning began.\" Her book is like a role-playing game for math teachers. Rather than presenting specific lesson plans or educational games, Burns illustrates a style of teaching that encourages children to discover mathematical concepts by themselves. For instance, the chapter on fractions describes the lesson and the classroom give-and-take as a group of fifth graders works out solutions, with reproductions of the students' written papers to show how individual children followed different methods to think out a solution. Though aimed at teachers, this book has an easy style that makes it accessible to parents as well.AAmy Brunvand, Univ. of Utah Lib., Salt Lake CityCopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "Review",
        "Math has gotten a bad reputation with the American public, and this book for parents and teachers provides possible reasons why this is so. The book also discusses what math can and should mean to people and explains how adults can avoid passing their math phobias on to their children.Author Marilyn Burns traces the underlying conflict between the public s assumption that mathematics means arithmetic and the belief of math educators that the mathematics taught in schools must foster reasoning, thinking, and problem-solving skills. The book begins by outlining the mathematics involved in preparing a holiday dinner: determining the size of the turkey, the amount of stuffing required, and the cooking time. Burns then compares this practical mathematics to what is taught in schools, explaining that there is a divide between the classroom emphasis on paper-and-pencil activities and the real-world application of mathematics. As an example, a chapter on pizza problems explores the meaning of doubling an object size, the relationship between diameter and area, and processes of mathematical thinking and investigation. Other topics discussed are the value of timed math tests, the use of expanded student answers in student-teacher communication, and the appropriate use of the calculator. The final chapters contain practical suggestions to help children avoid math phobias. Burns recommends actively engaging children in mathematics outside the classroom and supporting and encouraging children throughout their math education. An answer key contains the solution to the seven problems found in the book. Detailed explanations and illustrations of the reasoning behind the solutions are designed to help readers think mathematically. --Reviewed by Judy Spicer, Mathematics Abstractor.

        "About the Author",
        "Marilyn Burns is a nationally knows mathematics educator whose message about math have reached teachers thought her many books (including About Teaching Mathematics), videotapes, talks, and extensive program of Math Solutions courses. A former classroom teacher, she has written twelve books for children (including the best-selling The I Hate Mathematics! Book and the recently published The Greedy Triangle and Spaghetti and Meatballs for All!) and served as the math consultant for Disney's MathQuest with Aladdin, an interactive CD-ROM for young children. In 1996, Ms. Burns was the recipient of the Glenn Gilbert National Leadership Award, given by the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics. In 1997, she received the Louse Hay Award for Contributions to Mathematics Education from the Association for Women in Mathematics.",

For more than 50 years, Marilyn has taught children, led professional development sessions, spoken at conferences, contributed to professional journals, written more than a dozen books for children, and created more than 20 professional development resources for teachers and administrators. Marilyn continues to teach regularly in elementary classrooms, finding the experience essential to developing and testing new ideas and materials.', 'In 1984, Marilyn founded Math Solutions Professional Development, an organization dedicated to the improvement of math instruction in Grades K-8. Working with a highly qualified team of in-service leaders, Marilyn offered specialized courses to teachers and administrators nationwide.', 'Soon after, Marilyn began writing and publishing to further support teachers, and provide districts with the resources they needed to implement in-depth and long-lasting change in their schools. Her book, About Teaching Mathematics, has been widely used for pre-service and in-service teachers. Her series of resources include Math, Literature, and Nonfiction; Teaching Arithmetic; Lessons for Algebraic Thinking; and A Collection of Math Lessons.', 'In 1991, Marilyn was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from the Bank Street College of Education in New York.', 'In 1996, Marilyn received the Glenn Gilbert National Leadership Award from the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics for her influence on mathematics education. The nominators took special note of Marilyn’s humor and compassion, saying: “Few professionals have touched and inspired so many math educators. She has taught us several important lessons. . . . We must treat teachers with respect, honesty, and a thoughtful vision. We must turn to student work to make sense of student understanding and achievement.”', 'In 1997, Marilyn received the Louise Hay Award for Contributions to Mathematics Education from the Association for Women in Mathematics.', 'In collaboration with Scholastic in 2007, Marilyn developed Do The Math, a 13-module intervention program that focuses on Number and Operations. Do The Math targets addition and subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions. In 2011, Marilyn developed Do The Math Now!, extending Do The Math to serve students in grades 6 and up. In 2012, working with a team of Math Solutions colleagues, Marilyn developed a web-based formative assessment tool suitable for grades 5 and up, Math Reasoning Inventory (MRI), funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Also in 2012, Marilyn and Scholastic developed Math Reads, a program that helps teachers use children’s literature for teaching mathematics.', 'Marilyn continues to bring her messages directly to children and is the author of more than ten children’s books, including the best-selling The I Hate Mathematics! Book and The Book of Think. She launched Marilyn Burns Brainy Day Books for Scholastic with The Greedy Triangle; there are now five books in the series, including Spaghetti and Meatballs for All.', 'In 2010, Marilyn was inducted into the Educational Publishing Hall of Fame by the Association of Educational Publishers.']}"
