        "It can get cold even when you're hot on the trail of your quarry. Our Coburn Great Coat in 100% Wool is the go-to outer garment for dank, damp days and inclement evenings. It's no mystery that this great coat is the solution to your late 19th century style.The main layer of the coat features five black velvet-covered buttons leading up to a matching collar; velvet also appoints the front pockets. An additional pocket is found in the interior. Attached cowl hangs from the collar and drapes around the shoulders and torso to deflect rain.Made from 100% wool with a 100% cotton lining (torso and sleeves only). Imported. Dry clean only.Cowl reaches 21 inches down the back, while the bottom coat hem falls approximately 41 inches to stop just below the knee on the average height man.Sizing NotesThis overcoat is meant to be worn over a dress coat, and so it is made very generous through the chest and shoulders.Your chest measurement (in inches) is the size you should choose for proper overcoat sizing.If you do not intend to wear it over another dress coat, then you will likely need one size smaller than you normally wear. Please note, however, that the shoulders will still be oversized as they are designed to fit over the shoulder padding of the regular dress coat.See our storefront for more items!"
