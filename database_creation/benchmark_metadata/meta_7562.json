        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "There's justice, and then there's justice in Latt's third legal thriller (Powers of Attorney and Pursuit of Justice). While visiting her dying mother in L.A., deputy district attorney Alexandra Locke hears a death-bed confession from Erica Collins, a fellow hospital patient her mother has befriended. Erica tells Locke that 20 years ago her husband, Dr. George Collins, murdered his best friend, Jeffrey McGrath, and bribed a young DAALocke's father, Thomas KendallAto cover it up. Kendall is now an aggressive four-term district attorney in a stiff reelection race. If Locke doesn't investigate, Erica will send her evidence to the press. Reluctantly, Locke begins a probe and discovers that her father found McGrath's death \"accidental\" for lack of other evidence; McGrath's widow, Lorna, married George Collins; and the autopsy and ballistics reports are missing from the original Collins-McGrath case files. When Locke confronts her father privately, he orders her to drop the investigation. She doesn't, and inexorably, she's drawn into a web of McGrath and Collins family secrets. Then police find a stash of drugs in her apartment, and when Locke is arrested, she calls the one defense attorney in town she trusts, Patrick Ross, the college sweetheart she left years ago. Now she must prove she was framed, but if she does, she may bring down her own father. The dark family secrets Locke uncovers (including bribery, incest, rape, suicide and murder) are the foundation on which Latt constructs her competent plot, but one-dimensional characters, and the awkward, unnecessary repetition of facts that the reader already knows, diminish the appeal of a potentially promising thriller that seems, regrettably, to have been written by the numbers.

        "Chapter One",
        "Alexandra Locke rushed down the gray-carpeted corridor of the City of Hope Medical Center. It had already been a long day, and her body was weary with exhaustion. As a Los Angeles deputy district attorney, she'd spent most of the afternoon in court, questioning experts in an attempted murder case she was prosecuting. She'd then had to prepare a nervous witness for his next day's testimony. And once that was out of the way, she had to finish drafting a motion for another case that had to be filed the following morning. Everything was late.",
        "Upset about her delayed arrival at the hospital and anxious to see her mother, Alexandra was startled when a heavyset nurse stopped her in the hallway. \"I'm glad I caught you before you went in to visit your mother,\" the woman said.",
        "\"What is it? Has something happened?\" Alexandra asked, suddenly alarmed that her mother, who was undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, had taken a turn for the worse.",
        "\"No. No. She's the same.\" The nurse, whose badge identified her as B. Stevens, R.N., gave Alexandra a reassuring smile. \"In fact, she fell asleep a little while ago.\"",
        "Alexandra inhaled deeply, and impatiently waited for the nurse to explain why she'd stopped her.",
        "Ms. Stevens leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"I was kind of hoping you'd do me a small favor.\"",
        "\"What kind of favor?\"",
        "\"There's a patient by the name of Erica Collins and...well...she keeps insisting that she must speak to you,\" Ms. Stevens replied. \"Could you spare a few minutes?\"",
        "\"Me? Why?\"",
        "\"She didn't say, just that it was important.\"",
        "Looking at her watch, Alexandra hesitated. As it was, she had too little time to spend with her mother. But seeing the expectant look on the nurse's round face, and aware that Ms. Stevens had been really kind to her mother, Alexandra couldn't refuse. With a tired sigh, she gave in. \"What room is this Erica Collins in?\"",
        "Ms. Stevens pointed toward a room halfway down the hall.",
        "Noticing a sign on the door restricting the patient's visitors, Alexandra knocked softly before pushing it open.",
        "It was dark inside, the only bit of light coming from behind the partially closed door to the bathroom. The air in the room seemed stale and smelled heavily of antiseptic. Alexandra glanced over at the narrow hospital bed and saw a woman who appeared to be in her late sixties. It was hard to tell, though, because she had no hair and her body was hooked up to various tubes and bags.",
        "Clearing her throat, Alexandra said, \"Excuse me, I'm Alexandra Locke. Ms. Stevens said you wanted to see me?\"",
        "The woman's eyes flickered open, and with an apparent effort, she turned her pale face toward Alexandra. A slight smile touched her lips. \"So you're Alexandra.\" She motioned for her to come closer.",
        "When Erica spoke again, her voice was so faint that Alexandra had to bend down to hear it. \"I feel I already know you from the things your mother has said.\"",
        "That explained how this woman had come to ask for her, Alexandra thought. Although she didn't remember her mother ever mentioning an Erica Collins to her.",
        "\"You're very pretty,\" Erica muttered in the same faint voice. \"Except for the color of your hair, you look just like her.\"",
        "Alexandra absently pushed her dark blond hair away from her eyes. \"Thank you. How do you know my mother?\"",
        "\"We met here at the hospital. We both have the same kind of cancer.\" Erica's words were uttered slowly, as if speaking was burdensome for her. \"I've been doing my homework on you.\" She pointed to the metal cabinet next to her bed. \"Take out the envelope in the top drawer and you'll see what I mean.\"",
        "Intrigued, Alexandra pulled out a bulky manila envelope stuffed with papers, including numerous newspaper clippings.",
        "\"Go ahead and look,\" Erica urged.",
        "Gazing at the first of them, Alexandra was surprised to find that the article was about her and the last case she'd handled as an assistant district attorney in New York. It had been written after her successful prosecution of a dirty cop.",
        "Her brow furrowed, she glanced up at Erica. \"I'm afraid I don't understand. Where did you get this and why have you been reading up on my New York career?\"",
        "Erica's eyes narrowed slightly. \"Your mother mentioned she'd saved all of the stories on the cases you'd handled, so I asked to see them. I had to make sure you were the right one.\"",
        "\"'The right one' for what?\" Alexandra asked.",
        "\"To tell my story to,\" replied Erica. \"You see, there's something I have to tell, something that's been weighing on my mind for a very long time.\"",
        "Alexandra tensed; this conversation was going in a direction that made her uncomfortable. \"Why don't I get the chaplain?\"",
        "\"This is not about religion; it's about the law -- it's you I must talk to,\" the woman insisted. She struggled to sit up. \"You see,\" Erica said with difficulty, \"twenty years ago my husband, my ex-husband, George Collins, killed his best friend, Jeffrey McGrath. And I...I helped him get away with it.\"",
        "Startled by the nature of Erica Collins's admission, Alexandra stood silently for a moment considering her response. People sometimes confessed to crimes that they didn't commit, usually because they craved attention. That could be the case here. On the other hand, by admitting that she'd helped someone get away with murder, Erica Collins had opened herself up to a possible prison sentence. As a result, this type of declaration was given a certain amount of legal weight.",
        "To make a judgment call either way, Alexandra would need more facts. \"How did the two of you avoid prosecution?\"",
        "Erica licked her cracked lips, her gaze fixed on Alexandra. \"We gave a young deputy D.A. a lot of money -- one hundred thousand dollars in cash -- so George wouldn't go to prison.\"",
        "The thought of a district attorney taking a bribe sent a shudder through Alexandra.",
        "\"I think you might be interested in the rest of what I have to say,\" Erica said, her voice still soft but suddenly sturdier, less halting. \"The deputy D.A. in charge of the case was Thomas Kendell.\"",
        "Alexandra's head snapped back at the mention of her father's name. He'd been the District Attorney for Los Angeles County for twelve years. His record was spotless. Yet this woman was accusing her father of participating in a cover-up -- a charge that if proven would certainly end his career. Was there even the slightest possibility that she was speaking the truth?",
        "Alexandra tried to clear her head; she had to think over this accusation in a rational manner. \"Why are you telling me instead of going directly to the police?\" she asked, fixing her gaze on the woman.",
        "\"I wanted to tell someone I could trust. I want my ex-husband to spend the rest of his life in prison.\" She regarded Alexandra. \"Your mother said you'd prosecute",
        "anyone",
        "if you felt that person had violated the law.\" Erica pointed to one of the clippings. \"You're quoted here as saying",
        "'no one'",
        "is above the law. Is that true?\" Her voice had become hoarse and noticeably weaker.",
        "\"Yes, but...\"",
        "\"So then I've chosen wisely.\"",
        "Alexandra studied the woman for a moment. \"You didn't tell the authorities about this twenty years ago. Why now?\"",
        "A slight flush appeared on Erica's otherwise waxen face. \"I should have done it then, but...\" her voice faltered, \"I was afraid.\" She exhaled loudly. \"Now that I'm dying, it's different.\" She lay her head back against the pillows as if suddenly exhausted. \"George murdered a man in cold blood. I don't want to die with that crime on my conscience.\"",
        "Still dubious about the veracity of this woman's confession, and confused as to what she should do next, Alexandra frowned.",
        "Sensing Alexandra's hesitancy, Erica's tone became more urgent. \"I didn't understand then what I was getting into, and I didn't want to go to prison. But I'm dying now. I've g",
