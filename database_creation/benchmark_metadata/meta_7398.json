        "When Fabien Loche arrives in the Confederation as SolSystem's newest Liaison, his government believes he's a broken man sent into exile. But the new job, and the new culture, are far more strange and welcoming than either had anticipated. With the help of the local Chief Inspector, and his headstrong niece Molly, Loche plunges headlong into exploring and learning everything on the station above and world below.More is riding on his assimilation than his future. He's also the vanguard of the spaceborne Houses of SolSystem, who are preparing to flee the reach of an increasingly unstable and aggressive Earth. But the Confederation is far more fragmented and factioned than he expected. The scramble to control the highly advanced technology that the Houses will bring, and the fear of losing it, may be the wedge that drives Confederation and Sol System alike into war...",
        "\"Fabien Loche is a highly skilled operative with a mysterious past. Shunned and traumatized by the society of his home, he has crossed the galaxy to make a new life at Dundee Orbital over Inverness, a new planet. But what is he really doing there? What secrets lie locked up in his mind, inaccessible even to himself? The slow revelation of truth in Émigré is truly fascinating as we learn more and more about Fabien and his house. Mike Watson has begun something notable with this novel.” Kelly R., Red Adept",
        "“Thousands of years in the future, where other stars are reached and several new governments established, this story opens up into a looming civil war. Fabien Loche, spaceborn, has left the place he calls home from persecution, but what he finds on the planet Inverness is a challenge he never expected to face.” Taylor A. Red Adept"

Our school had a small library and I was allowed to check out books starting in the third grade. My mother was the school's Principal and she insisted that I read a book every two weeks. By the end of the year, I'd read everything in that small school library. My eighth birthday gift was a library card.\", \"I've always written fiction but didn't have an opportunity to devote time to it until just a few years ago. I had twenty years experience writing technical documents, but, I soon discovered that writing fiction is vastly different from writing nonfiction.\", '\"The Beacon at Barrington Light\" was my first indie release. All my previous sales had been through traditional channels.
