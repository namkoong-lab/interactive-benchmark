        "About the Author",
        "I'm Susan Wilkins, a television writer turned novelist, and I write crime thrillers that dig deep into human psychology.How do ordinary people end up on the wrong side of the law? That's what I'm always asking. The characters are central to all my stories. The protagonists tend to be female, but not always, and I specialise in female detectives.I grew up in Essex, studied Law, but spent twenty-five years writing television drama. I have over 130 broadcast credits to my name, including Casualty and Holby City, Heartbeat, Coronation Street and Eastenders, Footballers' Wives, Dangerfield and Down to Earth, and I created the pioneering BBC detective drama South of the Border. This was the best education anyone could have in how to craft a gripping, page turning story.I've just completed my tenth crime thriller. I've moved around a lot in my life, within the UK and abroad. But now I'm settled in Devon. I walk by the sea every day and drink too much coffee.If you'd like to find out more about my writing and keep in touch with my latest news, exclusive content and giveaways, visit susanwilkins.co.uk Follow me on Amazon to get news of new releases and special offers.You can also follow me on social media: facebook.com/susanwilkinsauthor twitter.com/susanwilkins32 instagram.com/susan_wilkins32",
