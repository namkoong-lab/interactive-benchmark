        "Essentials of Business Statistics: Communicating with Numbers",
        "is a core statistics textbook that sparks student interest and bridges the gap between how statistics is taught and how practitioners think about and apply statistical methods. Throughout the text, the emphasis is on communicating with numbers rather than on number crunching. By incorporating the perspective of professional users, the subject matter is more relevant and the presentation of material more straightforward for students.",
