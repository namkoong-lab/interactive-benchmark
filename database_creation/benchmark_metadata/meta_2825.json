        "The messages in this book were written over many years. These started soon after I attended a seminar in the mid-nineties on ‘Communion with God’ and ‘How to Hear His Voice’ by Dr. Mark Virkler.There was this desire in me to have a deeper walk with God and to know what His plan and purpose was for my life and to see the fulfilment of His healing promises to take place in the life of my daughter Amy.After the seminar, I started putting into practice what we had been suggested to do. During my quiet times with the Lord, I would sit with pen and paper ready to receive from Him, knowing that His Spirit was willing to convey to me what was on His heart. I heard no voice, but knew what to write as ‘whisper-like’ thoughts would come and at times, my pen would just flow with words of encouragement to strengthen my faith and reminding me that He is faithful to His word.On one occasion I felt He was saying; “You are wondering whether the words you are writing down are all from Me?’ ‘My child, with My presence in you, we are connected in spirit and in truth. You have been grounded in My word and My word is truth so when these words come out of your mouth or flowing onto the paper, whilst they are based on My word, it brings forth life as it will be like an echo of My word. Be encouraged, for the words that you speak are coming from your heart, for out of your mouth flows what has been instilled deep within!”While I was seeking the Lord to have my desires fulfilled, He showed me His heart and what He desires. He loves us and is vitally interested in every detail of our lives and He longs for us to seek Him and spend time in His presence, but also for our hearts to be linked up with His - to see the bigger picture - for there is the ‘great commission’ to be fulfilled of bringing in the harvest of many souls yet to be saved!Over time it occurred to me that even though these words were given mainly to me personally to help me walk out my purpose and destiny, they could also be shared with others, as we are all on a journey of faith, though our issues or trials might differ. It then made me consider having these published. This was confirmed to me recently in a most unexpected way, out of which the decision to go ahead was made.As you find yourself dipping into these pages, may you be inspired by the Holy Spirit to receive encouragement, hope and strength, so to continue your faith’s journey and fulfill your Kingdom destiny that He has purposed for you."
