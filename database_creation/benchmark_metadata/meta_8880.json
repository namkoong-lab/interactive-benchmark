        ". This children's Christmas picture book by Dahlov Ipcar is an unusual Christmas book. It is not about Santa Claus nor is it about the birth of Jesus. It does not feature lots of bright colors and frenetic activity. Instead, it is a quiet counting book, in rhyme, that features animals that live in the fields and forests of New England.”",

The accompanying text is a traditional children's counting poem, but Ipcars depiction of a wintery New England forest s inhabitants makes this a timeless classic. The cuddly black bears, prickly porcupines and squeaky chipmunks virtually flit through the pages in shades of sage green and deep orange. The illustrations are brightly imagined and will have you wanting to discover more of Ipcar's beautiful childrens books. This vibrant work of art will engage and delight both children and adults.\"",

        "About the Author",
        "Dahlov Ipcar was born in Vermont, raised in Greenwich Village, and summered in Maine after her parents (the famed sculptor William Zorach and artist Marguerite Zorach) bought a farm on Georgetown Island in 1923.Thirteen years later, eighteen-year-old Dahlov, an aspiring artist, married Adoph Ipcar. The young couple left New York City in 1937 to live on the Maine farm where they first met. By the early 1940s, she had nearly given up thoughts of writing and illustrating books, but was contacted by a New York publisher to illustrate The Little Fisherman, the latest title by Margaret Wise Brown. This charming title helped launch a four-decade run that saw her write and illustrate more than thirty children's books of her own. Today, her artwork is known worldwide, with pieces in the collections of numerous renowned museums. Meanwhile, she still lives and paints in the 1860s farmhouse that she shared with Adolph for nearly seventy years.",
