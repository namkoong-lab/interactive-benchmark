        "The cone shaped carbide drill bits are rounded at the top of the football shape barrel to help reach the problem areas that need to be smoothed out as quick as possible that is under the nail as well as closer to the cuticles and sidewalls. This carbide drill bit only fits 3/32\" shanks, however, small rounded side barrels size is perfect for detailed coverage and under the nails safely. The rounded head is safe to use on cuticles and nail walls. The cone shaped carbide drill bits come in 4 different sizes (ranging from extra fine to coarse) and 2 different colors (gold, and silver). Best for nail techs who are working on artificial nails, the drill bit has many uses: from smoothing, removing gel to cleaning hard to reach areas, such as under the nail."
