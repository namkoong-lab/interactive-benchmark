        "Diandra Casey and Gregory York are childhood rivals and longtime adversaries, both vying for the same powerful position at one of the country's most elite department stores. In order to determine who is best suited for the job, the two are confined together for a week in an elegant Boston town house, where they must catalog and store a priceless collection of antiques. But away from the pressures of corporate life, their feelings for each other suddenly seem less clear as attraction flares between them...surprising them with a sense of destiny that they are powerless to resist."
