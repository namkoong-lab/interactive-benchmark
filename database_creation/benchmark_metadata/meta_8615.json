I taught elementary school for a few years and then pursued a graduate degree at the University of MN. I graduated with a Ph.D. in 1979. I published my first book, EACH DAY A NEW BEGINNING: DAILY MEDITATIONS FOR WOMEN with Hazelden Publishing in 1982. It has been followed by the publication of 29 other books, the most recent of which is Each Day A Renewed Beginning: Meditations for a Peaceful Journey which was written during the quarantine. These meditations focus entirely on finding greater peace within the moments of each day. See www.womens-spirituality.com for a complete listing and description of each of my books. My focus as a writer is on the development of spiritual growth and strengthening one's twelve step recovery, and my personal experience is what I rely on, coupled with the wisdom I glean from the many people I walk among in the rooms of AA and Al-Anon. When I am not in front of the computer writing, I am likely giving a lecture or doing a workshop some where. I have spoken to tens of thousands world-wide over my 46 year tenure in recovery rooms. From each experience my gratitude grows. And from each experience, my commitment grows to continue doing what brings my life such joy.\"]}"
