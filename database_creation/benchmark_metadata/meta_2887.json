        "Kyle, a young newcomer to New Orleans, is haunted by the memory of his first lover, brutally murdered just outside the French Quarter. Marc, a young Quarter hustler, is haunted by an eccentric spirit that shares his dreams, and by the handsome but vicious lover who shares his bed.  When the barrier between these men comes down, it will prove thinner than the veil between the living and the dead…or between justice and revenge."
