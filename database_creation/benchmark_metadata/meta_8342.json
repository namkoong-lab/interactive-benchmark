        "Why another book about faith? We're glad you asked. Although much has been written and preached on the subject of faith, misunderstanding abounds when it comes to appropriating the blessings God has for his people. At one extreme are those sincere Christians who take a fatalistic approach, passively waiting to \"see what God will do\" on their behalf. At the other extreme are equally sincere believers who agressively \"name and claim\" the blessings they feel are rightfullt theirs.",
        "If you find yourself near either of these extremes, what youa re about to read will re-write your understanding of the faith life. If you are somewhere in between, you will find your faith enriched and strengthened."
