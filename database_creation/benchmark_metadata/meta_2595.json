        "In this gripping, war-torn epic novel, author Igor Štiks, a nominee for the IMPAC Dublin Award, tells the story of a celebrated writer who travels to Sarajevo to unearth devastating family secrets and the lies that have defined his life.",
        "Author Richard Richter’s mother and father were always phantoms, both parents having died by the time he was four. His life, now at a crossroads, has been a jumble of invention, elusive memories, and handed-down stories. But when Richard finds his mother’s hidden notebook, written by her during World War II, he discovers a confession that was never meant to be read by anyone—least of all, her son.",
        "Richard’s quest for the truth about his life leads him to an embattled Sarajevo. In the chaos of the besieged city, he discovers something more: a transformative romance and unexpected new friendships that will change the course of his search. But fate has been playing with all of them. And just as fate determines the lives of the characters in his novel, a betrayal reaching back half a century has yet to loosen its grip—on Richard, on everyone he has come to love, and on those he has no choice but to try to forgive."

        "“The idea that happiness and love are simply masking a truth that is revealed too late, after irreparable damage had been committed, is certainly a very psychoanalytic inspiration, but in the words of Igor Štiks, it is detailed in a poignant and terribly convincing text.”",

        "From the Publisher",
        "It isn’t often that I come across a contemporary novel that reads like a classic, but",
        "The Judgment of Richard Richter",
        "is one such book. Those of us who fell in love with books that left us thinking, from",
        "War and Peace",
        "to",
        "Ulysses",
        ", will find this a tale worth mining deeply. Richard Richter is a renowned international writer, who discovers secrets in his family history while going through what seems to be a midlife, post-divorce crisis. He leaves Paris for Vienna and then travels to Sarajevo, where war is breaking out. Richter delves into the city’s secrets and his own, finding both love and horror and discovering that, in a city of multitudes and paradoxes, nothing is as simple as he thought it would be. Author Igor Štiks deftly draws complex, believable characters who are not only at the mercy of history and the Yugoslav wars taking place around them, but often act against their own self-interest, at times seeming to be compelled by fate and destiny or trying to absolve themselves of personal responsibility.

        "Oedipus Rex",
        ". But this book is not merely an intellectual delight—it’s an emotional one as well, ultimately leaving us with a reminder of our shared humanity, even in the most dire of circumstances.",
