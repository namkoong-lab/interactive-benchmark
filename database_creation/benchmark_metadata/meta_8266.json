        "We're on the cusp of new era in the great adventure of space exploration.",
        "More than a half-century ago, humanity first hurled objects into space, and almost 50 years ago, astronauts first walked on the moon. Since then, we have explored Earth's orbit with shuttles, capsules, and space stations; sent robots to Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus; sampled a comet; sent telescopes into orbit; and charted most of our own planet.In",
        "Space 2.0",
        ", space historian Rod Pyle, in collaboration with the National Space Society, will give you an inside look at the next few decades of spaceflight and long-term plans for exploration, utilization, and settlement.No longer the exclusive domain of government entities such as NASA and other national agencies, space exploration is rapidly becoming privatized, with entrepreneurial startups building huge rocket boosters, satellites, rocket engines, asteroid probes, prospecting craft, and even commercial lunar cargo landers to open this new frontier. Research into ever more sophisticated propulsion and life support systems will soon enable the journey to Mars and destinations deeper in our solar system. As these technologies continue to move forward, there are virtually no limits to human spaceflight and robotic exploration.While the world has waited since the Apollo lunar program for the next \"giant leap,\" these critical innovations, most of which are within our grasp with today's technology, will change the way we live, both in space and on Earth. A new space age--and with it, a new age of peace and prosperity on Earth, and settlement beyond our planet--can be ours.Speaking with key leaders of the latest space programs and innovations, Pyle shares the excitement and promise of this new era of exploration and economic development. From NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, to emerging leaders in the private sector such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, Moon Express, Virgin Galactic, and many others,",

My goal as an author is to bring you readable, compelling, engaging, and entertaining narratives of space exploration, technology, and the amazing people that make it happen.', 'Few of us have a chance to do what we really love and get paid for it. After years of working in many industries, including television, new media, academia and others, I have been blessed with the rare opportunity to write books. I hope you enjoy them.', 'Like many of my generation, I was enthralled by the flights of Mercury, Gemini, and especially Apollo. As those ghostly images came down from the moon, improving on each flight, I stayed home from high school to savor every moment the networks were willing to show us (at the expense of the daytime soaps, which eventually won the airtime battle). Viking landings and journey of the Pioneers and Voyagers to the outer planets followed shortly thereafter. Writing narrative space history books, as well as space journalism for NASA/JPL, Caltech, Space.com and many other outlets, has been my passion for over a decade.', 'New books for 2016/2017 include \"Mars: Making Contact\", a lavishly illustrated history of the exploration of the red planet (Carlton Books), \"Blueprint for a Battlestar\", containing explanations and examples of technologies commonly found in science-fiction (Sterling Books) , and \"Amazing Stories of the Space Age\", featuring twenty of my favorite tales from the golden age of space exploration (Prometheus Books).', 'This is a thrilling time for space exploration and I hope to share this excitement with many more readers. You can follow current books and projects at www.pylebooks.com. I look forward to hearing from you.']}"
