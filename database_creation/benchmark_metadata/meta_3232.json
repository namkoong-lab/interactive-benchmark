        "BETTER THAN NOODLES Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our wis a PLANT BASED healthy, alternative to traditional pasta. Made from purified water and Juroat (Organic Konjac flour and Organic Oat Fiber - a water soluble fiber), it naturally slows the digestion process, making you feel fuller for a longer period of time. Pre-cooked, with a 24-mo. shelf life and no refrigeration needed until opening, our \"noodles\" are a healthy, quick addition to any meal. HOW BETTER THAN BEGAN In 2013, my husband and I, both pharmacists, developed a specialized recipe from the root of Organic Konjac plants, Purified water and Organic Oat Fiber. One day, I decided to try and make a pizza crust using Glucomannan. The outcome was a horrible gel-like mass, instead of pizza. After further research, I discovered that Glucomannan comes from a plant called Konjac, which is used to make Konjac flour. The Japanese have been using this flour to make healthier noodles for centuries. So, in October 2010, I researched manufacturers, tried lots of samples and I hated what I tasted at first. However, by 2013 we had developed a completely new recipe called Juroat (Konjac flour and Oat fiber), which gives the noodles a better bite, a better texture and the look of real pasta and noodles.\" We hope you enjoy!
