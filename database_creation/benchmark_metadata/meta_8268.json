He moved to Washington, DC for college. Just before graduation, Kevin met his husband, Tim, who serves in the U.S. Navy. Together they always wanted a family and adoption was their chosen path. They started their adoption journey in early 2011, and brought home their daughter in spring 2013.', 'Kevin is a strong supporter of open adoption. In researching this book, Kevin realized the lack of LGBT friendly, open-adoption stories, especially ones that showed the tough decision the birth family makes and the positive relationship that can emerge. Kevin hopes this book and future books will fill this gap and help show the benefits of open adoption.']}"
