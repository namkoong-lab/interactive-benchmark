        "It is so soothing to be in Emily Pollifax's presence: we know that, at any time, she may leave her tidy existence in Connecticut (complete with geraniums and an understanding husband) and venture forth, with manners and nerves of steel, to do whatever the CIA has planned for her. This time, with her rakish cohort Farrell, she's sent to Syria. An American girl named Amanda Pym has faced down a handful of skyjacking terrorists and then vanished. Mrs. P and Farrell track Amanda down with the barest of clues, through souks and tourist destinations, through the desert and an archaeological dig where an earnest young professor named Joe manages to assist with borrowed vehicles, large numbers of sheep, and other tools. It's wonderful to watch Mrs. Pollifax manage it all with clear thinking and the midlife woman's ability to fade into the scenery as someone's aunt or mum. Along the way, there's lots of local color, a bit of politics, useful phrases in Arabic, and some really elegant use of ancient Babylonian verse.",

        "Mrs. Pollifax Unveiled ($23.00; Feb.; 208 pp.; 0-345-43652-0) Gilman returns from the fairy-tale purlieus of Thale's Folly (p. 107) to the more-well-trodden paths of Emily Pollifax, whose status as unlikely secret agent is being seriously undermined by her durability (this 14th title ties her with Ian Fleming's James Bond). This time, Mrs. Pollifax is searching for Amanda Pym, who foiled an airline hijacking only to vanish among a sea of popping press flashbulbs after her plane touched down in Damascus. --",

        "Mrs. Pollifax was feeling boredand rather left out of life. Cyrus had re-centlyaccepted an invitation to teachlaw three days a week at the university; he washugely enjoying it.\"Damned good to feel so useful again,\" he'dadmitted, and she was glad for him.She, however, was not feeling particularlyuseful. She reminded herself that she was stillgrowing prizewinning geraniums, was in excel-lenthealth, hoped soon to earn her black belt inkarate, and remained a faithful member of theSave Our Environment club. But . . . How spoiledI am, she thought. For a woman of what was delicatelyreferred to as \"of a certain age\" she oughtto feel fortunate indeed, and yet . . . She realizedthat she was absentmindedly scratching her leftarm from which, not long ago, a bullet had beenremoved in a Bedouin tent by a man namedBushaq, and she concluded that what she was experiencingwas letdown.The price one pays, she thought sadly, for venturingout into dangerous worlds for Carstairsand the CIA, only to return to errands at the grocerystore and bank, cooking and cleaning, mulch-ingher garden for the winter, and pampering hergeraniums.Across the breakfast table from her, almosthidden behind his newspaper, Cyrus glanced upand saw the gesture toward her arm. \"Stillhurting?\" he asked. \"Do wish you'd let Dr. Ortonhave a look at that.\" He hesitated, and then,\"Damn good to have you safe at home again,Em,\" and as he said this the telephone rang. Heput down his cup of coffee, reached across hisbriefcase and newspaper, and when he answeredit she saw his face change. Handing the phone toher he said, \"It's Bishop.\"\"Oh,\" she said, startled, and concealing herreaction she kept her voice casual. \"Bishop, howgood to hear from you, are you well?\"Bishop, however, was not interested in politeconversation. He said bluntly, \"Have any importantplans for this day?\"\"No,\" she said, honestly enough.\"A car will pick you up in forty minutes atyour house,\" he said. \"Carstairs wants to talkwith you. Oh, and you might bring your pass-portwith you, just in case.\"And he hung up.\"Emily,\" said her husband warningly.\"He just wants to talk with me,\" she told him.\"Hard to believe,\" growled Cyrus. \"Youhaven't even been home long enough for thatarm to heal.\"\"It's healed,\" she told him. \"It just itches.\"He gave her a rueful smile. \"I know, I know--Ipromised never to interfere, but still I don't likethe sound of that call.\" With a glance at the clockon the wall he added, \"And now I've got to go orI'll miss my first class, but Em--nothing dangerous,promise?\"He knew, of course, that anything Carstairsmight have in mind could be dangerous; after all,she and Cyrus had met in Zambia under verydangerous circumstances and they had survivedby luck and ingenuity. Cyrus had gone with herto Thailand, too, where he'd been snatched awayfrom her by bandits, but she did not think it wiseto remind him of this, nor to mention that Bishophad asked her to bring her passport. Instead shesaid tactfully, with a bright smile, \"Barbecuedchicken for dinner tonight,\" and when he hadgone she hurried upstairs to dress for her trip toCIA headquarters.",
