    "description": [
        "The Four Leaf Clover, also known as the Clover Fern, originates from inland Australia. It has two pairs of leaflets arranged in a four leaf clover pattern. The Four Leaf Clover can grow in a number of different soil types, ranging from sands to clays. Under the proper conditions, this fern will form a thick carpet with its numerous runners. It is amphibious, and will grow either partially or fully submersed. The Four Leaf Clover requires high light conditions and water temperatures between 68°-84°F for best growth. It prefers water that has a neutral pH, but can be housed in water with a pH of 6.2-7.5 and still flourish. A nutrient rich substrate will promote growth. Planting the runners that grow from mature, healthy plants is the best way to propagate the Four Leaf Clover. When the \"baby\" is approximately half the size of the \"parent,\" cut the roots apart so they may grow separate from one another. They may occasionally produce seeds that can be used to cultivate new plants, and can also produce adventitious shoots to be used for propagation."
