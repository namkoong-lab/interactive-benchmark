        "Original Perry Work Suspender. This unique suspender is intended to be worn with a belt. Eliminates the u201cSagging Pant Syndromeu201d. This heavy-duty suspender is made of a quality elastic material and is 2\" wide with a top grain cowhide back piece. What makes this item unique are the plastic clips that go on your belt. Men who wear these suspenders love them! When they bend over their pants go with them. Available in Black, Navy, Red, and Tan. Comes in two lengths: Regular and Tall. If you are unsure which size to order, follow these instructions to assist you. Take a tape measure and measure from the bottom of your belt up over your shoulder to the bottom of your belt to see how many inches you need. If your measurement is less than 48\" then the Regular size is right for you. If your measurement is more than 48\", then you will need to order the Tall."
