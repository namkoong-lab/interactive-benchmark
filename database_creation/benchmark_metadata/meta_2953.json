        "Review",
        "\"Nadine Artemis's well-balanced, well-researched book credibly encourages readers to take control of their own dental health. Plenty to chew on in this stimulating dental compendium.\" —Kirkus Reviews“Achieving optimal oral health cannot be done exclusively in the dental office; oral hygiene and nutrition are key to preventing major dental work and the consequences it can have on the body. I have helped people at a professional level for thirty years and it is clear that we must give people tools to help themselves at home, for their everyday care. This book helps the dental profession and makes dental care more accessible.” —Lina Garcia, DDS, DMD   “Nadine Artemis brings great clarity and insight to the mouth-body connection.",

        "Every once in a while, a book comes along that's fun to read and can make a difference. This is such a book. As a holistic dentist practicing for over twenty-five years, I thought I had read or seen just about everything written about dentistry. I was very pleased when Nadine asked me to write a forward for her book. Knowing her products, I felt that this could be a good thing. Being somewhat tired of reading books about teeth, I put this off for a few weeks. Finally on a rainy day I picked it up. What a surprise! I found myself transported into a tour of the mouth in a way that hasn't happened in a long time. ... It was great. I felt like I was on a small boat sailing through the oral cavity for the tour of my life. The writing and the accuracy of her work will make you appreciate your mouth all the more. The discussion of the meridians involving teeth is important material that most books don't mention, yet it is significant because knowing this can help you with many problems in the rest of your system. For instance, if you go to the dentist with a pain in your lower first molar, your dentist could tell you that there is nothing wrong with the tooth. You'll find out that this is a digestive problem, and once it is corrected, the tooth pain will be gone. You'll learn about the mouth as an ecosystem that is part of the larger system of the body.Nadine's knowledge of healing methods is truly inspiring. There are many natural ways to keep your mouth healthy that also spill over into general good health. The techniques and materials that Nadine talks about are the best for making sure your mouth stays healthy. Her comments regarding regeneration are some of the best I've seen. There is one problem with this book: by following Nadine's advice, I won't get the chance to do lots of restorative therapy for your mouth, since you won't need it.Yours in healthVictor Zeines, DDS, MS, FAGD",
