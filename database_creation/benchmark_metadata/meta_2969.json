        "Golden Days…",
        "Famous for her agricultural innovations, Amy, Lady Mowbray has never had a romantical thought in her life. Well, apart from her short-lived crush on London’s handsomest man, Lord Pascal, when she was a brainless 14-year-old. She even chose her late husband because he owned the best herd of beef cattle in England! But fate steps in and waltzes this practical widow out of her rustic retreat into the glamour of the London season. When Pascal pursues her, all her adolescent fantasies come true. And those fantasies turn disturbingly adult when grown-up desire enters the equation. Amy plunges headlong into a reckless affair that promises pleasure beyond her wildest dreams – until she discovers that this glittering world hides damaging secrets and painful revelations set to break a country girl’s tender heart.",
        "All that glitters…",
        "Gervaise Dacre, Lord Pascal needs to marry money to rescue his estate, devastated after a violent storm. He’s never much liked his reputation as London’s handsomest man, but it certainly comes in handy when the time arrives to seek a rich bride. Unfortunately, the current crop of debutantes bores him silly, and he finds himself praying for a sensible woman with a generous dowry. When he meets Dashing Widow Amy Mowbray, it seems all his prayers have been answered. But his mercenary quest becomes dangerously complicated when he finds himself in thrall to the lovely widow. Soon he’s much more interested in passion than in pounds, shillings and pence. What happens if Amy discovers the sordid truth behind his whirlwind courtship? And if she does, will she see beyond his original, selfish motives to the ardent love that lies unspoken in his sinful heart?"

        "\"Another charming novella to add to this delightfully entertaining series.\" 5* Rakes and Rascals\"Amazing!\" Top Pick. Night Owl Romance\"I absolutely adored this book. It's well written, endearing, and full of delicious Regency details. Most especially, the romance between Amy and Gervaise is just lovely. Their attraction to one another crackles, and the scenes in which they finally realize those feelings are worth the wait. This is wonderfully balanced by their growing affections for one another; as the sexual tension between them builds, so too does the trust and intimacy, such that each is able to reveal doubts and insecurities they thought they'd never share with another person. By the end of the book I felt like I was watching two beloved friends finding true love in one another...and who doesn't want that?!\" Anonymisses\"I found this installment in Anna Campbell's Dashing Widows series a thoroughly enjoyable read. The characters had depth and the storyline was thought provoking and sensual. This author never disappoints.\" 5* Kathleen A. Tolliver, Amazon Review\"My favorite book of the series so far.\" 5* Tracy Emro, Amazon Review\"Anna Campbell provides us with a short, sweet and steamy historical romance that packs a punch.\" Stacey is Sassy\"Five stars aren't enough!\" 5* Becky, Amazon Review\"A delightful story with wonderful dialogue.\" 5* Blue Mood Café\"A delightful Regency story! Skillfully written by Anna Campbell, Pursuing Lord Dashing, is the charming story of lovable Amy and Pascal, characters that you won't be able to resist loving! Readers, who love Regency romance, will be pleased!\" 5* Nicole Laverdure Reviews\"Anna Campbell's trademark charm, entertainment, and steam.\" Roses Are Blue\"What a wonderful couple and another fantastic story to add to this series!\" 5* Rose Is Reading\"A wonderful book that made me go all gooey multiple times!\" 5* Siobhan Johnson, GoodReads Review\"The fourth book in a must read that's fun, decadent, flirty and daring story of a woman who will discover that sometimes the unexpected gifts are those that appear to be the most challenging. A spicy read that's perfect for a quick bookcation.\" 5* Books I Love a Latte\"Wit and poignancy blend elegantly in all Anna Campbell's portrayals and make reading one of her books a one of a kind experience. Without hesitation Pursuing Lord Pascal is a worthy use of ones time!\" 5* Jennifer, GoodReads Review",
