        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Though it may in part revere the tall, essayist Cohen proclaims, clearly \"society is not built for us.\" Six-foot-three Cohen (Confessions of a High School Word Nerd) covers many taken-for-granted challenges facing \"talls,\" including public toilets, exercise bikes, doorways, couches and airplanes. Especially complicated is dating; some tall women would never \"date down\"-that is, a man shorter than they are-while other talls (i.e. men) refuse to date anyone but the short. Being tall costs more, due to expenses like \"double-price clothes,\" \"high ceilinged homes,\" and \"the food,\" but it also pays better: tall people earn approximately 2.5% more per inch. Height also helps get presidents elected; 26 out of the last 30 presidential contests went to the taller candidate. Cohen has been frustrated, ever since she was a 5'3\" eight-year-old that no one has written a book about tall people (\"The Dewey Decimal index didn't even assign a classification number to tall people. Surely the world kidded\"). She fixes that problem handily with a guide both practical and proud, and with enough self-deprecating humor to charm readers of any height; an ideal gift for talls, their loved ones, and (perhaps) their jealous detractors.

        "Review",
        "“Given her smarts, inquisitiveness, and warm wit, I'd follow Ms. Cohen up any learning curve. With",
        "The Tall Book",
        "her assignment is personal, and richer for it. The result is a real resource for giants of all ages (and those who love them) so that we can fully appreciate the advantages and navigate the downfalls of our standing. Not since Randy Newman's \"Short People\" have those of us of a certain stature had a better rallying cry.” ―",
        "Brad Wieners, 6'7\", Editor, Men's Journal",
        "“This is a funny and lively book that belongs -- quite literally -- on the top shelf of American literature. One of us 'talls' will be happy to get it down for you.” ―",

        "“As a 12-year-old, told to act my age and not my shoe size, I could honestly say, 'They're the same.' Arianne Cohen has written a book for everyone, like me, who grew up (and up) to be proud of their height.” ―",
