        "The macabre but beautiful work,",
        "Les Chants de Maldoror",
        ", has achieved a considerable reputation as one of the earliest and most extraordinary examples of Surrealist writing. It is a long narrative prose poem which celebrates the principle of Evil in an elaborate style and with a passion akin to religious fanaticism. The French poet-critic Georges Hugnet has written of Lautréamont: \"He terrifies, stupefies, strikes dumb. He could look squarely at that which others had merely given a passing glance.\"",

Later still, Lautréamont was to be canonized as one of their principal \"ancestors\" by the Paris Surrealists.",
        "This edition, translated by Guy Wernham, includes also a long introduction to a never-written, or now lost, volume of poetry. Thus, except for a few letters, it gives all the surviving literary work of Lautréamont."
