    "description": [
        "Designed to comfortably position the foot in a controlled amount of dorsi flexion to provide a gentle stretch to the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. This gentle stretch helps reduce the muscle contracture, inflammation and associated pain. The lightweight, low profile shell is sturdy and breathable and has three padded straps with buckles to ensure immobilization. The soft foam interior is brethable to eliminate heat buildup and the adjustable dorsi flexion straps provide a gentle stretching of the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. The purpose of night splinting is to keep the patient's ankle in a neutral position overnight, passively stretching the calf and plantar fascia during sleep. The intent is to allow the fascia to heal. Clinical study of night splinting has yielded mixed reviews. Some reports claim improvement in approximately 80 percent of patients. (11) In contrast, one study of 116 patients showed no benefit after three months compared to no treatment.
