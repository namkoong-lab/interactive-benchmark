        "One bag of dehydrated coconut and one bag of dehydrated pineapple. A combination of naturally sweet and healthy treats rich in vitamins and nutrients. We buy our treats in bulk from a major supplier of the \"people food\" chains. Why not give our little buddies stuff good enough for the whole family to share? (furry and two legged) These diced chunks are smaller than you will find in most retail outlets and are easy for sugar gliders to handle. How about a coconut in one paw and a pineapple in the other. Sounds a bit like a pina colada to me. Yummy."
