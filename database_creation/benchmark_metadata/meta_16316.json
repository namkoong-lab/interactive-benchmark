        "Press: Question for Mr. Ball and Mr. Mitt. By the way, helluva game fellas. Congratulations.",
        "Both Ball & Mitt: Thank you.",
        "Press: I understand you both were on the opposite side of Casey there at the end, tell us how it felt to send Casey packing on a third strike.",
        "Ball: I'll take this one. What an exciting feeling. After Flynn and Blake made it on base, I could feel the sweat dripping from the pitcher's hand. Then two quick strikes. I had chills on that last one.",
        "*speedy chattering sounds of a dozen typewriters*",
        "Press: Fascinating. What an upset! Now for you Mr. Mitt.",
        "Mr. Glove: It's actually Mr. Glove, Mitt was my father.",
        "Press: My apologies, Mr. Glove. How'd it feel to catch that last strike tonight?",
        "Mr. Glove: Unreal. What a huge game for our guys. I've been attached to my catcher for years now. It was a true career-defining moment.",
        "Press: It most certainly was. Any truth to Mudville's allegations of the ump throwing the game? After all, it is 1888 and we don't have our sh** together just yet.",
        "Mr. Ball: None. Absolutely zero concern of foul play. Where'd you hear that? I don't even think the mighty Casey would argue that.",
