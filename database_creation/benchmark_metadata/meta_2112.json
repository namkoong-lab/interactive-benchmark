        "No more chocolate! No more meddling! No more men!",
        "New Year's resolutions are great. Announcing them in a crowded bar, with a chocolate martini in her hand? Not Maddie Cash's finest moment. It's time this new realtor got serious about her life and this time, she means it.But when hospital volunteering lands her at the bedside of bruised and battered Mick Meyer, who has no knowledge of Maddie's reputation - and no memory of the kiss he begged from her during that long, pain-filled night, her best-laid plans are put in jeopardy. It's not just his sweet tooth that's tempting her.The hunky bush pilot with the concussion has an old family property to unload. Making this sale could rejuvenate Maddie's dying career. But when Mick turns on the charm, she's in danger of forgetting all her best intentions... on chocolate... on meddling... and especially on men.",

        "Did you know that THE CHOCOLATE CURE is also part of my Montana Home series? It picks up where CINDERELLA'S COWBOY leaves off, following the life of Maddie Cash, stepsister to Cynthia \"Cinderella\" Henley. Other beloved characters have cameo appearances as well, and even more follow in DeeDee Cash's story, THE CHOCOLATE COMEBACK.Readers loved Cynthia and Chad in CINDERELLA'S COWBOY and they loved to \"hate\" Cyn's blissfully self-centered twin stepsisters. Now you can find out why Maddie and DeeDee are the way they were... and how giving up everything they thought they wanted helped them become more than they ever dreamed they could be.And maybe find love along the way, too.",

Praised for her strong heroines and true-to-life heroes, her award-winning stories always contain complications arising from modern family dynamics. As a former veterinary technician, mother of three grown daughters and wife of mumble-mumble years, animals, kids and husbands are her forte. Emotional conflict, tears, angst... those wretched \"growth-opportunity\" moments your friends comfort you about... that\\'s what she writes, and readers love it.', \"Earlier in her career, thanks to her veterinary experience, Roxanne wrote a series of non-fiction books about the human-animal bond, as Roxanne Willems Snopek. During that time, she spoke with many fascinating people, and learned much about service animals, particularly dogs for children with autism. She loves including bits about this in her fiction. So far, she's written two books with autism service dogs (Three River Ranch and Finding Home) and one with therapeutic horseback riding (His Reluctant Rancher), all of which were born out of her earlier research. She's also got feral cat colonies, wild mustangs, match-making dogs and lots of other animals.\", \"In her spare time, Roxanne loves to wrangle her suburban wilderness garden, which she shares with deer, coyotes, bear, bobcat and even a cougar, though thankfully she hasn't seen that one. She dabbles in many things, including painting (she uses leftover indoor house paint), piano (still plans to take that Grade 8 exam... one day), yoga (once completed a 100-Day Bikram Yoga challenge), cooking (I can hear you laughing from here, honey) but her favorite thing is, of course, reading. Her list of favorite authors is long and ever-changing, but includes Robyn Carr, Barbara O'Neal, Wendy Corsi Staub, Lois Greiman, Barbara Kingsolver, Sandra Brown, Leah McLaren, Sheila Roberts, Lianne Moriarty... and on and on... you get the picture.\", \"She loves to connect with other book-lovers, so she'd be thrilled if you dropped by her various social media pages. And be sure to click FOLLOW on this page, too, to receive updates about her new releases.\", 'Visit her blog at: www.roxannesnopek.ca (Be sure to sign up for her newsletter)', \"Follow her Facebook at www.Facebook.com/RoxanneSnopekAuthor (you can sign up here, too, if that's more convenient)\", 'And of course, you can follow her on Twitter as well @RoxanneSnopek', 'Thanks for stopping by!']}"
