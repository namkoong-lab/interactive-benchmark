        "No one would ever expect what haunted him because he hid it so well....",
        "As a former Navy SEAL sniper, Brick has faced his share of intense situations, but nothing could have prepared him for his latest assignment. The king of hookups, going undercover with a ring on his left finger may as well be a noose around his neck. If that’s not enough, he’s paired with a whirlwind of a woman who’s as outspoken as she is curvy.",
        "Fresh off the heels of a life-changing breakup, Londyn crashes at her sister’s house. To prevent knocking heads with her future brother-in-law, Mercy, she jumps at the opportunity to take the undercover job that has her “playing house” with the notorious playboy of the Shadows crew. His laid-back personality, coupled with stunning good looks, should make this a walk in the park. If they weren’t trying to catch a murderer.",
        "Brick, however, is unprepared for the intimacy that comes with living as a married couple and soon the lines between real life and assignment begin to blur. But beneath his easygoing smile there’s a secret he hides from the world. One he’s not sure he’s willing to let it come to light.",
        "Note: Brick is the sixth book of the Guts & Glory series, a six-book spin-off from my Dirty Angels MC series. While it’s recommended to read both series in order, each book can be read as a stand-alone. As with all my books, this has an HEA, no cliffhanger or cheating."
