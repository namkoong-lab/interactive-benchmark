        "\"The characters are well drawn and dynamic and I think any child would delight over the colorful images displayed on each page.\"",
        "- One Frugal Girl",
        "\"This children's read is the perfect read to help instill confidence in a child who finds themselves worrying about trying new things or simply getting them to believe in themselves.\"",
        "- Cherry Blossoms",
        "\"The message is perfect for both children & adults alike: rather than fretting, go and live your life, try new things and see what happens. You may discover something new!\"",
        "- Walking With Nora",
        "\"The illustrations completely MAKE this book.  It's bold, fun, and adorable.  Although it's available for Kindle, I highly suggest the print copy. It's a large and attractive book that makes a great gift. Your little one will get a kick out of Tiny and how he handles his fears.\"",

        "From the Author",
        "The story's message is like the Mark Twain quote, \"I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.\" We all get apprehensive when encountering new experiences and this often leads us to avoid ever trying anything new. Just having a little courage to try new things can often lead to a much more exciting and enriching life.",
