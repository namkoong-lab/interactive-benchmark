    "description": [
        "Destin, Florida like you’ve never seen it before. This beautiful, reverse-painted glass ornament shows the beach scene in full 360 degrees. It continues an ancient art-form prized by collectors. The artists choosing from a selection of miniature curved and bent-shafted brushes, painstakingly hand paints every minute detail on the inside of the ornament. The craft requires the artists to repeatedly insert the brush through the small opening in the sphere; first to outline the design, and then to detail the colors one by one. The entire process for each ornament requires up to two days. No two pieces are identical, making this inside-painted glass ornament a keepsake to be treasured from generation to generation."
