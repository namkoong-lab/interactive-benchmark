    "description": [
        "The Olympus FL-LM1 Flash is a compact (1.5 x 1.3 x 1.7\") and lightweight (0.88 oz) dedicated flash for Olympus E-PM1 and E-PL3 Micro 4/3 cameras. The FL-LM1 has a guide number of 23' / 10m at ISO 200 and provides coverage wide enough for a 14 mm lens. TTL operation is enabled, as well as wireless TTL operation when used with the FL-50R, FL-36R or FL-300R flashes. Best of all, this little beauty does not require batteries of any kind - it's powered by a flash-charging circuit that's built into the camera body."
