        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 3–6—Astonishing full-color illustrations accompany accessible text that elaborates on the marvels to be found in Earth's oceans. The content is divided into sections that cover aquatic subjects from shallow rock pools to the deepest depths, in addition to sea forests and coral reefs. Most of the organisms described will be unfamiliar to readers, such as diatoms, bryozoan, and foraminifera, as well as more well-known life-forms, such as octopuses, sea horses, and kelp. Microscopic close-ups exhibit the beauty and wonder of these creatures in great detail. Each subject is identified by its Latin and common name, size, and location. Also noted are unusual behaviors, habits, and habitats as well as role in the ecosystem. The magnificent diversity of the seas, the variety of patterns and shapes, and the utter beauty of these amazing creatures are well served by Taylor's artwork and will invite readers to further explore marine life. An adequate bibliography and suggested websites for further information are helpful for curious students. VERDICT Stunning close-up illustrations make this a valuable addition to any science or animal collection.—Eva Elisabeth VonAncken, formerly at Trinity-Pawling School, NY",
        "Review",
        "The introduction accurately states that \"this book shines a light on a few of the extraordinary creatures that live beneath the waves.\"... Readers will recognize a few of the highlighted creatures, but it is refreshing to find so many less-than-popular organisms getting some attention...Art, text, and layout create a pleasing combination for a science shelf or a coffee table.—Kirkus ReviewsBaker and Taylor take readers from the ocean’s shallows to its deepest depths as they highlight singular or little-known aquatic creatures...A dazzlingly illustrated look at creatures unusual and often unseen.—Publishers WeeklyAstonishing full-color illustrations accompany accessible text that elaborates on the marvels to be found in Earth’s oceans...Stunning close-up illustrations make this a valuable addition to any science or animal collection.—School Library JournalThe size of the volume and large illustrations could allow this title to be a nice coffee table book. The illustrations are beautiful and make it clear to young readers that the volume provides facts, not fiction.—School Library Connection OnlineThis enchantingly illustrated picture book for middle-grade readers introduces some fascinating sea life and a variety of their habitats...Descriptive, vivid prose nicely counterbalances the scientific information, while the luminous mixed-media renderings, ranging from striking full-color spreads to enlarged images of microscopic organisms, emphasize the beauty and wonder of sea life.—Booklist Online",
