        "Kristan “Stan” Connor gladly turned tail on her high-flying job and moved to a quaint New England town to sell organic pet treats. But with her nose for solving murders, there’s no such thing as a quiet life…",
        "Summer is winding down in Frog Ledge, Connecticut, but Stan’s love life and career are both heating up nicely. In between planning her new pet patisserie and café, Stan is settling into living-in-bliss with sexy pub owner Jake McGee. Love’s on the menu for Stan’s mom, Patricia, too, who’s engaged to Frog Ledge’s mayor, Tony Falco. Mayor Falco’s dogged ambition isn’t popular among locals, but it’s his executive coach, Eleanor Chang, who’s inspired a dangerous grudge. When Eleanor is found dead, there’s a whole pack of suspects to choose from. Stan has first-hand experience of Eleanor’s unsavory business tactics. But finding out who forced her to take a fatal plunge off the corporate ladder means unearthing some shady secrets…and a killer who’s too close for comfort.",

Before that, she would tell them to anyone who would listen (not many at the time). After deciding early on she would write books for a living, she practiced by writing bad, angst-filled poems, short stories and even a storyline for a soap opera--all by age 15. She never wavered from her goals despite all the usual questions including, \"So are you going to be an English teacher with that degree in English?\" or, \"That writing thing sounds nice, but how are you REALLY going to make a living?\"', \"She went on to get a master's in writing and publishing and spent time in journalism, PR, communications and presently, marketing. And she's confident this writing thing IS the way to make a living.\", \"Aside from writing, she loves animals (has a houseful), the beach, reading other writers' masterpieces and Starbucks coffee.\"]}"
