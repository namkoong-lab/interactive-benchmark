        "About Pearl Izumi",
        "More than 50 years ago in Tokyo, a father produced Japan's first bicycle racing apparel for his son, a promising racer. He named his soon-to-be-established company Pearl Izumi, derived from the gem \"pearl\" and an area of Japan known for its clear water (\"Izumi\"). Literally translated, the name means \"fountain of pearls.\" Distributed in the U.S. since 1981, Pearl Izumi USA sponsored the U.S. national team in 1984 and several major trade teams during the mid-'80s, helping the company earn an almost cult-like following among cyclists. The Pearl Izumi USA line is dedicated to meeting the needs of the serious sport enthusiast, including not just cyclists but cross-country skiers, triathletes, duathletes, runners, and more."
