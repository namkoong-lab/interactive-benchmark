        "is an American band from Tacoma, Washington who were active throughout the 1990s. Their style of music is a combination of punk rock and grunge.  In their early days, Seaweed were signed to Washington's Sub Pop, but later released albums on Hollywood Records and Merge Records. Seaweed's contemporaries during the time of their existence included Mudhoney, Samiam, Jawbreaker, and tourmates Superchunk and Quicksand. Their song \"Kid Candy\" was featured as a music video in an episode of Beavis and Butt-head.  The band toured extensively in the United States with Green Day, Superchunk, and Bad Religion, as well as overseas, including shows in Brazil with Garage Fuzz and others in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. They were well known for their cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"Go Your Own Way\", which appeared in the movie Clerks. In 2006, their song \"Losing Skin\" appeared on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 2K7.  On May 15, 2007, the band announced, via MySpace, that they had reformed and were writing a new album, tentatively titled Small Engine Repair. They also announced several live dates. Neither the album nor the tour came to pass, but in 2011 the band did release a 7-inch single on the punk record label No Idea, titled \"Service Deck\" / \"The Weight\". Frontman Stauffer works as a nurse in Northern California and has said \"It’s hard to play a show because it hurts me physically. I only have one show in me. I can’t do two.\""
