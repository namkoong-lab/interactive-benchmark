        "From the Author",
        "Carmedy and Garrett came to me in a dream. It was the only easy thing about them. Finding their story involved researching police methods and culture and deep thought about where our society and technology was headed.Although primarily a mystery, there is an element of social sci-fi, inspired by Max Headroom, and romantic comedy inspired by Castle. I hope you enjoy Kate Garrett and Jake Carmedy as much as I do.",

        "I would like to dedicate this book to: Sam, the barn cat who we thoughtwas a Samantha; Nuptian the orphan kitten, rescued from the gutter; andGeorgette, who saw my sister and me through four pregnancies and was acomfort through my sister's cancer and our family's grief. Asfor the humans, I'd like to thank Nancy O'Neill who has been reading the good, the bad, and the ugly of my stories since... forever. I'd alsolike to thank authors Melodie Campbell, Catherine Astolfo, Janet Bolinand Joan O'Callaghan for their feedback and support, Todd Barselow forbeing such a great editor, and Cheryl Kaye Tardif of Imajin Books, forintroducing Kate Garrett to the world.",
        "About the Author",
        "Alison Bruce has an honors degree in history and philosophy, which has nothing to do with any regular job she's held since. A liberal arts education did prepare her to be a writer, however. She penned her first novel during lectures while pretending to take notes.Her books combine clever mysteries, well-researched backgrounds and a touch of romance. Her protagonists are marked by their strength of character, sense of humor and the ability to adapt (sooner or later) to new situations. Four of her novels have been finalists for genre awards.",
