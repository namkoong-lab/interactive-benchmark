    "features": [
        "REDUCES SAG UNDER LOAD -- Ideal for occasionally hauling or towing varying loads; heavy gauge, calibrated coil spring reduces sag when loaded up to 1,200 lbs. (capacity limited by suspension, tires and transmission; see owner's manual)",
        "EXCEPTIONAL HANDLING -- Tuned specifically for each application, full-displaced valving automatically adjusts to road extremes to provide ride consistency",
        "CONSISTENT RIDE -- OE all-weather fluid contains special modifiers to handle extreme temperatures and PTFE-banded piston helps reduce friction between the piston and pressure tube to enhance responsiveness to changing road surfaces",
        "LONGER SERVICE LIFE -- Self-lubricating fluid seal retains gas and reduces excessive friction against the piston rod to help reduce premature wear while heavy-duty nitrocarburized rod delivers long life",
        "IMPROVES PERFORMANCE -- Nitrogen gas-charge maintains tire-to-road contact for improved ride and handling by reducing aeration and shock fade"
