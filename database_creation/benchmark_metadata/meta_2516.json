        "\"I Highly Recommend this fabulous novel of adventure, strong characters and a solid well-planned storyline filled with more twists and excitement than you can imagine\" - Bubba's Girl, Amazon review",
        "\"I love historical romances, this was no exception. It was so well written, the words flowed across the pages. I have read other books by this talented author, and have enjoyed all of them. She is truly a talented story teller.\" - Kindle Customer, Amazon review",
        "\"Deception, love and treachery are all found in Ava MacAdam's new book, A Countess Captured for the Captain. The book contains not one, but two cliff hangers, keeping the reader on the edge of her/his seat.\" - Teddy, Amazon review",
        "\"This story has a little bit of something that everyone will enjoy. It's has a mixture of Cinderella with the evil stepmother and Pirates of the Caribbean with Captain Nox. There are other interesting issues as well as like a forgotten memory, murder, greed, deception, friendship.\" - Pamela, Amazon review"
