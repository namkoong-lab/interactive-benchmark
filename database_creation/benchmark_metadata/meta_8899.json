        "Kindergarten-Grade 3–Aptly dedicated to Friends of Frog and Toad, this delightful beginning reader introduces two endearing neighbors. In the first chapter, Mouse inadvertently sends all her dirt cascading onto Mole's pristine floor when she sweeps. When he confronts her, they learn that with a bit of ingenuity and cooperation, they can clean both floors and still have time to plant a garden. In The Invitations, the new friends attempt to share a meal, but their innate differences–Mole likes his house damp and dark and eats worms, Mouse likes the warm sun and prefers cheese–make it impossible. Next, the animals find clever ways to reconcile their dissimilarities: Mole presents Mouse with some candles to use when she visits, and she gives him a pair of sunglasses. In the final entry, Mole surprises Mouse with a rowboat. Although it's missing an oar, they manage to have fun. The next day, Mouse has a surprise of her own–a new paddle to make A",

        "Gr. 1-3. Mouse and Mole are neighbors, but it seems their differences outweigh the pluses of friendship. Mouse sweeps her apartment in a tree, and the dirt falls into Mole's house, below. When Mole invites Mouse over, he serves her worms, which Mouse doesn't like. When Mouse invites Mole over, she serves him cheese, which Mole doesn't find appetizing. But step-by-step, the duo works through misunderstandings and disagreements, leading to the strong message that thinking about one another is the way to bolster a relationship. Yee's watercolor-and-ink illustrations are diminutive, but their charm is pervasive. This is not part of an established easy reader series, but it certainly works as one in terms of both subject and design. Kids will develop reading skills and come away with a lesson in friendship.",
