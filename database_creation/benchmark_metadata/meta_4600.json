        "Product Description",
        "Weller transforms hand soldering The art of hand soldering has been around for a very, very long time, thousands of years in fact. But it was only until 1941 that a transformer based instant heating soldering method was de­vel­oped by an im­pa­tient Amer­i­can radio re­pair­man who was tired of sit­ting around wait­ing for his sol­der­ing gun to heat up. Carl E. Weller had to wait until after WWII ended in 1945 to get his Weller Man­u­fac­tur­ing Company going. In 1960, the Weller Man­u­fac­tur­ing Co. in the US patented the “Mag­na­s­tat” sol­der­ing iron which used a mag­netic com­po­nent to reg­u­late the tem­per­a­ture at the iron’s tip. In an ex­pan­sion over­seas beginning in 1959, the Weller GmbH plant in Be­sigheim, Ger­many, along with new plants in other coun­tries, was or­ga­nized to man­u­fac­ture tem­per­a­ture con­trolled irons and sol­der­ing guns for pri­mar­ily in­dus­trial mar­kets through­out Eu­rope and the Near East. Keep­ing pace with the in­creas­ing com­plex­ity of our cus­tomers’ needs, Weller Ger­many be­came the mar­ket leader for de­vel­op­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing hand soldering prod­ucts world­wide. Our prod­ucts were proudly em­bla­zoned with “Made in Ger­many”, sig­ni­fy­ing in­no­va­tion and re­li­a­bil­ity.",
