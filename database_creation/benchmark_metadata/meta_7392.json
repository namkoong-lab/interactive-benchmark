        "Bright, charming and beautiful, Samantha Persaud is in an enviable position. She is the first-born golden child of Kingston's most illustrious Economist, Andrew Persaud and his fashion designer wife, Janise, the granddaughter to magnates, Ravi and Sylvia Persaud. In her own organized, perfectionist manner, the twenty-one year old Sam is well on her way to achieving all the goals she had set for herself when she was just a little girl. And, as icing on the cake, she has the world's most perfect boyfriend -- kind, sweet, considerate Micah, who is hopelessly devoted to her. But, one five-minute conversation all but ruins her perfect world. The well-ordered train of events that was her life has suddenly been derailed, and for the first time, the girl who had always been in total control of her destiny, realizes that she cannot even control her emotions. What is the perfect girl to do when she realizes that life is not \"just perfect\" after all? Just Perfect! is the second title in the Persaud Girl series created by Teisha Mott. Other titles in the series are The Bet, On Time and For Keeps."

        "About the Author",
        "Teisha Mott grew up in Saint Ann, Jamaica, and was an avid reader from age 4. She wrote her first novel at 9 years old because she was \"frustrated with the storyline\" of a book she was reading at the time. Teisha took a break from writing to read for a BSc in Management Studies and Economics, and an MBA in Finance and Banking, both at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. The Persaud Girl series is based on her own experiences at University. Teisha currently lives in Paris, France, and spends her spare time reading and travelling."
