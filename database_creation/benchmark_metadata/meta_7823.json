        "Finally, the real history of Switzerland for clever kids and clever kids-at-heart: dukes slaughtered by filthy peasants, innocent \"witches\" hung up by their necks, buried gold, female mountaineers and, of course, all those murderous cows... Not the fake history of Heidi and William Tell, but Swisstory – from ancient mountain people right up to women's right to vote. Hilariously illustrated by bestselling Swiss artist Michael Meister (The Monster Book of Switzerland), Swisstory is outrageous, fascinating, gruesome – and completely true."

Swisstory: The Untold, Bloody, and Absolutely Real History of Switzerland is her first middle grade book.

She started writing flash fiction and picture books, as she loved the challenge of infusing very short stories with meaning and emotion. Since then, she’s experimented with short stories, poetry, middle grade, and is in the drafting stage for a YA novel. Her stories usually draw on childhood in California, her two years in Peace Corps Thailand, and the past 20+ years in Switzerland.', 'Swisstory: The Untold, Bloody, and Absolutely True History of Switzerland is her first book, illustrated by the incomparable Michael Meister, and published by Bergli Books in 2019. Swisstory won the SCBWI Crystal Kite Award in 2020 for the region Europe/Africa/Latin America.', 'A Monster\\'s Guide to Life...in a Pandemic is a series of four picture books that deal with the \"new normal\" of our daily lives, making the need to wash hands, wear masks, stay at home, and cover our coughs a little more understandable for kids...while giving them a smile or two at the same time. Co-written with Katie Lee Koz, the entire series is available as paperback or Kindle.']}"
