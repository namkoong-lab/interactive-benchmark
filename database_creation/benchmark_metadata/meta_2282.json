I enjoy each and every story...' R. Russell 'Stevens keeps on delivering... This is a great series. Anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes will enjoy the similarities in Stevens' characters and Doyle's. Fresh plots, exotic locale, who-done-its, and a unique set of protagonists. I've read all the Ennin series and look forward to each new adventure. Highly recommended...' Abby Normal 'Entertaining read with Holmesian overtones, but very different setting...' Gerry H 'Once you start this, I'm betting you won't be able to set it down until you finish it...' Judy 'The author weaves intrigue, subterfuge and cunning into a very enjoyable story...' J. Cepeda 'Historical setting and cultural background are excellently researched...' D. Werdin 'Wonderful... Like a Japanese room arrangement with clean lines keeping clutter to a minimum...' AcerAcer 'Ben Stevens is masterful. I can't wait to read his next set of stories...'
