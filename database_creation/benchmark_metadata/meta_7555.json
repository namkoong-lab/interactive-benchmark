        "After long hours of hard work and sleepless nights, Satan has the world by the tail and things are looking good. Until an eight-year-old girl comes up with the idea that praying for the Devils salvation will rid the world of evil.",
        "Of course, everything goes to hell from there. While the Devil attempts to shut this little brat kid up, her sincere compassion for his welfare begins to take its toll on his emotions. In the end, Satan faces a serious problem: Lose everything he has ever worked for, or bring down the child he now loves. The solution? There is only one; Hell must survive."
