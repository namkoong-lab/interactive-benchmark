        "Variegated Spider Plants are one of the easiest houseplants to grow! Spider Plants have impressive leaves up to 18 inches long and a spiky appearance with a beautiful white and green evergreen foliage. The Variegated Spider Plant is the most popular variety of spider plants and is a classic herbaceous perennial. At any time of the year you may see little white flowers blooming from stalk-like branches that’ll sweep away from the main plant in clusters. You’ll know your Spider Plant is thriving if you see plenty of flower babies called pups. Tis plant comes in a 8 inch pot hanging basket and can be kept in any room of your house. They are tolerant of low lighting conditions and need 2-4 hours of sunlight to survive. Known to clean the air and get rid of harmful toxins. Small clusters of flowers appear during the active growing seasons of spring and summer. Spiderplants can grow up to 2-3 feet tall and wide at mature size. It's one of the best houseplants to grow in your bedroom."
