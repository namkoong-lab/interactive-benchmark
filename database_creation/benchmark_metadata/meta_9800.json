        "Is your flag not flying correctly and never taught? You need to install counterweights to your Internal Halyard System. Flagpole Gear has a complete flag pole kit offering that will have you beaming with pride and your flag flying high. Let's look at why counterweights are so vital. HOW DO THEY HELP? Not only do Flagpole's counterweights help with the raising and lowering of your flag, but they are chiefly responsible for ensuring the flag flies and hangs perfectly. No counterweight means your flag will be all over the place. By keeping tension and movement from the wind down to a minimum, the life of your flag is extended. Now that's what we call a bonus! WHAT ARE THEY MADE OF? The rolled steel is coated in plastisol to protect the flag pole from scratches and bumps. Our counterweights come in four color options: white, silver/gray, black, and brown/bronze. We offer three size variations: 3.5 lb, 7 lb, and 14 lb weights. They are designed for flagpoles up to 25 inches in size. HOW TO INSTALL?  It's as easy as using your hands. No tools are necessary. Simply link the eyebolt of the counterweight to the retainer ring, and you're set. WHO ARE WE? Flagpole Gear is a small business based in Bristol, Tennessee, offering quality USA-made flagpole parts, flagpoles, flags, and accessories. Many of our accessories are made in Northeast Tennessee/Southwest Virginia. We offer the best in quality flagpole products and customer service. Our experienced staff will help you find the right products for you, whether it's a complete flagpole kit ready for setup or the right parts to turn that random pipe into a fantastic display for your flag. Get in touch with us. We'd love to meet you and show you our products! Do not attach directly to the flag - this will rip your flag. This is a component part only and the design and engineering of the application are the responsibility of the customer."
