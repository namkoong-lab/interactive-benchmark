        "The stories behind the stories that made headlines across the globe Murderers, hit men, guru cult leaders, school shooters and cold-blooded political killers . . . in this latest expose by AFP's no-holds-barred investigative reporter, Victor Thorn tackles 16 of the most high-profile cases that have shocked citizens in America (and worldwide) for the past 50 years. NEW WORLD ORDER ASSASSINS delves into the sordid details that had previously been suppressed by official government sources and the mainstream media. More importantly, Thorn reaches conclusions that far transcend even those compiled by other conspiracy researchers. The results will make readers reevaluate not only these pivotal events of our history, but also the forces behind them that don't shy away from bloodshed or orchestrating the deaths of presidents and public figures - all to further their nefarious agendas. In other challenging works, Victor Thorn has chronicled 9-11, Waco, OKC, the Clinton body count, Jonestown, Pearl Harbor and the USS Liberty attacks. Now he uncovers a treasure-trove of forbidden history in a new book that shakes the foundation of our popular culture. Be prepared to spiral down a rabbit-hole that delves even deeper into a realm that most people don't even know exists. NEW WORLD ORDER ASSASSINS teems with long-lost secrets that Big Brother from George Orwell's 1984 would have undoubtedly flushed down the Memory Hole. In an age of increased political correctness, Thorn isn't afraid to address taboo subjects or slaughter the government?s most cherished sacred cows."

        "Review",
        "Victor Thorn's latest book, New World Order Assassins, is perhaps his best. In fact, before I was halfway through it I remember remarking, \"This is the real People's History of the United States.\" As the final installment of his New World Order trilogy, Thorn details scores of hidden facts in his analysis of high-profile killings of the 20th century, specifically those occurring between the years 1962 and 1999. In his role as an investigative reporter, Thorn proves, in this reviewer's opinion, through 16 chapters and 264 pages, that what we think we know, we do not. One conclusion is inescapable: none of these murders played out in the ways we were taught, but instead were completely orchestrated by the power elite, a New World Order hit squad, if you will. Thorn tackles the most notorious murders of our time, beginning with the silencing of Hollywood?s platinum blonde starlet, Marilyn Monroe, and ending with the mass murder at Columbine High School. When Thorn tells us in Chapter 1, Presidential Model: The Murder of Marilyn Monroe, that within hours of the her murder Rat Pack actor Peter Lawford-who was married to JFK's sister-placed a frantic call at 6 a.m. to President Kennedy at the White House that lasted for 20 minutes, and that this conversation \"has remained hidden due to 'national security' concerns\" ever since, readers begin their wonderful ride through Thorn's rabbit hole. As one of the country's top conspiracy researchers, Thorn masterfully details how Monroe could never have been allowed to survive past that fateful weekend in August 1962, as she planned on \"calling a press conference on Monday morning [to] blow the lid off the whole damn thing,\" referring of course to secrets of the Kennedy White House that she was privy to. Scores of other hidden facts in this chapter alone leave the reader with at least two undeniable conclusions: Marilyn Monroe did not overdose on drugs, but was viscously murdered to protect the philandering JFK. Secondly, the corporate mainstream media was, and still is, actively involved in this cover-up. Utilizing his encyclopedic knowledge, Thorn writes with the ease of a researcher who has been immersed in this esoteric genre for over 20 years. Each chapter incorporates scores of suppressed facts that allow readers to easily identify common threads running through all of them. Thorn also provides a glossary of terms that helps illuminate similarities and patterns that touch all of these murders, i.e. the tools of the trade of these secret death squads. This glossary includes 'arrests' shortly before the event, 'lurkers' (the same murky faces in the shadows from The Bay of Pigs to 9-11), and 'mind control' techniques like hypnosis and brainwashing performed on the patsies. Through this glossary, Thorn introduces the reader to an entirely new way of viewing these important events while at the same time making a mockery of the pre-packaged, censored 'news' spewed from a corrupt, corporate media that is far too easily swallowed by so many in this country. On each significant event-Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Sirhan Sirhan, John Lennon, Princess Diana, Son of Sam and many others-Thorn categorically proves that everything we know is wrong. Particularly disturbing to even seasoned students of conspiracy, Thorn's chapter on Charles Manson puts his thesis to work: these New World Order murderers will do almost anything to keep the power elite propped up and their war machine humming. Thorn shows that Manson's murder spree, orchestrated by his New World Order puppet masters, served the purpose of turning United States' opinion against the peace movement while insuring many more years of war profits for the power elites. --American Free Press - Dave GaharyIt's difficult to view 'official' history through any prism of credibility after reading Victor Thorn's New World Order Assassins. Time and time again it becomes clear-through Thorn's meticulous research-that collusion between the government and mainstream media forces results in nothing more than bald-faced lies used to cover up the murders of presidents, civil rights leaders, protesters and other pop-culture figures who somehow presented a possible challenge to the ruling elite. Spanning the past 50 years through some of America's most turbulent times, Thorn pro vides an alternative view of pivotal events such as the Kent State massacre that is not only informative, but also entertaining as well. Once I turned the first page, I found it hard to set the book down. As each chapter unfolded-from Marilyn Monroe's unsettling 'suicide' to a mystery man who accumulated hours of extremely rare footage associated with the JFK assassination-Thorn amazes with his breadth of obscure data and bombshell revelations. It didn't take long before I realized that a thread was being woven through each of these traumatic events. In this sense, New World Order Assassins operates on numerous levels by connecting not only the victims, but also those who ultimately directed these world-changing murders. While compromised television newsmen continue, even to this day, to blame these murderous acts on disaffected 'lone nuts,' there's no doubt that an intricate web of illusion has been woven to protect the responsible parties (i.e., those with blood on their hands). Whether examining the crosshairs placed on the head of John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, John Lennon or Malcolm X, this book proves that the same cabal of globalist evil-doers was behind the successful or unsuccessful plots to eliminate these men. And, unlike other authors or broadcasters who merely speak in general terms without getting specific (e.g., the 'Illuminati' did it), Thorn unflinchingly names the guilty parties, from J. Edgar Hoover all the way up to the criminal state of Israel. On a final note, prior to reading New World Order Assassins, I finished another AFP publication, Pat Shannan's Everything They Ever Told Me Was a Lie. This book complements NWO Assassins, even though it uses a variance in approach, and even wider ranging subject matter. These authors provide a new look at 20th century history. But remember, Shannan and Thorn have minds of their own and aren't afraid to enter uncharted territory. In a cyber-world where all of us are inundated with an overabundance of information, it's refreshing to read a book that focuses with such laser-like intensity. Rather than straying off on tangents, Thorn never deviates from his goal at hand, which is to expose the New World Order elite who-when threatened-don't hesitate in killing those who could potentially undermine their nefarious agenda. After finishing this book, I'll forever view history through a different lens. --The Council Courier - John Tiffany",
