        "\"You know when you marry for convenience & swear up and down that you won't catch feelings and end up catching feelings? Well Dante & Raquel were no different & I ate that right up.\" -",
        "Madison",
        "\"I definitely meant it when I said that this is a series from what I now know is one of my favorite authors!! Holy heck, this book was epic!!\" -",
        "Leah",
        "\"I really liked EVERYTHING that happened between Dante & Raquel, from the moment they \"meet\", the way their marriage started, to how easy it is to realize how much they are interested in the other. Their chemistry is powerful, amazing and explosive, they are very funny, sensual, tender and charming, and one of my favorite Lilian Harris couples. \" -",
        "Laura",
        "\"Lilian Harris has won me over once again with The Devil's Pawn because this book is so incredibly good that I was able to finish it within one day. I can't even describe how much in love I am with Dante and Raquel's story because they gave me exactly what I was hoping for!\" -",

        "\"Hey.\" I reach out my hand for hers, tucking her fingers in my palm. \"It's gonna be okay.\"\"No, it won't.\" Bitterness grows in her eyes. \"It'll never be okay.\"\"You don't know that. You never know where your life will take you.\" I glance at her in between focusing on the road. \"I mean, did you ever expect to meet a handsome man at four in the morning?\"She half laughs, half cries while swiping under her eye. \"No, I actually didn't.\"\"So you do think I'm handsome.\" I lift a brow, my lips turning with a grin as I catch the light in her eyes from the smile now on her face.\"You're okay, I guess,\" she giggles pitifully, sniffling and taking her hand back. \"A lot better than the man I'm being forced to marry, that's for sure.\"\"It's funny.\" I pause, setting my plan in motion. \"You want to get out of a marriage, and I want to get into one.\"\"What do you mean?\" Her head tilts to the side, eyes laserfocused on me. \"Well...\" I make a left turn, cruising down a bare street. \"There's this property I badly want to secure. But the problem is, the owner won't sell to me.\"\"Why?\" Her brows furrow. \"I have to prove I'm a happily married man first.\"Her eyes widen. \"That's crazy.\"\"Yep.\" I shrug. \"The owner is old and has his rules. Something about a married man being better suited to take care of the house. If I want his place, I have less than a week to find a fake wife who can live with me for three months and pretend to be mine.\" I turn right, nearing my house. \"I kind of told him I was already engaged and the wedding is in two weeks.\" Her mouth falls open. \"Now you see the problem?\" I grin.She nods with a nervous laugh. \"A little.\"\"He wants to see the marriage certificate once it's finalized,\" I explain further. \"And after he's happy that I'm married for three months, he'll sign the contract for the property.\" I hope she buys this, or I'm going to have to do what Dom will be doing to Chiara tonight: lock her away in a room until she accepts her new world.\"Do you have anyone in mind?\" Her eyes narrow. Yes. You. \"Not yet. It's a hard ask, even with all the money I'd offer her in return.\" And the pot has been sweetened.\"Money?\" Her tone rises with excitement. \"How much money?\" \"I think a million tax-free would be fair. What do you think?\"Her brows shoot up. \"I'll do it!\"\"What?\" I turn my head to her as I park the car in my driveway. \"Are you serious? You should really think about it,\" I push, but internally I'm grinning like a bastard, knowing I have her where I want her.\"I don't need to think about it.\" She reaches for my arm, clinging to my bicep with all the desperation slinking in her eyes. I feel it and hate that I do.I'd let you fly away if I could, little bird, but I can't. You're mine now.Will she be this desperate to escape me when she learns of her new fate? It shouldn't matter to me. None of it matters. Not her pain, and not what I have to do. It's all irrelevant. The only thing that I care about is avenging the deaths of my family.\"Look...\" She drops her arm away from me. \"I don't have anywhere to go. If I go home, I'm afraid my mother will send me to the altar the next hour. And my fiancé? He's a real jerk. I'm scared of what he'll do once he gets his hands on me. So even if you're some crazy psycho killer...\" She laughs. \"That's okay. I was considering offing myself tonight, so you'd be saving me the trouble.\"",
