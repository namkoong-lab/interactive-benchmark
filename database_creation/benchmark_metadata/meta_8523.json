        "From the Inside Flap",
        "Wyatt Dorren, U.L.F. team leader, is the rarest of breeds: an ex-convict who has become a productive member of society, trapping U.L.F.'s- Unidentified Life Forms- from newly discovered planets and returning with them for exhibition at the Interplanetary Zoo. Wyatt inspires loyalty and courage in his team members, but nothing from his dark past, or his years of trapping dangerous aliens, can prepare Wyatt for what's in store now.The victim of a conspiracy, believing that he is on a regular hunt, Wyatt is sent on a one-way trip to a planet more fundamentally hostile than any he's seen before. Wyatt must uncover the plot and help his new rag-tag team of trappers learn to fight for survival while sniffing out the traitor in their midst. Could it be Chris or Alex, the seemingly inept rookies? Kit, the unrepentant criminal? Par, the charming Swede? Byron or Bobby, whom Wyatt has trusted for years? Or could it be Kate, the young biologist who seems to have no place at all on this expedition? Regardless of their motivations and differences, the team is forced to work together to elude the hostile flora and fauna of a nightmarish world. Without a working ship, Wyatt must somehow find them a way back to Eartheach team member will need to draw on courage and a resourcefulness they didn't know they had, as the hunters become the hunted on this alien world. Some of the team may not survive, and Wyatt soon realizes that if he wants to have a future, he must confront his secretive past.In his captivating first novel, Stuart Clark has crafted an innovative and riveting masterpiece. Project U.L.F. is a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end, with surprises around every corner that will leave you desperately turning the pages to find out what will happen next."

To those not intimate with British geography, that can more simply be described as Greater London.', 'Science, particularly Biology, always interested Stuart and after school, he went on to Bristol University where he graduated with a BSc in Microbiology.', 'He worked for two years as a technical author for a large scientific publishing company before deciding that he really wanted to go back to University and do a Masters degree in Science Communication, which he completed at Imperial College, London.', 'After years of intermittent study and work, Stuart decided to take a sabbatical and spent almost two years experiencing the sights and sounds of Australasia and South-East Asia. He spent a year of that time living and working in Sydney, Australia.', \"When he's not working or writing, Stuart spends his time scuba diving and attempting to play golf.\", 'Stuart emigrated to the United States in 2005 and now lives with his wife and daughter in New Jersey.']}"
