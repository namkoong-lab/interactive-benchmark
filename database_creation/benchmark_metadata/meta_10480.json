        "The complete LP Big Band Bossa Nova (Mercury SR-60751), which marks Quincy Jones' fi rst incursion into the Brazilian music genre. It presents an orchestra fi lled with great stars such as Clark Terry, Phil Woods, Paul Gonsalves, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Lalo Schifrin, and Jim Hall. As a bonus, we have included Quincy's previous LP, The Quintessence (Impulse AS-11), in its entirety, as well as a complete session recorded in between both albums, from which one song, \"\"Shag Nasty\"\", has never appeared before on CD until now."
