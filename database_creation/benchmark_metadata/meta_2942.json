        "This book teaches girls how to spot bullying and how to stand up and speak out against it. Quizzes, quotes from other girls, and \"what do you do?\" scenarios present advice in an age-appropriate, digestible way. The message in this book is that there is no one right way to deal with bullying. Instead, there are lots of options for girls to try, from ignoring a bully and trying a few clever comebacks to reporting bullying to a trusted adult. Readers learn how to stand up for others and be a good friend, too. The book ends with a pledge girls can sign, plus tear-out tips for girls to share with their parents."
