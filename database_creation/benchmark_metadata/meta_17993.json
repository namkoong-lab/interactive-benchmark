        "The 3.5 ounce TAP Extreme Duty Weighted Ball is a pliable, sand-filled ball that is squeezable and easy to handle. It is the approximate size of a baseball and can be used for throwing drills. These balls were designed to be used in close quarters or in environments where rebounding is not desired and can be used as tools to improve arm strength and increase arm speed through the use of a weighted ball throwing program (not included). It is an excellent tool for providing weighted resistance through the full range of motion used in throwing. The 3.5 ounce ball is lighter than a baseball and can be used as an under load device for throwing to provide feedback regarding arm speed potential. The ball can be thrown against hard surfaces, padding, or net structures. These balls should be used with proper instruction and supervision in areas where there are no sharp edges or points."
