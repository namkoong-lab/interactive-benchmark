    "description": [
        "An ACDelco GM Original Equipment Fuel Injector is an electro-magnetic valve that meters fuel into the engine’s intake manifold or cylinders for combustion, and is a GM-recommended replacement for your vehicle’s original component. The engine management computer operates the injector by applying an electric current to the injector solenoid winding-this causes the needle valve to open, and allows the pressurized fuel to be atomized into the intake airstream. This original equipment fuel injector has been manufactured to fit your GM vehicle, providing the same performance, durability, and service life you expect from General Motors."
