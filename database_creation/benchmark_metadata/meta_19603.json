        "Noel Coward was a master playwright whose prodigious talent dominated the theatre of the 1920s and 30s.",
        "\"The Vortex\" made him an immediate hit and controversial sensation. \"Hay Fever,\" \"Private Lives,\" and \"Design for Living\" are as popular today as when they were first performed. His series of one-acts \"Tonight at 8:30\" which he performed with Gertrude Lawrence have become a treasure trove for modern theatre companies.",
        "This DVD collection features star-studded BBC productions of Coward's full-length plays, one-acts and short stories plus bonus features including several radio plays, interviews and profiles of Coward. It's a must-own set for lovers of great theatre."
