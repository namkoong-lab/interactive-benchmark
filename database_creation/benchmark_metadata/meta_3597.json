        "Anyone who knits or crochets knows that there are two challenges one routinely faces as a textile addict--finding the perfect yarn and tools for a project, and finding a place to store them afterwards! While we don't carry yarn, StoreSMART's Circular Knitting Needle and Crochet Hook Pockets are a fantastic solution for a tricky storage problem. Each 6 7/8\" x 7 3/8\" 8-gauge vinyl pocket is the perfect size for your coiled-up circular knitting needles or crochet hooks. Secure your tools with the resealable zipper, and then use the two holes to store the pockets in any standard 3-ring binder. Instead of letting your supplies create a knotted mess in a drawer or box, keep them neat and organized on a shelf. There--now you have more mental energy for the never-ending yarn hunt! Note: Knitting needles not included. Product Features: Crafted of crystal clear 8-gauge vinyl. Red resealable zipper keeps needles in, and dirt out. Includes holes for use with three-ring binders. Overall size: 6 7/8\" x 7 3/8\". Inside capacity: 6 ½\" x 5\". Proudly manufactured in the USA. Suggestions for Use: Great for use with circular knitting needles, crochet hooks, and other craft tools. Organize your needles and hooks by size! Simply label each pocket with a permanent marker or print-out label. Your embroidery and cross-stitching floss, whether on a bobbin or in a skein, are right at home in these pockets."
