        "The once magnificent, now ruined, cities that cluster along the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey are reminders of a civilization that produced the first Hellenic enlightenment, giving birth to Homer, Herodotus, and the first philosophers of nature. John Freely brings this magnificent civilization to life as he recounts the epic tragedy of the Greeks in Anatolia, starting with the Trojan War and culminating with the period after the Turkish War of Independence. For history buffs, travelers, and anyone interested in Greek culture, Freely’s firsthand experience of this culture and region coupled with his passion for storytelling are a winning combination."
