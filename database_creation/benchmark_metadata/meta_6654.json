        "SIZING",
        "Since our collars are made to order, we do ask that you double check the size of your pet's neck prior to ordering. Please allow 2 fingers of extra room around your pet's neck. Measuring your pet's neck is the only true way to determine if our collars will fit your pet. There is no standard sizing chart for collars and every brand will fit differently. Please review our 2nd photo for our personal size chart.  🐶",
