        "About the Author",
        "A Montlake Romance and Kindle Worlds multipublished author Carolyn Hughey, and her alter ego K. T. Roberts write in two different genres. They currently have thirteen novels published. While Carolyn writes humorous contemporaries with a side dish of romance, K.T. focuses on mystery with a catchy twist. Truth be told though, K.T. also published two contemporaries with a little sizzle because Carolyn couldn't bring herself to do it. Originally a Jersey girl, Carolyn lives with her real-life hero, Bob, in Arizona. They have four children. As a former chef, when Carolyn isn't writing some zany thing one of her characters has done, she's either writing about recipes or killing someone off. In between, she's studying her craft, or whipping up some gastronomic delight for family and friends. Visit Carolyn at her website at http: //carolynhughey.com, and while you're at it, drop her a note. She loves to hear from her readers. You can also read her blog at http: //www.booksbycarolyn.blogspot.com, and http: //thewriteauthors.com where Carolyn has joined forces with seven other authors who blog on a variety of subjects.",

Roberts loves all things mystery and thriller, including cozy mysteries.

Penning her first crime novel in 2012, the creation of the Kensington-Gerard Detective series was born. Now working on her fifth novel in the series, Sleeping with the Enemy will be released in 2021.', 'K. T. finds inspiration from researching true crimes and is passionate about writing suspenseful novels with crazy twists. Twists you never see coming. She knows her novel is good when she finds herself so wrapped up in her stories, the only thing that calms her down is a handful of chocolates. Her inspiration for her first crime novel was created through a conversation of idle gossip, and the rest is history.', 'Her thriller novels have elements of mystery, suspense, and romance. She is also the author of the Chef’s Toque series, the Cape May Capers series, and a few Christmas romances.', \"When she's not absorbed in a novel or working on her next thriller mystery, her favorite pastime is utilizing her culinary skills of creating pastries or gourmet meals for family and friends.\", 'More information about her books at www.ktrobertsmysteries.com', 'Follow her on social media:', 'Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ktrobertsmysteries1', 'K.T.
