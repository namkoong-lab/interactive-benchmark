        "In Goodbye Hangovers, Hello Life, the first book on recovery specifically for women, Jean Kirkpatrick tells how she achieved sobriety. She explains the special problems of the woman alcoholic, and challenges some of the premises of Alcoholics Anonymous, an organization founded by and for men that she believes fails to address the specific needs of women. Instead of harping on past problems and behavior, the Women For Sobriety program focuses on the future, showing women how to build up their emotional strength, self-esteem, and positive approach to life essential to recovery."

        "Herself a recovered alcoholic, Kirkpatrick makes it clear at the outset that female alcoholics are different from their male counterpartstheir problems are more complex and acute. Society tends to condition women into being passive, inhibited and lacking in self-identity, she observes; thus they are \"very poorly equipped with the stuff recovery is made of,\" namely the strength to be independent and self-reliant. But Kirkpatrick, who directs Women for Sobriety, outlines that organization's program of recovery, stressing meditation, nutrition and methods of heightening self-esteem, plus a six-point guide to postive thinking, chief among which is \"I am what I think.\" Also included are interviews with female alcoholics, which underline the author's message that hope exists for women with this affliction.

        "Written for the estimated 5 million women alcoholics in the United States, this book vividly describes the pain of alcoholism, stages in the recovery, and keys to \"the good life.\" Kirkpatrick, founder of the Women for Sobriety support group program, outlines steps women must take to recover fully, including understanding depression, overcoming guilt and low self-esteem, and developing tools for living the \"good life\"exercise, meditation, and nutrition. While the author often seems to be looking for causes for the drinking outside the alcoholic, her recommendation is to \"take charge of your life\"the shaping of ourselves into the best we have to offer and then offering it to others.\" This is a fine book for the woman in trouble with alcohol and looking for help.
