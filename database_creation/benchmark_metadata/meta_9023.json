        "How did America transform itself, in a relatively short time, from a land inhabited by hunter-gatherer and agricultural Native American societies into the most powerful industrial nation on earth? You'll find out in LIBERTY, EQUALITY, POWER: A HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, CONCISE 5e. The authors tell this story through the lens of three major themes: liberty, equality, and power. You'll learn not only the impact of the notions of liberty and equality, but also how dominant and subordinate groups have affected and been affected by the ever-shifting balance of power."

        "\"My students tell me that they read this book and that they enjoy reading it. And many of my students are not readers. The design and the coverage make it one of the best textbooks on the market.\"\"...Liberty, Equality, Power allows me to provide a highly readable text, from a team of top-flight scholars, at a price that meets my students' budgets.\"\"I...have found [the authors'] writing lucid, cogent, and readily accessible to students. They do not condescend to, nor patronize, their readers while consistently delivering timely scholarship in a highly readable format.\"\"The authors have created a text that balances the current trends in historical scholarship with the traditional narrative style that has the greatest impact on college students. People long dead come alive in Liberty, Equality, and Power\"\"History Through Film: I LOVE THIS!!! Anything multimedia, in particular movies are a great addition to teaching modern students.\"",
