        "“Throughout these pages, Allison beautifully demonstrates how we can all jump high but still land gently in life. With her road-tested and client-beloved steps, she encourages us to think bigger, act with greater intention, and love deeply, starting with ourselves.”",
        "—Farnoosh Torabi, bestselling author, financial journalist, and host of the podcast So Money",
        "“Christiane Northrup once wrote: ‘Every woman who heals herself helps heal all the women who came before her and all those who will come after her.’ Allison’s straightforward approach to bringing self-care to the forefront of our lives helps take something we all know we need more of and makes it darn near impossible to not achieve! Just the act of reading the creative ways to enjoy self-care in her book is healing in and of itself, so it’s mind-blowing to think how a woman's (or any person’s) health and well-being will be positively changed after practicing several of these engaging journal prompts! If you’re looking for quick but effective ways to create more meaning and authentic joy in your life, you don’t have to look further—start right now, today! Your hormones and health will thank you!”",
        "—Lizzy Swick, MS, RDN, women's health and hormone specialist",
        "“This journal is a warm embrace and juicy dive into deeply knowing ourselves as a practice of self-care. Allison masterfully meets us where we are and invites us to explore our relationship with self, our community, and our world. Through thoughtful language, she creates a safe space with her kindness, validation, and encouragement to help connect us with our innermost being, which allows us to more richly connect with each other.”",
