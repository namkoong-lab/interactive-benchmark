        "TIPS FOR STAMPING",
        "1)Prepare transparent adhesive tape, it is easy to clean the stamper with the tape. (The choice of nail polish,it depends on the viscosity and concentration of the polish,we’d better chose the stamping polish to operate it.) 2)Smoothing the scraper -The new scraper maybe not so smooth, we can smooth some time before using; -We should try different angle and different strength to scrape to get a perfect stamping effect. 3)Stamp along the arc of the stamper, press on one direction only one time. Try more times with different degree and different polish ,you will get a easy nail art ! 4)For beginner,",
