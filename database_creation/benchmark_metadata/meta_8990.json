        "The Voltarian invaders are getting down and dirty . . . in the deadliest of games.",
        "The price: Planet Earth.",
        "Voltarian Royal Officer Jettero Heller has heart, nerve and a quick mind on his side. His archenemy Soltan Gris has cunning, ruthlessness and a devious plan on his. But what neither of them has is money—and without that they may as well pack up and go back to Voltar. Because as every earthling knows—no pay, no play.",
        "Heller’s solution is a weekend in Atlantic City, where he puts a new spin on gambling. He’s got a foolproof system, guaranteeing that he’ll win every bet he makes. Into this world of dirty money, dirty tricks and dirty games, the wildest of wild cards is about to change everything. Countess Krak is back—and this voluptuous Voltarian, condemned murderess and love of Heller’s life could prove to be the key player in coming to grips with a FORTUNE OF FEAR.",

        "—Anne McCaffrey",
        "“I loved Mission Earth. The CIA will hate it. Hubbard has produced a real knee-slapper. . .Few writers have had the knack of making a serious philosophical point without ever stopping to preach, without ever slowing the action for an instant.”",
        "—Ray Faraday Nelson",
        "“Hubbard not only broke all the rules but he blazed a new literary path when he completed the monumental 1.2-million-word Mission Earth in slightly less than eight months.”",
        "—William J. Widder",

        "—Jim Marrs",
        "“Mr. Hubbard has managed in this book to bring out things that were not always talked about in those days when he put pen to paper. But now are the most important issues on this earth. . . . He could look ahead into the future and what he's come up with is a fascinating story.”",
        "—Jim Dale",
        "“A superbly imaginative, intricately plotted invasion of Earth.”",
        "—Chicago Tribune",

        "About the Author",
        "With 19 New York Times bestsellers and more than 230 million copies of his works in circulation, L. Ron Hubbard is among the most acclaimed and widely read authors of our time. As a leading light of American Pulp Fiction through the 1930s and '40s, he is further among the most influential authors of the modern age. Indeed, from Ray Bradbury to Stephen King, there is scarcely a master of imaginative tales who has not paid tribute to L. Ron Hubbard."
