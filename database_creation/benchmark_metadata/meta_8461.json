        "Urban conflagrations, such as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and the Great Boston Fire the following year, terrorized the citizens of nineteenth-century American cities. However, urban rebirth in the aftermath of great fires offered a chance to shape the future. Ultimately residents and planners created sweeping changes in the methods of constructing buildings, planning city streets, engineering water distribution systems, underwriting fire insurance, and firefighting itself.",
        "Crucible of Fire",
        "describes how the practical knowledge gained from fighting nineteenth-century fires gave form and function to modern fire protection efforts. Changes in materials and building design resulted directly from tragedies such as fires in supposedly fireproof hotels. Thousands of buildings burned, millions of dollars were lost, the fire insurance industry faltered, and the nature of volunteerism changed radically before municipal authorities took the necessary actions. The great fires formed a crucible of learning for firefighters, engineers, architects, underwriters, and citizens. Veteran firefighter Bruce Hensler shows how the modern American fire service today is a direct result of the lessons of history and a rethinking of the efficacy of volunteerism in fighting fires.",
        "Crucible of Fire",
        "is an eye-opening look at today’s fire service and a thorough examination of what firefighters, civic leaders, and ordinary citizens can do to protect their homes and communities from the mistakes of the past."

Training in small city departments and the volunteers was still generally on-the-job. Education for firefighters, beyond high school, was not considered necessary. I leaned forward into the job with enthusiasm and I took chances. In time, through acquired experience, education, and training I leaned how to be a smart firefighter and still be aggressive.', 'I believe that firefighters are the tip of sword and essential to the public fire protection system, but they could not do their job effectively without engineered hydrant systems, well designed buildings, top notch fire apparatus, and safety equipment. So be advised that I cover those aspects In this book with the intent to give credit where credit is due. Thus this book takes a broad view of public fire protection acknowledging the work of fire underwriters, planners, engineers, and architects.', 'If you are looking for an adventure read about soot-covered firemen with black snot running from their noses there are many other great books that will fill that need better than this book. I encourage you to seek out and read those other authors and forget about this book.', 'Update, June 2021.', 'On the 10th anniversary of publication, I want to thank those who have read my book. I also want to thank Potomac Books for having faith in my ability to write a book and to The University of Nebraska Press for keeping it in publication all these years.']}"
