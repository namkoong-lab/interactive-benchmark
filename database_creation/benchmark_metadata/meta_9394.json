        "Fiction. WE portrays the havoc that the threat of an immigration raid wreaks upon a surprisingly wide diversity of the residents of a suburban American community. Told in a series of vignettes that dip in and out of the lives of not only those in danger of deportation, but also of the American citizen neighbors with whom their lives are intertwined, it ultimately reveals how rapidly labels and categories and \"us vs. them\" divisions pale in comparison to all that even the most seemingly dissimilar amongst them have in common in the universes sealed within their skin."
