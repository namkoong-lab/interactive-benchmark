        "“Dr. Fotuhi has summarized the latest discoveries which show how we can grow our brain bigger and stronger through simple lifestyle changes.” -- Mehmet Oz, M.D., professor and vice chair of surgery, New York Presbyterian/ColumbiaWant to grow a bigger brain, improve your memory, and save your brain from premature aging? Read this book and follow Fotuhi’s advice. I do! -- Jean Carper, bestselling author of Stop Aging Now!, Your Miracle Brain, and 100 Simple Things You Can Do to Prevent Alzheimer'sEmerging evidence suggests that brain health and performance can be enhanced by specific lifestyle choices. In this book, Dr. Fotuhi translates the latest scientific literature into simple layman’s terms and offers up actionable plans. If you want to think more clearly and effectively, this is the book for you. -- Barbara S. Slusher, Ph.D., Director, Brain Science Institute NeuroTranslational Program, Associate Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine“In Boost Your Brain, Dr. Fotuhi brings his twelve-week brain fitness program-a sort of boot camp for the brain-to readers; translating into plain English the groundbreaking discoveries that allow you to make your brain years, or decades, younger, and tap into the potential of your amazing brain.” -- MICHAEL F. ROIZEN, M.D., (from the Foreword) author of RealAge and coauthor of YOU: The Owner's ManualBoost Your Brain is a phenomenal book that teaches readers how to improve their brain health and memory. Being a two-time USA Memory Champion, and having boosted my brain to champion status, I can say that Dr. Fotuhi touches on all the important keys to developing a powerful brain. -- Nelson Dellis, two-time USA Memory ChampionFor twenty-five years, I have marveled at Majid Fotuhi’s ability to speak to every type of audience. We can have no better guide to the rapidly evolving fields of cognition and memory, as well as the actions that each of us can take to maximize brain function. -- Carl Rosow, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Harvard Medical School",

He completed his neurology residency and fellowship training at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Fotuhi's initial clinical research at Johns Hopkins focused on basic brain neurochemistry and on finding effective ways to prevent dementia. More specifically, he worked on longitudinal studies to determine the beneficial role of vitamins and natural supplements in maintaining cognitive function and brain health.\", 'His recent research on the effects of aging on the brain has shown that baby-boomers can indeed increase the size of their hippocampus, the part of brain that is critical for short term memory. He has published his findings in prestigious journals such as Journal of Neuroscience, The Lancet, Nature, Neurology, Neuron, and Proceedings of National Academy of Science. His articles have been cited by thousands of scientists around the world. Based on his research at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, he has developed a 3-month \"Brain Fitness Program\" to help middle age people sharpen their memory quickly and keep their brain young for years to come.', \"Dr. Fotuhi has dedicated much of his time to educating the public about issues related to memory and aging. He has been the visiting professor and keynote speaker for conferences in China, Japan, Canada, Israel and other countries around the world. His first book, The Memory Cure: How to Protect Your Brain Against Memory Loss and Alzheimer's Disease, has sold more than 100,000 copies. His second book, The New York Times Puzzles to Keep Your Brain Young: The 6-Step Age-Defying Program, is the focus of his popular PBS program called Fight Alzheimer's Early. He has been interviewed and featured in Boston Globe, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, ABC News, CNN, Discovery Channel, Forbes, USA Today, and The Dr. Oz Show. Dr. Fotuhi's third book, Boost Your Brain, will be released on Sept 10th, 2013.\", \"Dr. Fotuhi has been a popular lecturer at both Johns Hopkins and Harvard Medical School for 25 years. He is the recipient of the American Academy of Neurology Teaching Award and numerous other awards for his contributions to the field of brain science and Alzheimer's research.\"]}"
