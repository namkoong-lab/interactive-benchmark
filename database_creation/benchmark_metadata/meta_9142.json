        "The most famous of all the Green Lanterns, Hal Jordan put on the Lantern’s ring for the first time in 1959. Reinvented from the original 1940s crime-fighting Green Lantern by John Broome, this new Green Lantern was a science-fiction adventurer. He battled aliens, giant monsters and wealthy sociopaths out to steal his ring, and fended off the efforts of his love, Carol Ferris, to discover his true identity. As the Green Lantern of the Silver Age of comic books, Hal Jordan captured the imagination of a space-minded society of the ’50s and ’60s.   GREEN LANTERN: THE SILVER AGE VOLUME 2 collects the adventures of Hal Jordan as he takes on the responsibility of the ring and the lantern in GREEN LANTERN #10-22."

        "About the Author",
        "Born in 1913, John Broome started out his writing career selling science fiction stories to the pulp magazines of the 1930s. His agent for those stories was Julius Schwartz, who in 1945 would join DC Comics' staff as an editor and, over the next forty years, be responsible for some of the most innovative comics of his time. Broome's first comic book sale was to Fawcett Comics for the South Seas adventure strip, Lance O'Casey. More work for Fawcett followed, including on CAPTAIN MARVEL, before World War II interrupted his writing career. When he was released from the service, he looked up his old friend Julius Schwartz at DC and, for more than twenty years, made his creative home there, writing countless scripts for numerous features, including the Golden Age Green Lantern, Justice Society of America, Captain Comet, the Silver Age revival of Green Lantern, the Atomic Knights, Star Hawkins, Rex the Wonder Dog, Detective Chimp and a variety of science fiction tales. Broome retired from comic books in the 1970s and settled in Japan where he taught English. John Broome died in Thailand in March 1999."
