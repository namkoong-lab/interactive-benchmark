        "\"Hardly the familiar post-apocalyptic novel of zombie attacks and desperate efforts to rebuild civilization--[",
        "All is Silence",
        "is] a personal story of a scared girl and the survivors she finds in the ruins of her world. Lizzie is hard-edged and gritty, vulnerable and kind. Her personality is so compelling that she grabs you by the heart and pulls you along until it's three in the morning and the story's over and you just want to read more.\" ~",
        "Don Sakers -",
        "Analog Science Fiction",
        "A fast paced, adrenaline soaked novel. . . . Lizzie, or Crazy Lizzie to her friends, makes for a rather dark character. A former cutter who has occasional suicidal tendencies, she nonetheless manages to be very compelling. In fact, all the characters manage to be interesting. . . . Slater is a very talented writer and he slowly ramps up the action and suspense until you're flipping the pages almost too fast to read the words. . . . I'll definitely be waiting (impatiently) for the sequel. ~",

        "\"Slater has created a post-apocalyptic world that is inwardly and outwardly consistent by paying attention to the details. Lizzie, the anti-hero is the tough chick with a heart of gold. She survives the pandemic apocalypse that wipes out 95 percent of the world's population [and] captures the reader by being so human that you can't help being sucked into her world.... like Rowling and Suzanne Collins, writes about young people, but engages a wider audience, ... furthering understanding of what it is like to be young in this difficult world.\"",

        "From the Author",
        "For 20+ years, I've worked with students who were dealt a challenging hand, who didn't have a voice, and had trouble finding themselves in the world. These kids often don't read much, partly, I think, because they rarely see people like them in fiction. So, yes, I wrote a trilogy for folks who don't read! ;-)Many young adult books are light and fun; protagonists are often white and/or male. Though this is changing, there are not enough strong females characters who effect change in the world around themselves. I created this universe in a story in 1995. In 2011, when I came up with the idea of placing Lizzie in this universe, everything clicked.",
        "From the Back Cover",
        "In a future that could be ours, Lizzie, a suicidal teen-age girl, barely navigates her own life. Then everything falls apart. In an apocalyptic land nearly deserted by disease, she lacks reasons to live until a shocking turn of events reveals a phone number. Her call pulls her dangerously cross-country to meet a stranger she thought was dead.",
