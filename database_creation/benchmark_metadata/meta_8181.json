        "This sturdily bound paperback is equally substantial inside. Augmented by full-color identification photographs, the text, in an easy-on-the-eye arrangement on the page, presents 200 of the best superfoods, which are defined here as “foods that contain a high level of essential nutrients and other compounds that may benefit your health.” There is no need to fear that superfoods, then, are grim, unattractive, bad-tasting items that are “good for you.” No, we’re talking about oranges, peas, walnuts, olive oil, game, salmon, tuna, and even dark chocolate. Each profile includes a discussion of the “healthy evidence”: a couple of paragraphs about why the food item is so good for human consumption. A “making the most” paragraph concerns how to best use the item in one’s diet. This book would be at home both on the cookery/nutrition reference shelf and in the personal library for menu planning. --Brad Hooper",

        "2010-12-03)Reinhard, a registered dietitian, compiled this guide to 200 of the most nutrient-dense foods. The book is divided by food type with sections on vegetables and fruit, legumes, nuts and oils, herbs and spices, grains, beverages and treats, nutritional supplements, and, yes, meat! Each entry contains a brief history of the food; a reference to a medical study; vitamin, mineral, and phytochemical content; and tips on usage. Many of the foods are familiar, such as olive oil, lentils, and almonds. Lesser-known ingredients such as goji berries and spirulina are also highlighted... A solid beginner's reference, especially for those seeking the authority of medical studies. (Rukshana Singh",
