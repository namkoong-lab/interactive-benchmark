        "Douglas Pike is no longer the murderous hustler he was in his youth, but reforming hasn't made him much kinder. He's just living out his life in his Appalachian hometown, working odd jobs with his partner, Rory, hemming in his demons the best he can. And his best seems just good enough until his estranged daughter overdoses and he takes in his twelve-year-old granddaughter, Wendy.",
        "Just as the two are beginning to forge a relationship, Derrick Kreiger, a dirty Cincinnati cop, starts to take an unhealthy interest in the girl. Pike and Rory head to Cincinnati to learn what they can about Derrick and the death of Pike’s daughter, and the three men circle, evenly matched predators in a human wilderness of junkie squats, roadhouse bars, and homeless Vietnam vet encampments"

        "Imagine Doug Pike’s surprise when, out of the blue, he becomes the sole custodian of his rather smart-mouthed 12-year-old granddaughter, Wendy. He hasn’t seen the girl for half her life, but, after her mother’s unexpected death, Pike is the only relative she has. Curious, Pike digs into his estranged daughter’s death and uncovers a nasty little story involving, among other things, a relentless—and frequently ruthless—cop who seems unusually concerned about little Wendy. Pike finds that he’s going to need to reconnect with his own seedy, violent past if he’s going to protect the girl (not to mention himself). This is a contemporary thriller that should satisfy any reader’s requirements for violence, tough characters, and sharp-edged dialogue. --David Pitt",

One of his earliest and happiest memories is of standing by the side of a country road with his mother, hitchhiking to parts unknown. Since then, he’s been a factory grunt, a vacuum salesman, a convalescent, a high-school dropout, a graduate student, a semi-truck loader, an activist, a kitchen-table gunsmith, a squatter, a college professor, a dishwasher, a technical writer, and a petty thief.']}"
