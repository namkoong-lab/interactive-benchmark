        "Mini JAM is a great choice not only as a first amp, but also as a warm-up amp on the road or in your rehearsal space, for practicing using the songs as a improvising machine, or even as a music box. It's sure to have a long and warm relationship with any guitarist, Powerful Rhythm Features: As its name suggests, the Mini JAM is a guitar amp that includes some cool song built-in for you to JAM with. The 32 songs patterns include not just standards such Rock, Blue; but also RnB, Jazz, Ballad, Funk, Metal and even some Hip Hop styles. In addition, each style provides four types of variation, for a total of 32 songs variations. The tempo let you easily adjust the speed of the backing track, best for you to practice from a very slow speed to normal or even faster, Enhanced Amp Performance: The Mini JAM also has a lot to offer as a guitar amp. To begin with, there's a full complement of gain, tone, and volume controls, letting you dial-in a broad range of sounds to suite your taste. A four-inch speaker delivers a full-bodied sound. Best of all, we've added an distortion switch to provide more sonic variation. Switch it on for a serious high-gain sound; switch it off for a bright, clean sound. Packed with Extras: In addition to the cool rhythms and great amp sound, the Jamming Pro Mini JAM provides numerous features indispensable to any guitar player. A dedicated E-string tuner keeps you in tune at all times. Use the headphone jack for private practice at any hour! Connect your MP3 player or other external audio source to the AUX IN jack and jam along with songs from your favorite band."
