        "Rokinon's 10mm F2.8 Ultra Wide Angle Lens is the newest addition to its highly regarded assortment of prime, fixed mount, wide angle lenses. Specifically designed for APS-C cameras, it utilizes a Nano Crystal Anti-Reflection Coating System, Aspherical Lens Elements and Extra Low Dispersion Glass to provide a high performance frame filling ultra-wide view equivalent to a 15mm lens (16mm for Canon APS-C DSLR’s) on a full frame camera. The 110 degree angle of view with its fast f/2.8 aperture provides the performance required by architectural and landscape photographers to capture dramatic perspectives while its extreme depth of field and 9.5” (.24m) close focus capability allow commercial photographers and journalists working in tight spaces to get that needed shot. For full frame cameras, see Rokinon's 14mm F2.8 lens."
