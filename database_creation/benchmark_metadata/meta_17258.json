    "description": [
        "Leavening the Jack London adventure staple with striking CGI animal effects, this engaging effort follows the odyssey of Buck, the sturdy mutt stolen from his home in 1890s California and shipped to the Yukon for service as a sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush. Rescued from an abusive owner by elderly prospector John Thornton (Harrison Ford), the two forge a bond that will be tried by unforgiving fate. Dan Stevens, Omar Sy, Karen Gillan, Bradley Whitford also star. 100 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: English."
