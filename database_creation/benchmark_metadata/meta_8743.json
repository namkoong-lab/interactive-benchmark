        "Grade 4 Up-A collection of poems by Native Americans in grades 2-12. Most of these selections were written in response to images of Native artifacts or historical photographs. The young writers' personal reactions and associations to these images leave readers with a strong sense of each one's experience as a modern Indian, and of the values that each holds dear. The book is a work of art in itself, with dozens of full-color and black-and-white photos from the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. The pages are also decorated with detailed border designs. Eight nations are represented, with brief descriptions of the character of each people. While the poems are suitable for younger children to hear aloud, the book is small and would not work with a large group. There are no other collections like this.",

        "Joy Harjo, Muskoke poet and musician Poems are peeled from the soul of this world we find ourselves in. The journey may be tough, almost unbearable, and it may be beautiful, almost unbearable -- but our songs, in whatever form, will ensure a path. There are some amazing young poets here.... This collection proves we are at \"the dawn of good luck,\" \"filled with Indian Power.\" It's true. You can hear it in these poems. --",
