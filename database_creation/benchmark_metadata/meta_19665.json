        "Classic Black & White",
        "Douglas Fairbanks returns as the swashbuckling D'artagnan, in this rollicking follow-up to the original Three Musketeers (1921). It seems the real King Louis XIV is a prisoner of his evil twin, who has also assumed his brother's identity. Held in a dark dungeon, the real King is further condemned to live out his days in an impenetrable iron mask designed to conceal his real identity. It is left to the heroic exploits of D'artagnan and his fellow musketeers to foil the plans of the malicious doppelganger and save the King in doing so.",
        "The Iron Mask",
        "is a true cinema classic remade a number of times, most recently in 1998, with Leonard DiCaprio in a starring role."
