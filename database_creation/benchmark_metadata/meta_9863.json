        "Revolutionary!  There is no other word for this Raspberry that is a quantum leap ahead of the competition.  Dwarf and rounded, this thornless beauty tops off at only 3' in height while producing a boatload of sweet tasting mid season red Raspberries in June and July. While it does spread like other Raspberries in the ground, it is perfectly suited for growing in a container on a deck so that you can pick delicious fruit at your leisure. Gone are the Raspberries that take over the landscape! Start a berry revolution in your garden today!"
