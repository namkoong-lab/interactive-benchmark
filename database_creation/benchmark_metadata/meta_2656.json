        "Gr. 4-6. In this entry in the Kaya Mystery series, the tribe is preparing for the winter Nez Perce Spirit Dances when an injured stranger arrives. The young woman's hands are badly burned, she sleepwalks, and she seems unable to speak. Despite misgivings, the tribe takes the woman in, and Kaya tries to befriend Hawk Woman, as she calls the stranger, even though the woman takes Kaya's dog, Tatlo, for her own. It's only after Kaya rescues Hawk Woman from a snowstorm that she finally learns the stranger's story. Shaw's narrative emphasizes tribal values (caring for the less fortunate, honoring the deceased) and the everyday life of the Nez Perce prior to European contact. There's not much drama beyond uncovering Hawk Woman's story, and the ending seems somewhat contrived, but readers who have enjoyed Kaya's previous mysteries will want to read this all the same.",

        "Each night when Janet Shaw was a girl, she took out a flashlight and book hidden under her pillow and read until she fell asleep. She and her brother liked to act out stories, especially ones about sword fights and wild horses. Today, Ms. Shaw has three grown children. When they were small, she often pulled them in a big red wagon to the library, where they filled the wagon with so many books, they had to walk back home. Ms. Shaw now lives in North Carolina with her husband and their dog.",
