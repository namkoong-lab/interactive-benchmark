        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Rune, the shrewd and spunky heroine of Manhattan Is My Beat , returns with a new job as a camerawoman for a local TV news station, but she still believes in magic and lives by her own rules. Rune thinks that Randy Boggs, convicted killer of network news head Lance Hopper, is innocent, and she persuades network dragon lady Piper Sutton, the country's top news anchor, to let her investigate and produce a segment on the murder. Endearing, with lots of moxie but no experience, Rune learns the hard way as she blunders through the world of big-time investigative reporting, making mistakes and trusting the wrong people. She also has to act as a mother to her flaky friend Claire's three-year-old, Ophelia, when Claire runs off to Boston in search of a better life. Deaver's background as a journalist helps him to vivify the competitive, even back-stabbing caste system of network news and to successfully depict the tedium as well as the excitement a reporter experiences when breaking a major story. He writes with clarity, compassion and intelligence, and with a decidedly human and contemporary slant. Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "From Library Journal",
        "After viewing a video of a convicted murderer, houseboat dwelling Rune ( Death of a Blue Movie Star , Bantam, 1990) decides the man is innocent; she then convinces her employer, Network News, to sponsor her investigation. Why Rune believes what she does remains inexplicable, which necessitates a great deal of persuasion on her (and the author's) part. Ultimately, Rune finds herself mixed up with the convict, her bosses, and a cute three-year-old. Despite its extended exposition, this tale of a news scoop gone wrong should appeal to fans.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "Rolling-stone punk naif Rune (veteran of two paperback mysteries) embarks on a crusade to free Randy Boggs, who's done three years in Attica for killing Lance Hopper, head of the news network for whose Manhattan affiliate she's been grinding a camcorder. Naturally, everybody from sympathetic producer Lee Maisel to cartoonishly nasty news-anchor Piper Sutton tries to get her off the story, but, untroubled by a scene-stealing baby she's just inherited, a thug named Jack Nestor who's stalking her, and the deaths of Boggs's protector in prison and a key witness whose testimony exonerates Boggs, she finally succeeds in getting him sprung--and then wishes she hadn't, as he doesn't look nearly so innocent out on the street. Peerless entertainment for those who like 'em gaudy, manic, and totally awesome. --",
