        "In his late-'70s hit-making heyday, Andy Gibb was largely dismissed as a teen pinup coasting on the coattails of his big brothers, the Bee Gees (who were then at the height of their Saturday Night Fever-era success). Indeed, hits like `I Just Want to Be Your Everything', `(Love Is) Thicker Than Water', `Shadow Dancing', `An Everlasting Love', and `(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away', all of which featured vocal, songwriting and/or production help from various Bee Gees. Universal."
