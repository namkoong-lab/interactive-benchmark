        "Fitments* Compatible with Nissan Frontier 2005-2008 All Model * Compatible with Nissan Frontier 2009-2021(Only Fit Model With Chrome Bumper Not Fit Pro-4X Model) * Compatible with Nissan Pathfinder 2005-2007IntroductionLooking for an easy way to customize your vehicle's look? A brand new stainless steel eGrille is the answer! This custom grille insert is easy to install and will upgrade your car or truck's appearance within minutes. Made from grade 304 stainless steel, the black eGrille stays painted and looking great much longer than aluminum grilles. The eGrille is the only grill that is powder coated black on all 4 sides, giving the eGrille 360 degree coverage. Attention to detail is another winning factor - meaning the eGrille is beautifully finished front and back. Heavy duty rivet bolts exert uniform clamping along the back of the eGrille, ensuring that not a whistle will be heard as you speed along the highway. A dreadful whistling noise is reportedly common in other brands of grilles. This is caused by poor welding techniques and the wind passing through the crevices. Choose the black eGrille for superior craftsmanship and a one of a kind look.Specification*Position: Lower Bumper*Material: 304 Stainless Steel*Finish: Black Powder CoatedInstallation1 pc Bolt Over/Overlay/Bolton (Drilling Not Required)Item offeredBillet Grille InsertAll Necessary Mounting HardwaresInstallation InstructionNoteGrille insert only, logo or emblem, frame or shell is NOT included."
