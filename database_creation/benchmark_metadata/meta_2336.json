Yet there was one area of her life that wasn't working: her love life. She'd been living with her boyfriend for five years, and although she was ready to get married, he wasn't. His reason? They fought too much-and unfortunately, he was right.

Influenced by a hardworking supermom, the author describes herself as \"opinionated, ambitious, and forceful\" and doesn\\'t think that women should be doormats, like she was during a previous relationship. She advises women to know when to cede control, and she provides a series of dance analogies and journaling suggestions, such as composing a \"gratitude list\" or thinking of good qualities in admirable women. Some exercises are fun; for example, the \"Shopping Cart Tango\" is a lighthearted dance/walk for channeling inner goddesses at the grocery store. A \"Lead/Follow\" exercise puts one partner behind a blindfold, following the body movements of the other. Even those with two left feet probably know most of what\\'s here--e.g., learn how to love yourself and actively listen. But Rose is gifted with a sharp and humorous pen. When a waiter accidentally brought her man spaghetti without meatballs, Rose was tempted to make him send the pasta back.
