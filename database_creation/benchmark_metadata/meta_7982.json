        "About the Author",
        "Vegan couple Roxy and Ben launched So Vegan just over two years ago with the mission to revolutionize the way we think about vegan food. Nothing like So Vegan existed at the time, so the couple decided to take a leap of faith: they devoted all their spare time to developing and filming plant-powered recipes from their cozy south London flat. Fast forward to today, their channel now has over one million devoted followers and their recipes reach a staggering tens of millions of people around the world every month."
