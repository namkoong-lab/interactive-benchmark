        "This book teaches the basics of XML with an original approach, using real-world examples from an interesting (and operating) environment with broad applicability. It covers the full spectrum of Berkeley DB XML tools, including the command-line shell, transactions, rollbacks, replication, archiving and monitoring. Techniques and concepts that have broad applicability outside of the subject matter are skillfully explained: XML, XPath, XQuery, XML schemas, all industry-standard technologies that find one of their best tutorial treatments, and all in the context of a simple database solution. The book also presents a remarkable example of query power."
