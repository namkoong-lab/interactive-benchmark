        "The only thing more frightening than driving down a deserted stretch of road in the middle of the night is realizing that you’re not alone. It’s 1996 and high school sweethearts, Zoe and Stefano, are enjoying a valentine’s night in when Zoe realizes she is about to miss her midnight curfew. Worried about losing her car privileges, she jumps into her Ford Escort and begins the long and dark drive home. Meanwhile, Stefano is caught off guard by a troubling psychic premonition of blood – lots of blood. As the clock ticks down to midnight, Zoe comes to the bone-chilling realization that she has a bigger problem than answering to her strict father about the time. Will Zoe and Stefano survive the night? If you like paranormal thrillers, don’t miss this fast paced short story. Comments from goodreads: \"Excellent short read with unexpected twists all the way through!\" \"A very fun and fast read\""
