        "1942. The second world war rages between the Axis and Allied Powers. Daniel, a skilled navigator in the German navy, has done everything asked of him for his country and is called upon one last time for a top-secret mission that leads him deep into enemy territory. His family is left in the dark regarding his whereabouts, and he’s left in the dark regarding the particulars of the mission. But should he succeed, he’ll finally have a chance to see them again. But tragedy soon finds him. Aboard a ship with no communication gear, his fate nearly sealed when he and his commanding officer, Colonel Ziegler are taken prisoner and kept at the behest of their captors, chances of Daniel seeing his family again are all but gone. With their hands tied in the custody of the enemy and without a means of contacting German high command, Daniel and Ziegler must find a way to preserve the secrecy of their mission without compromising their own lives. However, as pressure mounts around them and the stakes rise, a deep web of secrets begins to unravel and the harsh reality of the German’s mission threatens to reshape the world as they know it."
