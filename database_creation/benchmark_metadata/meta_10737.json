        "DHA is one of the most important omega-3 fatty acids and plays a vital role in every aspect of your health. That's why we offer this high-potency, 1,000mg DHA plus 75mg DPA formula in a convenient once-daily softgel to support eye, brain and heart health.† Our fully traceable and sustainably-sourced anchovy is Non-GMO Project Verified and formulated with specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM), which are compounds that naturally support normal inflammatory responses in the body.† Garden of Life offers fish oil and other dietary supplements that contain omega fatty acids. Omega fatty acids support the structure and function of the brain and other cells in the body. These sustainably sourced supplements deliver various combinations of omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid). As essential building blocks of cellular membranes, EPA and DHA play critical roles in maintaining brain and body health. EPA plays a role in supporting a healthy inflammatory response at the cellular level, while DHA is the most abundant omega-3 found in the brain and is important for maintaining brain and nerve cell structure and function. Additionally, DHA and EPA promote healthy blood flow, which is essential to optimal brain function, memory retention and overall health. †These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
