        "Hollie Newton is a self-taught gardener. She is also one of Europe's youngest Executive Creative Directors and one of the very few women in the world to hold this position. She has produced award winning work for everyone from the BBC and Volvo Cars, to Prada, the Roald Dahl Literary Estate, and Lurpak.Hollie started growing vegetables and fruit on her tiny rented balcony in an attempt to escape from the pressure of her job, reclaiming a slice of the natural world in which she feels happiest. What started as \"a few hanging tomatoes\" rapidly became a borderline obsession. On finally purchasing a forlorn wasteland of a back garden, Hollie started recording the process of transforming it into an Eden-like sanctuary, sharing her mistakes and triumphs as she went. Proving unexpectedly popular with friends, the idea for the book was born."
