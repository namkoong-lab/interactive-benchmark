        "In the heart of the singing desert, the people are fading from the world. Mothers bear few live children, the warriors and wardens are hard-pressed to protect those who remain, and the vash’ai—the great cats who have called the people",

        "for as long as there have been stories—bond with fewer humans each year. High above, the Sun Dragon sings a song of life and love while far below, the Earth Dragon slumbers as she has since the beginning of time. Her sleep is fitful, and from the darkness of her dreams come whispers of war . . . and death.   Sulema is a newly minted warrior of the people and a true Ja’Akari—a daughter of the unforgiving desert. When a mysterious young man appears in her home of Aish Kalumm, she learns that the Dragon King is dying in distant Atualon. As the king fades, so does the magic that sings the Earth Dragon to sleep. There are those who wish to keep the dragon trapped in endless slumber. Others would tap her power to claim it for their own. And there are those who would have her wake, so they might laugh as the world burns."

        "Praise for the DRAGON'S LEGACY Saga",
        "\"You have to surrender to the domination of the author, and trust that she isn’t just freewheeling. Otherwise you lose that precious sense of depth, which J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling and George R.R. Martin were all able to sustain over multiple books... Ms. Wolf [is] off to a good start.”—",
