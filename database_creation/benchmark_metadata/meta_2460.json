        "Today, many believe the Civil War was fought over slavery. This view satisfies our contemporary sense of justice, but as Gallagher's searing revisionist history shows, it is an anachronistic judgment. Northern citizen-soldiers fought the war to preserve the Union. Emancipation was secondary to the war’s primary goal of safeguarding the republic."

        "Review",
        "\"The Union War",
        "reaffirms Gary Gallagher's reputation as one of the most astute and provocative writers on the American Civil War. This work places the Union at the heart of the war but also argues for the central role of armies and soldiers in understanding how the goals of reunion and emancipation were finally realized. With clarity and verve, Gallagher deals with large questions in an unfailingly profound way.\"",
        "-- \"George C. Rable, author of God's Almost Chosen Peoples\"",
        "\"A rare volume that forces us to reconsider how we think about the Civil War. Examining historic actors in the context of their own time and place, Gallagher reminds of the centrality of 'Union' as the motivating force driving the Northern cause, and the significance of those citizen-soldiers who joined the Union Army in determining the results.\"",
        "-- \"Matthew Gallman, author of Northerners at War: Reflections on the Civil War Home Front\"",
        "\"Gallagher, one of the nation's preeminent Civil War scholars and a professor at the University of Virginia, deals in his latest book of the question of why did the North fight? His answer is in the volume's first sentence: The loyal American citizenry fought a war for Union that also killed slavery. This fast-paced review of the controversies that civil war historians have been arguing about is opinionated, well-informed, provocative and just the thing any American history buff needs to read this spring as our country gears up for the sesquicentennial of the conflict that made the United States begin to live up to the Declaration's words that 'all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'\"",
        "-- \"Karl Rove\"",
        "\"Gary Gallagher has written another gem in",
        "The Union War",
        ". A companion to his brilliant and controversial The Confederate War, this slender volume is sure to generate wide readership and debate.\"",
        "-- \"Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of General Lee's Army: From Victory to Defeat\"",
        "\"Gary Gallagher, more carefully and precisely than anyone else, enables the reader to understand why so many citizen soldiers were willing to peril their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to preserve the United States as one nation, indivisible and, in Lincoln's words at Gettysburg, to give the 'new nation' brought forth in 1776 a 'new birth of freedom' in 1863.\"",
        "-- \"James M. McPherson, author of Battle Cry of Freedom\"Brimming with insights, eloquent in argument, and filled with new evidence from the men who fought for the Union, this revisionist history will cause readers to rethink many of the now-standard Civil War interpretations. An essential work.-- \"Library Journal Starred Review\"",
