        "* R12 to R134a hose * Automotive air conditioning refrigerant replenishing pipe adapter 8 piece set * Auto refrigerant fitting ac repair tool multifunction swivel adapter kit * Multi-functional automotive air conditioning refrigerant conversion joints, fluoride joints, fluoride tools, table fittings, one-time to meet your car needs! Blue hose adapter 1/4\" M to 7/16\" SAE F, with valve core and swivel. Used for R12 low side port. Red hose adapter 1/4\" M to 3/8\" SAE F, with valve core but no swivel. Used for R12 hi side port. (On this one the seal inside mine looks a little deformed.) 90 deg adapter 1/4\" M to 7/16\" SAE F. With valve depressor. R12 low. 90 deg adapter 1/4\" M to 3/8\" SAE F. With valve depressor. R12 hi. Some older vehicles had the same fittings on both low & hi sides, so it's useful to have two adapters. 90 deg adapter 1/4\" M to 1/4\" F. With valve depressor. The 90 deg ones are good for accessing ports where there is not a lot of clearance. Straight adapter 1/4\" M to 1/8\" NPT M. With valve core. Could possibly be used on a gauge manifold. Straight adapter 1/4\" M to metric 9x1mm M. With valve core. No idea what this is used for. Big adapter. 1/4 Male fitting is fine, female fitting is too small for 1/2\" ACME, seems loose on 1/4\" flare. Has valve depressor.",
