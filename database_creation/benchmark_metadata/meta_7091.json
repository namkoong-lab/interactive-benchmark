Carolyn Hemming and Patricia Green are the sisters known for helping to start the quinoa craze in North America with the bestselling book Quinoa 365: The Everyday Superfood. BUT we do a whole lot more than just quinoa!', 'We spend our time searching for the best ways to maximize nutrition, increase energy, and to improve overall health and physical fitness.', \"Searching for the best ways to maximize nutrition, increase energy, and to improve overall health and physical fitness is what led Patricia Green and Carolyn Hemming to write cookbooks. Having everything healthy and home made as children, from bread to cookies and yogurt, and the occasional store-bought seaweed chips, their mother taught them strictly to live by the 'food is medicine' principle. Today, Carolyn and Patricia are busy balancing family, career and fitness goals. Both avidly explore the use of superfoods and new meal ideas.\", 'Passion is everything! We believe that you have to love what you do. We also believe that you have to be aware of and connected to where your foods are coming from. Patricia travelled to Bolivia in 2011 to meet quinoa growing families first hand. She visited the working families, quinoa processing operations and the growing fields.', 'The sisters constantly seek healthy foods and recipes that can provide the right amount of energy, nutrition and portability.', \"Green & Hemming's recipes have been featured in numerous newspapers, magazines, popular food blogs and on radio and television.\"]}"
