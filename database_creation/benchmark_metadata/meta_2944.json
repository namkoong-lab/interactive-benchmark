        "Diagnosed when he was not even a year old, Bob Mutchler understands firsthand how life-altering polio can be. Yet he and his family refused to let the challenges of this debilitating disease affect his future. As an adult Bob combined his membership in Rotary International and his love of motorcycle riding to help with The Rotary Foundation’s commitment to provide polio immunization to children everywhere through a program called PolioPlus. This is the gripping story of a man who knows from his own experiences exactly what a “world without polio” can mean to children and families. Crisscrossing Australia and North America on his motorcycle, “Motorcycle Bob” shares his own personal struggles as he tirelessly dedicates himself to the eradication of polio worldwide. All proceeds from the sale of this book are being donated to The Rotary Foundation's PolioPlus program."

She spent over thirty years as a Marriage and Family Therapist, and is currently a Mental Skills Coach for Athletes with a special interest in equestrians, endurance athletes, and golfers. She writes the 'Ask Lynda' column for WomenADVriders.com.\", 'Two-Up, her first book, recounts her first three years together with Terry, a second marriage for both of them. Lynda moves from novice to experienced passenger as they build their relationship while simultaneously learning to ride together as a team in the world of long distance motorcycling. Her unique perspective as both a therapist and competitor adds a new dimension to motorcycling literature. Lynda\\'s column, \"Perspective,\" appeared in the Iron Butt Magazine, a publication dedicated to the sport of safe long distance riding.', \"In her second book, From Iron Lung to Iron Butt: Riding Polio Into History, she tells the story of Bob, who contracted polio as an infant and has lived with the effects. A long distance rider, he has made it his life's mission to help eradicate the disease worldwide. As a result of her research for the book, Lynda joined both Rotary International and Bob's efforts to raise awareness of this campaign.\", \"The Winner's Mind comes out of her work with athletes as well as her training as a therapist and mental skills coach. The exercises in the book come in handy as she continues to compete in various endurance events. It is also available in French through the publisher, De Boeck Supérieur.\", \"The Women's Guide to Motorcycling is the book she wished she had when first introduced to riding, and is filled with knowledge gleamed from her own experiences as well as the collected wisdom of women riders everywhere.\", \"Switching gears, her latest book, The Story, delves into the discovery of, and fallout from, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in a family member. Based on her knowledge as a therapist combined with personal family experiences dealing with this disease, she has created a fictional memoir style story that many will relate to.\", 'Lynda resides in Snoqualmie, Washington with her husband, Terry, where she now rides, and competes, on her own bike alongside him rather than as pillion.']}"
