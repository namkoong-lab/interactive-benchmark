        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreS-Gr 2—This cute adventure story may be music to listeners' ears. A blue baboon locates an unused instrument and begins playing her own melody. Although interrupted by a rainstorm, the baboon strives to keep the music playing in a new land. The rhymes are so succinct they seem to have written themselves; \"Orange moon, blue baboon./ Blue baboon/ spies bassoon.\" The baboon meets another friend, and they discover a way to share their musical talents together. The rhymes are perfectly written to convey movement from action to action; the purposeful vocabulary and delightful color enrich children's knowledge while capturing and keeping their attention. The matching font color to the objects strikes a high note as well. The heart balloon travels throughout, moving from the cat at the beginning of the story to another baboon at the end; it is a dazzling idea and may be a creative tool for a follow-up activity. What may this love represent? VERDICT Although considered a bedtime story, this lovely journey may be read anytime as it broadens vocabulary, expresses a love of music and learning, and demonstrates togetherness in social gatherings. Patrons will sing your praises.—Tanya Haynes",
