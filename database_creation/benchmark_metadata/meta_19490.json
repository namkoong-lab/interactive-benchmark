        "Product Description",
        "The King of disco. The man with a secret life. The rising star eager to get ahead. The music producer desperate for one more hit. In Montreal in 1976, they all wanted to see and be seen at the trendiest club in town, and juggled freedom and tradition, lovers and family, drugs and sobriety, fame and anonymity, in a time when excess was the norm, and disco ruled. Based on true events, Funkytown brings back the glitter, glamour and edginess of that era.",

        "About the Director",
        "With degrees in film from Concordia University and the University of Southern California, Daniel Roby first worked as director of photography on several shorts and as cameraman on Michel Jetté s feature film Hochelaga (2000). He then served as line producer on Robin Aubert s Lila, which won the award for Best Medium-Length Fiction Film from the Association des critiques de cinéma du Québec in 2001. In 2000, he launched the Zone Films production company and produced a series of four shorts, including Nos bras meurtris vous tendent le flambeau, the first Canadian drama filmed entirely in high definition and projected in 35mm. In 2001, he was director of photography for the feature film Trick or Treat and also directed his first short drama, Quelques instants de la vie d une fraise. In 2003, he produced and directed the feature film La Peau blanche, based on the novel by Joël Champetier, and was director of photography for the very popular TV series Hommes en 40taine. In 2004, La Peau blanche opened in Quebec theatres to a warm reception by the critics. The film was sold in a dozen countries and screened at over 25 festivals around the world, including the Toronto International Film Festival, where it won Best Canadian First Feature Film. TIFF then chose it as one of the top ten Canadian films of the year, and the MOMA, in New York City, included it in its list of the best Canadian films of 2004. In 2005, Daniel Roby s directing talent was once again rewarded when La Peau blanche earned him the prestigious Claude Jutra award at the Genies. His next feature film, Funkytown, opens soon.",
