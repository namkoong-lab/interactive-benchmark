        "Most Christians know they should be trying to tell their friends and family about Jesus. But in a post-Christendom world, personal evangelism is viewed negatively--it's offensive, inappropriate, and insensitive. Recent studies confirm that the majority of Christians rarely evangelize, worried they might offend their family or lose their friends. In",

        ", author Sam Chan equips everyday Christians who are reluctant and nervous to tell their friends about Jesus with practical, tested ways of sharing their faith in the least awkward ways possible.",
        "Drawing from over two decades of experience as an evangelist, teacher, and pastor, Chan explains why personal evangelism feels so awkward today. And utilizing recent insights from communication theory, cross-cultural ministry, and apologetics, he helps you build confidence in sharing your faith, and teaches you how to evangelize your friends and family in socially appropriate ways."

        "'Sam has cut his teeth sharing the gospel in the context of diverse, urban, post-Christian Australia. His infectious enthusiasm for evangelism shines through in this practical and inspiring guide. A fantastic resource for communicating the life-changing message of Jesus to a world hungry for meaning.' --",
        "MARK SAYERS, author of Reappearing Church, cohost of This Cultural Moment podcast, and senior leader of Red Church",
        "'This is a delightful book and perfect for anyone who thinks evangelism is beyond their pay grade! Sam Chan motivates and equips all believers--regardless of gifting or temperament--in how to reach the hard-to-reach in today's challenging post-Christian culture. His eight tips are illuminating, thoughtful yet practical, culturally relevant, biblically faithful, and relationally effective. I loved the book, and I think you will too!' --",
        "REBECCA MANLEY PIPPERT, author of Stay Salt: The World Has Changed: Our Message Must Not",
        "'When I wasn't a Christian, I was sometimes approached by 'that guy' who eagerly but awkwardly talked to me about Jesus. Thankfully, I ran into people who knew how not to be 'that guy.' Also thankfully, Sam Chan helps all of us to not be 'that guy' so we can point people to the person of Jesus. Sam has taken a heavy topic and made it into a breezy read that will inform, amuse, and inspire.' --",
        "ABDU MURRAY, author and speaker, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries",
        "'Sam Chan is a breath of fresh air. His book is inspiring and practical. Challenging and kind. Timely and timeless. Strategic and genuine. He lives what he writes, yet his life and vision for effective evangelism are accessible to us all. Thank you, Sam, for this incredible gift in How to Talk about Jesus (Without Being That Guy)!' --",
        "CRAIG SPRINGER, executive director, Alpha USA, and author of How to Follow Jesus and How to Revive Evangelism",
        "'Practical, readable, and Spirit-infused! Sam Chan has given believers a pathway to sharing faith that is organic and accessible to ordinary people. Read it, put it into action, and watch God use you to share his love and grace in fresh new ways.' --",
        "KEVIN HARNEY, founder of Organic Outreach International and author of the Organic Outreach trilogy",
        "'Reading Sam Chan's How to Talk about Jesus (Without Being That Guy) was a bit like doing a jigsaw puzzle--you have all the pieces, but you're not sure how they fit together. In terms of evangelism, I knew that things like theology, story, culture, history, and community were essential, but I hadn't grasped how they fit together until Sam gave me the code. The church owes Sam a huge debt of thanks for this excellent resource, which will help us model faithful, sustainable evangelism ourselves and also train our beloved church families to speak about Jesus.' --",
        "RICO TICE, senior minister for evangelism at All Souls Church, Langham Place, and author of Honest Evangelism",
        "'In his new book, expert evangelist Sam Chan invites you into his home to see what personal evangelism looks like in his own life, complete with examples, stories, and other practical guidance. It is a great resource for every Christian who wants to help others meet Jesus.' --",
        "CRAIG ELLIS, founder and CEO, The Elpis Network",
        "'Inspirational and immensely practical, Sam Chan shows us what a life of witness actually looks like--and it looks radiant! The book shines with gospel optimism and everyday wisdom. This is not about 'silver bullets' (there are none!); instead Sam shows us the community, the posture, the lifestyle, and the beating heart of a witness for Jesus, earthing it in our ordinary lives of discipleship. If you're stuck thinking, I should evangelize, let Sam raise your gaze. This book shows us we are all witnesses, and, wonderfully, each of us can play our part.' --",
        "GLEN SCRIVENER, director of Speak Life and author of The Gift and 3 2 1: The Story of God, the World and You",
        "'The Jesus of the Bible is at work today, and finding out where he is already 'unsettling' our own contacts is the most thrilling, joyful, Spirit-filled experience. What a master class from Sam 'Mr. Motivator' Chan in how to get cracking. I couldn't put this book down. Thanks to Sam's engaging and oh so practical advice, many will be encouraged enough to start discovering that the power is in the Word, but--and it's a big but--we do have to get out to share it! When doing so, I am consistently asked, 'Why has no one ever shown me this before?'' --",
