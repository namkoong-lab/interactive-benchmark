        "Through its global approach, Sowers and Rowe's book encourages students to think critically about oppression and social justice issues at home and around the world. As a fundamental premise, the book establishes that social work practice needs to move from the local to the global in order for social justice to prevail. By shifting toward the broader study of institutional oppression and social justice advocacy, the authors also address the CSWE requirement to provide global content in the undergraduate and graduate curriculums. Throughout the text, articles, quotes and examples powerfully illustrate the key issues."

        "Review",
        "\"I see this as a most important book for the field. These two authors are to be commended. In a very cogent way they argue, with rich supporting data, that to understand any area of social work practice in this era of globalization it must be viewed from an inter-influencing international perspective...In an important way, this work serves to further link the profession as an international force in the quest for universal social justice.\"\"...I�ve already told several of my colleagues about this text and about the global/international perspective and how it all gets tied to create a better understanding of not only our social problem and social policies, but how every problem and social issue is interconnected. The point that social work needs and must make these connections is another strength of this text....Please send me a copy!!!\"",
