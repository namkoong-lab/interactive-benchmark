        "Financial setbacks and development problems with its Rolls Royce RB211 engines meant that it lost out to the rival DC 10 in commercial sales, but the TriStar was a technologically advanced aircraft that remains an aviation icon. This new Just Flight L 1011 TriStar collection pays homage to this much loved tri jet with four superbly modelled airliner and military variants in a total of 25 paint schemes. The aircraft feature accurately detailed 2D panels and virtual cockpits complete with refuelling controls on the tanker variants, a fully functioning Inertial Navigation System, stunning high resolution textures and an authentic flight model with the TriStar's unique Direct Lift Control runway approach system."
