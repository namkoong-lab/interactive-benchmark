        "Wire strippers are a standard tool for any wire installation project. Gardner Bender has a full line of wire stripping tools that feature the standard functionality that every wire stripper must have, as well as additional features, including built-in bolt cutters, crimpers, and pliers' noses. Each wire stripper has different characteristics that provide various different benefits for the user. Some have a looping hole that aids in wire pulling and termination, a high precision joint to ensure smooth operation, some have the ability to strip copper and aluminum in both solid and stranded wire, cut and rethread bolts, or have built in crimp stations for insulated and non-insulated terminals. Some beneficial characteristics that come standard with each tool includes nick-resistant, stainless steel blades, precision ground cutting edges, contoured grip handles for ease of use, and an anti-glare black oxidation blade surface treatment for better vision. With a wide array of outstanding features, this is an essential wire stripper for every toolbox. Forward thinking design concepts ensure product usefulness for generations to come.",
