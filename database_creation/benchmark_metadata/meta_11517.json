        "Powerful 16x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens",
        "The PowerShot SX160 IS features a powerful Genuine Canon 16x Optical Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. With precision engineering and decades of leadership in optical technologies, Canon has created a bright, wide-angle lens that provides an extraordinary 16x zoom range. The lens starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 448mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), giving you tremendous coverage and reach. The telephoto end lets you capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. Moreover, this superb lens incorporates innovative designs that enable it to fit the compact profile of the PowerShot SX160 IS.",
        "Optical Image Stabilizer",
        "Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For still photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.",
        "Powerful Core Specs Deliver Beautiful Images",
        "16.0 Megapixel Image Sensor",
        "The PowerShot SX160 IS's 16.0 Megapixel CCD sensor delivers impressive photos with fine detail and brilliant color. The high resolution ensures superb image quality even when cropping or making very large prints.",
        "Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor",
        "Canon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC Image Processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. New, more powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture.",
