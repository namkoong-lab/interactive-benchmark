        "The flaming chalice is the symbol of Unitarian Universalism. Where did the symbol originate? Why did Unitarian Universalists adopt it as the emblem of their faith? A Cup of Light looks at the separate symbols of fire and cup, and at their significance when combined as the flaming chalice. Written for young children, the simple, direct language helps bring meaning to this rich symbol."
