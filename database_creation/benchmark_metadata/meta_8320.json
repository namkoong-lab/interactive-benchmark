        "Review",
        "\"This book is very welcome as it provides a practical approach to project management as a part of change management. Some management textbooks on project management are often very theoretical and it is difficult for the information professional to draw practical lessons from them, but Barbara Allan has managed to overcome this by producing a thorough and practical management tool, written by an experienced and obviously successful professional. It is essential reading for anyone working in the profession who will be involved in change at some stage in their working life - and that is basically every library and information service manager.\" --New Library World",
