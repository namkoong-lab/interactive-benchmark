        "Barnaby Furnas",
        "radiate with frenetic energy and turbulence, while exploring archetypal themes of love, death, and war.These powerful images, which have been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, flirt with the boundaries of abstraction and figuration, while challenging the conventions and limits of expressionist painting. From the apocalyptic violence of epic battlefield scenes to the driving ecstasy of rock concerts, Furnas's paintings are dramatic spectacles of line, color, and movement."
