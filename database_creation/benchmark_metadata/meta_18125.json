        "New to the GTS line, and exclusively available on the Expedition, our revolutionary bungee pouch takes kayak seat storage to a new level. Specially designed to follow the sleek contours of the GTS Expedition, this colorful pouch is made from durable, flexible mesh, allowing the paddler to safely secure a variety of objects. Closing the pouch is a cinch with our latticed bungee zip cord. Cross threaded among eight heavy-duty nylon loops, this fastening system expands and contracts, conforming to the particular contents of the pouch at any given time. In the unlikely event that your kayak capsizes, you can rest assured that your gear will remain safely stowed. As with all the seats in the GTS line, the Expedition features our triangulated rear strapping system for customizable comfort you won’t find anywhere else. We have virtually eliminated that annoying \"kayak seat slippage\" with this 6 point rear attachment design. With this versatile and infinitely adjustable rear lock down system the paddler pulls the rear of the kayak seat from two adjustable upper points which determine the lean, and two adjustable lower points which combat any forward slippage. This method of counterbalancing the pull points secures the seat back to the boat and provides an extremely supportive and comfortable back plane. This particular GTS Expedition comes with our GTS Water Bottle Pack. The dual water bottle pack attaches securely via two plastic, side-squeeze buckles, and rests neatly atop the built-in bungee pouch. The GTS Water Bottle Pack features a generously sized zipper pack and two molded plastic water bottle holders. The included Surf To Summit water bottles hold 16 oz. of fluid each making this pack ultimate in on the water hydration. As with all of our GTS series seats, the paddler can trade out any of the interchangeable GTS packs."
