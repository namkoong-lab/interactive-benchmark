        "At 1½ pounds,",
        "Cadet Horseshoes",
        "are a full pound lighter than most other steel horseshoes. They are the lightest regulation horseshoe being manufactured in the entire world today! The Cadet is designed with the needs of the younger \"junior\" horseshoe pitchers in mind, but is also great for adults looking for an alternative to common heavier horseshoes. Parents and Grandparents choose the Cadet to introduce their kids and grandkids to the time-honored game of Horseshoes. The shape and feel of the Cadet resembles the ever-popular full weight Gordon Horseshoe and, like it, is conducive for pitching any style; turn or flip. The Medium Temper is soft enough to resist bounce back, yet hard enough to limit excess dings and burrs. The opening is the full 3½ inches, allowing for the greatest opportunity for success in making ringers.",
        "The Drop Forge Difference",
        "The Gold Standard in horseshoe manufacturing is the Drop Forge. It is only through this technology that the Ultra Light Weight Cadet Horseshoe can successfully be created. Forging produces a unique internal grain structure that endows exceptional strength and durability to the Cadet's high-grade carbon steel alloy. A horseshoe of this size made by the less expensive and more commonplace method of casting or lower quality steel would result in a high rate of breakage. The Cadet is an all-round horseshoe, equally fit for family reunions as it is for championship tournaments. When you pitch with the Cadet, you pitch with the best!"
