        "With wry humor, deep cultural insight, and an impressive capacity for malt liquor and black pepper potato chips, Ken Seeroi takes you through real-life tales of women in short skirts, men with no teeth, a friend's suicide, a fight with a yakuza, and a maze of smokey back-alley bars throughout Japan. This raucous, first-hand account is unvarnished Japan seen from the inside, detailed in fifty-eight astonishing stories. Inside: What to do after you get arrested; Dating versus having sex in Japan; How to get a job in Japan (and when to walk away); Renting an apartment as a \"foreigner\"; How to secure a visa, then not get deported; Why Japan's safe, but not that safe; How to survive a massive earthquake; When to use Japanese, and when not to; Why you want a very small Japanese motorcycle; and The one thing you must never do in Japan."

        "Review",
        "Hilarious and one of the most insightful perspectives on Japan that I know of.",

        "About the Author",
        "One afternoon, Ken Seeroi left his successful banking career and boarded a plane for Tokyo with two suitcases and a phrasebook. He spent a decade learning the language and living a Japanese lifestyle among local people, finally realizing his dream of a life in Japan. That was a terrible idea and you shouldn't do it. Ken Seeroi has now lived in Japan for 12 years, in seven different cities while pursuing a wide variety of jobs and women. He is well-renowned in the nation as an educator, karaoke singer, and for being white. Ken Seeroi is a U.S. born writer, photographer, and university lecturer. He once journeyed 3,000 miles across America on a mountain bike, with only a sleeping bag, tiny tent, and terrible hangover. He has published newspaper and magazine articles in Japan and the U.S., in both Japanese and English."
