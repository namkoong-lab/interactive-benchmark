        "It’s Christmas in the Big Apple. While the city is adorned with decorations and festive lights, something much more sinister is lurking in the shadows.It has been nearly a year since James Maguire and Rich Stargold took the reins of the New York City Police Department. During that time they have had to deal with a series of events, including racial discord and the threat of terrorism, which threatened to tear apart the very heart of the city. Now, as the year comes to a close, they are both ready to end it on a high note, but just as James proposes to Melody, the joyous moment is shattered when someone targets a high ranking member of the NYPD. Now it is up to the two men to figure out who the killer is before they strike again."
