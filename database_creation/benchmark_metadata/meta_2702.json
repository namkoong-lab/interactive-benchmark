        "From the Inside Flap",
        "Kashmira woke to a burning sensation in the back of her throat. Smelling smoke, she bolted upright, tore off her blanket, and rushed into her father's room. She shook him awake and they rushed downstairs.",
        "\"Kashmira! Douse the flames! Hurry,\" wheezed Baba, pressing the hem of his sleeve to his mouth.",
        "Her own lungs burning, Kashmira filled a cooking pot with water from a clay urn, flinging the contents as hard as she could at the furniture blocking their path. The liquid steamed themoment it touched the orange fingers of heat.",
        "\"It's no use, we have to find\"—cough cough—\"a different way,\" Baba gasped. His mustache, covered by a dusty film of ash, quivered as he spoke. \"Come on, this way.\"",
        "Crawling low to the ground, Kashmira followed closely as Baba led her to the storeroom with its lone window. Panic engulfed her as she glanced at the flames licking up the carpets. An ear-splitting crack came from above. Looking up, they watched the main beam snap down the middle as the surrounding support beams transformed into ash.",
        "\"There's not much time. We go NOW,\" wheezed Baba, shoving Kashmira into the storeroom. The fire danced too close for her comfort. Wild and dizzy, she crawled to the window,trying her best to ignore the singed smell of her shoes.",
        "\"Don't look back. I'm right behind you,\" she heard a barely audible whisper. Only pure adrenaline could have forced her through the inferno and out the window. Tumbling onto the ground, Kashmira sucked in the air, cleaner, although the noxious fumes of charred wood still hung around her. When he was out, Baba sucked in a long heaving breath. Kashmira looked back at the burning coffeehouse just in time to see the roof cave in, smashing the silver and copper pots.",
        "The fire consumed the carpets and tapestries Baba had picked out with loving care. It destroyed the rugs and pillows where many guests had sat. As the building went down, Kashmira snatched Baba by the hand. They escaped the hot rush of air that billowed out from the wreck. Further up the street, the clamor of soldiers and the shrieks of victims echoed. Soldiers headed their way on horseback, shooting fire-tipped arrows left and right through windows and doors. More people emptied into the streets. Kashmira half-dragged and half-towed Baba behind her as they joined the running crowd, not knowing where she was going. She emerged from the alley into the city center. The invaders' horses plowed through piles of spices, sending metal pots and plates rolling everywhere. Chickens beat their wingsand squawked at the top of their lungs as they escaped the fray.",
        "Kashmira backed into her still coughing father. \"Back. Turn back!\" But it was too late.The little alley was filling up with smoke and soldiers.",
        "Running as fast as her legs could carry her, and making sure her father was following, Kashmira pelted toward the opposite side of the square, but halfway there, a sudden weightnearly dragged her to the ground. Kashmira whirled around and screamed. Baba collapsed against her, his tunic drenched in blood. Standing over him was one of the invaders, his sword dripping and raised high for the next kill. Her.",
        "\"No! Baba!\" she screamed. The invader may as well have rammed his sword through her heart. With a last mournful glance, Baba's eyes clouded and he tumbled to the earth. Kashmira let go and raced the rest of the way across the square, darting through the archway of the nearest building. She found herself in a secluded garden. Green vines and flowers weaved thickly through the screen above. Somewhere hidden, a fountain burbled.",
        "She folded herself into some nearby bushes. \"Come out!\" Her heart stopped. She recognized the bark of the same invader who slayed her father. \"I saw you come in here!\"She peeked between the branches. Armor across his chest. Sword hanging at his side.Kashmira shivered as she listened to him mutter to himself under his breath, \"Just thirty more points. That's all I need. On to the next mission.\"",
        "Wait a minute. Isn't he? No, he is a different man. But his clothes. Swinging his blade left and right, he chopped through the leaves and twigs, interrupting her thoughts. Kashmira coweredand crawled on, narrowly dodging his deranged swipes. The burbling of the fountain grew louder, and she was running out of space to crawl. \"Gotcha!\" cried the man as he stabbed clumsily.",
        "Pain inundated her senses as she rolled out from cover. She clutched her side, blood streaming from her body, gurgling through her fingers. As swiftly as he had come, her attacker was gone. He rejoined the invasion outside. Gasping for breath, Kashmira shivered from the sudden chill. She made her way to the fountain, sliding painfully along the ground. A row of round stones formed the lip of the pool, catching the cascade where it fell. Leaning against the cool stone, Kashmira pressed her gushing gash. As she slumped there, her vision swam.",
        "Soon, the world around her dimmed and disappeared until only her own breath could be heard, growing thinner and more ragged. This is it, she thought to herself. No more. Her world faded to blackness...",
