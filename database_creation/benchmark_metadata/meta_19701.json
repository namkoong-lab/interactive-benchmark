        "Hilary Duff, Heather Locklear and Chris Noth star in this hilarious yet heartwarming comedy about mothers, daughters and the outrageous lengths people will go to for love. Holly Hamilton (Duff) is on a mission to find her single mom (Locklear) a perfect man….Even if she has to make that man up! Without other options, she creates an imaginary secret admirer based on a charming restaurateur (Noth). But this scheme keeps Holly on her toes more than it actually sweeps her mother off her feet. One crazy mishap after another leads the two of them to discover that sometimes what you're looking for is already right in front of you.",
