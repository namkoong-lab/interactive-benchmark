        "From the Author",
        "I was around ten years old when I had my first supernatural experience. I've seen full-bodied apparitions, felt a dark presence practically breathing down my neck, and experienced a ghost (or something) that seemed more curious than anything. As a horror/supernatural/mystery/thriller writer, I just had to put together a collection like this. Do I believe in ghosts? Read this 3-book collection and find out for yourself! ~ Jeff Bennington"
