        "Well, it’s official. I’m a legendary divine being with mysterious origins who needs my chosen Champions to boost my powers through supernatural sexcapades. I would care what my parents thought—if only I could find out who they were.To unearth my ancestry, I need to locate the long-lost access point to the original Garden of Eden. All while allowing a tenacious human reporter to create a camera-ready version of me as the savior of all mankind.But first, I need to rescue one Champion from Heaven, convince another to stop playing hard-to-get, and decide how I feel about a dangerous ancient being who intends to create a world-ending Antichrist baby with me.Take it easy, boys—there’s plenty of me to go around.The suspicious motives of Heaven, and the discovery that an old acquaintance in Hell may secretly have my back, have made me question whom I can really trust...including within my own team.And when it comes to the fine line I’m already walking between darkness and light, I may not even be able to trust myself.—The Wings of Darkness + Light trilogy is an alternate history that imagines \"What if angels and demons walked among us?\"",

        "Review",
        "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐A Demon, a Scientist, and a Goddess walk into Heaven...This intelligently written, awe-inspiring, installment of the Wings of Darkness and Light series by C Rochelle is un-put-down-able!I love Syd's strength and her champion's desire to keep her safe. The interplay of each individual relationship builds the solidity of the whole group and together they are far stronger than alone. It is fantastic to see a once insecure character come into her own in this book, taking no crap from anyone and asserting her right to defend herself, yet not diminishing her companions' strengths in any way.This story made me gasp, laugh out loud in public, cry, and say damned unkind things about the author! How could she? Grrrr...  The writing is passionate, descriptive, but not overly so, with a beautifully executed final chapter that leaves you begging for book 3 to be in your hands immediately if not sooner.Make sure you read book 1 - Shadows Spark to gain the full picture and characters in this story.",
        "-Cat Martindale-Vale, Red Ink and Coffee (advanced copy reader)",
        "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐This installment of Syd and her champions was on fire. What a perfect blend of slow-burn anticipation and all of the sexy stuff you hope for.This is the second book in the series, and the way each of the characters evolved was so amazing to watch. Watch out, there's a certain demon that will steal your heart. A sexy adventure about trust, growth, and self-discovery.",
