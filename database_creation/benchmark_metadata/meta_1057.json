    "description": [
        "The slightly longer curved ergonomic handle provides a comfortable grip and features 7 signature black dots which represent the 7 Samurai codes of honor and moral principles.  The beautiful hammered finish applied to the patented Cordova 18 core (Chromium, Molybdenum, Vanadium and Carbon) produces air pockets which help release food while cutting, giving the blade non-stick properties. Legendary industrial designer Komin Yamada brings a new age of innovation to Global cutlery with Sai, unifying function and design, these distinctive Japanese knives combine revolutionary ergonomic handles with triple-layered steel blades that maintain their exceptionally sharp edges. The first new cutlery line produced by Global in more than 25 years, Sai blends the Japanese company's tradition of craftsmanship with modern technological advancements. The knives combine three layers of steel: a core of patented, ultra-hard Cromova 18 Sanso stainless-steel alloy and two outer layers of more flexible 18/8 steel for added strength and resistance to rust. Professional-quality blades are ice-hardened and tempered to increase hardness, resist corrosion and maintain long-lasting sharpness. Each blade is hand-hammered to create hollow air pockets that reduce drag, allowing the blade to glide through food without sticking. 12.5-degree blade edge is mirror-polished by hand for exceptionally long-lasting sharpness. The perfectly balanced handle has an ergonomic thumb rest for a smooth, efficient cutting motion and steady, comfortable grip. Made in Japan."
