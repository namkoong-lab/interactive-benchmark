        "Stunning volatility is the new \"fact of life\" that defines our age. Financial markets fall off cliffs one day, but then stage a recovery the next, only to do it all over again. The switch back and forth is emotionally draining, making us susceptible to irrational responses that can turn manageable problems into huge personal crises. But while there is danger in volatility, there is also the opportunity to profitably juggle the knives that volatility throws your way -- with less risk than you might think. The first step toward profiting from volatility is to understand why these radical ups and downs are taking place now. Jim Jubak's deep and broad-ranging analysis looks into not only the financial but also the economic, market, and social trends, showing how they reinforce each other, including: the consequences of global central banks operating as cash machines, a financial system that will not be reformed, China as the world's largest game of three-card monte, the aging of populations around the world and the resulting war between the young and old, and the large bill we will have for the consequences of environmental externalities such as climate change and energy uncertainty. Jubak analyzes these and other trends, providing practical insights and specific investing strategies that show investors how to respect -- but not be scared of -- market volatility, and how to make smarter investment decisions to profit from and hedge against it."

        "Review",
        "“[An] informative, often entertaining book. … Whether discussing the effects of food and water shortages or the boom-and-bust real estate markets in such diverse enclaves as hipster Williamsburg (Brooklyn) and Boomer Sarasota (Florida), Jubak brightly illuminates the trends shaping our present era. Solid advice for thoughtful investors.” —",
        "Kirkus Reviews",
        "“A thoroughly enjoyable if somewhat unnerving book…. Jubak does a masterful job of describing global volatility trends, their causes and dangers, paying special attention to China. But he also brings volatility home, dealing with real estate prices, educational costs, and the job market…. A worthwhile read.” —",

        "Jim Jubak",
        "has spent twenty-five years writing about the capital markets, beginning in the early 1980s as the editor of",
        "Venture",
        "magazine and later as senior financial editor at",
        "Worth",
        ". In 1997 he joined MSN Money as senior markets editor and started",
        "Jubak's Journal",
        "and the Jubak's Picks portfolio. The MSN software developers were justifiably skeptical that a mere journalist (even one with a Knight Bagehot fellowship in business journalism from Columbia) could beat the market and they issued a challenge: \"If you're so good, track your buys and sells as a real portfolio.\"  That's exactly what he's done ever since, first on MSN Money (with 4 million unique users per month), where Nielsen ranked him the #1 investor columnist on the web, and now on his own blog, JubakPicks.com, launched in 2009, which averages 50,000 unique users per month. His stock-picking track record speaks for itself: the Jubak's Picks portfolio has returned 305% since its inception in May 1997. Jim currently runs two other stock portfolios on JubakPicks.com. Jim now writes for Yahoo Finance."
