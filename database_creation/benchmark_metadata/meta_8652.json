        "Drama. Latino American Studies. Luis Valdez is a leading figure in Hispanic theater with outstanding achievements from a variety of venues from flatbed truck and conventional stages to the silver and small screens. With his many successes Valdez has remained a rebel and an innovator, as well as the re-creator of Hispanic traditions. This book contains three of the most important and critically acclaimed Valdez plays. \"Zoot Suit\" is a play that deals with the infamous \"Pachuco Riots\" in Los Angeles during World War II, Bandido! explores the life and legend of the nineteenth-century California social rebel Tiburcio Vasquez, and I Don't Have to Show You No Stinking Badges! explores media images of Hispanic through a staged recreation of the TV situation comedy genre."
