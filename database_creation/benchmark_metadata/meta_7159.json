        "The constellation of disorders now reccognized as the metabolic syndrome--hypertension, obesity, lipid disorders, and diabetes-- has emerged as a potent threat to the cardiovascular health of millions of Americans. An estimated 22% of American adults have the metabolic syndrome, and the incidence is rising. Physicians must have a better understanding of this cluster of conditions. This handbook explains the history, risk factors, and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in many populations. Other topics include clinical outcomes, drug therapies, clinical diagnoses, and a variety of lifestyle therapies. The text also discusses the latest national guidelines for effective treatment."
