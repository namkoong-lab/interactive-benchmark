        "With this twin baby journal by Stuff 4 Multiples, you'll be able to clearly see when you last fed your twins, how many diapers your twins went through, how long and when your twins slept, as well as record those all important (but easy to forget) firsts. The simple layout enables you to quickly see trends and patterns, allowing you to plan your day, get you and your twins on a schedule, and answer your pediatrician's detailed questions. Most importantly with this twin baby journal, you don't have to remember a thing except of course, where you last left it."
