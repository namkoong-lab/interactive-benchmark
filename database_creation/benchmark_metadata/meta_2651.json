        "Jan Tilley was born and raised in northern Ohio. Rebelling against the \"norm,\" at the age of 20, she packed up everything and moved to Pleasure Island, North Carolina where she and her family lived in the coastal area for 12 years. She now writes from the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. Jan has held a wide array of jobs throughout the years, including newspaper reporter, veterinary assistant, PIO for Emergency Management, and is currently a social worker. But, her most important job has been raising her two daughters. She has been married to her high school sweetheart since 1985.Jan wrote her first novel \"Coming About\" after her oldest daughter went off to college. She began writing about her feelings over the loss of her child to the big bad world. It began as a purging of emotions but as they always do, the characters came alive and took the story down a totally different path that she never expected.She was then bitten by the bug and is now admittedly obsessed with writing. Her second novel \"Embody\" was released and she was recently featured on The Kevin Smith Show where she discussed the book in a live two-hour interview. \"Rogue's Hollow\" is a suspenseful tale fictionally based on a spooky town near where she grew up. \"Jasper's Gift\" is the sequel to \"Coming About.\" Her novel \"I'm Not Listening\" focuses on the paranormal with a bit of romance thrown in as well. She is currently working on  her sixth novel, \"Embrace Your Bad\" which is a psychological, roller-coaster ride through the dark corners of one's mind.Jan is an award-winning author who has been a guest speaker at multiple conferences. Her books have been sold world-wide and she's more than happy to accommodate interviews. She will continue to write her heart out and do her best to entertain you for as long as you'll welcome her into your lives!
