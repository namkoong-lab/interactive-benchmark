        "\"Yes, I would recommend this book to a colleague for adoption. This book covers all domains of the RHIA/RHIT examination. The questions pertain to the material covered in the classes. Also, the questions are similar to questions on the RHIA/RHIT examinations. Also, I like the fact the questions and answers are referenced according to book and page number. I tell my students to take the exams and to review the question they have missed so they have an understanding why they missed the question.\" -Carolyn Stariha, RHIA, Houston Community College, Houston, TX\"All domains are touched on and there are a lot of questions for students to answer to help in determining where their strengths and weaknesses are. Answers, and explanations, in many cases are given. \" - Lorraine Kane, MS, RHIA, SUNYIT Utica, Utica, NY",
