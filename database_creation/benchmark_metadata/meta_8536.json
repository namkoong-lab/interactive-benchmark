        "Sheets' publicist claims that",
        "How to Buy Your First Home or Investment Property with No Down Payment",
        ", Sheets' television \"program\" of 15 years, is the longest-running infomercial in the history of American television--a distinction that may be seen as dubious to some. This book will be a lure for those who have yet to shell out $149 to buy Sheets' home-study course or to attend one of his pricey seminars, but there is little more here than they would get from staying up late to catch Sheets on cable television. Here is the self-congratulatory autobiographical sketch, the giddy promotion, the countless testimonials, the bold promise of \"creat[ing] wealth out of thin air,\" and the inevitable pitch for the \"advanced\" course and the seminar. To be sure, Sheets tantalizes would-be real estate tycoons with advice on buying property, making offers, and property management. He explains the concept of \"positive cash flow,\" collecting rents on property for which no down payment was made; but alas, this is much easier said than done. Regardless, expect demand.",
