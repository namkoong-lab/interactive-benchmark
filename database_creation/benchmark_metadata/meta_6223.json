        "Silicone Hose:Our silicone hose can be used with a variety of pipe sizes and bends. Whether you are looking for a transition (reducer), straight, or angle (45 or 90 degree), we has the perfect silicone couplers for you. Our silicone couplers are operating temperatures from -65 F to 500 F degree (Fahrenheit), which will provide efficient heat reduction to increase pressure and tolerance, that you know they are durable and can withstand the toughest conditions. Our silicone couplers will provide your engine with a one-of-a-kind advantage in performance and style.Clamps:T-Bolt Clamps are a great upgrade to the standard hose clamp. By using a bolt and stud design, T-Clamps can achieve a much more tighter and durable hold for silicon/rubber couplers, rather than the screw and track design of standard clamps.",
