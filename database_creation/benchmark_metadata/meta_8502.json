        "Friendship between a teenage girl and a Whitey Bulger-like crime boss becomes dangerous when she discovers his true identity. Riley Donavan doesn't know that her father is a bookie. She thinks her mother's death was an accident. Riley doesn't realize that the nice old gentleman named Johnny, whom she sits on a bench with each morning, is the ruthless crime boss responsible for her mother's death. Over time, Johnny becomes a father figure to Riley. Johnny is drawn to Riley because she resembles his lost daughter. Riley's curiosity leads her to discover Johnny's true identity. In the end, she must summon the strength to free herself, from both the harassment of a teenage punk, and the protection of a self-deluded killer. Inspired by the Boston underworld and the notorious mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger."

        "Review",
        "\"McLennan ably handles her characters and their crises, though her skill as a writer is most evident in the novel's third part, when the plot keenly unfurls. With moral ambiguity and questionable intentions, the cast lends a disconcerting air to McLennan's solid debut.",

McLennan grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts. She moved to Utah in 1989 to attend the University of Utah and spend time in the mountains. Her debut novel, Falling for Johnny, was inspired by the infamous James \"Whitey\" Bulger who once lived in her neighborhood. When she wrote Falling, Bulger had been missing for sixteen years. The uncanny timing of his arrest with the novel\\'s publication prompted her to correspond with Bulger while he was in prison. Falling for Johnny won an honorable mention in the 2012 Utah Original Writing Competition and the Inkubate Literary Blockbuster Competition. She has a Bachelor\\'s Degree from the University of Utah and an MFA from The Solstice Program where she was awarded a Fellowship for Fiction. Her second novel, Ophelia\\'s War: The Secret Story of a Mormon Turned Madam, was an Editor\\'s Choice by the Historical Novel Society. Dangerous Mercy, the sequel to Ophelia\\'s War, will be published by Five Star Cengage in October 2019.']}"
