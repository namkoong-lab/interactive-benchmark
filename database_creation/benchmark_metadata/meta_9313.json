        "Review",
        "“",
        "Business in Ethical Focus",
        "is an excellent anthology for those who want to think about what really is right and wrong in business ― not just about what causes people to do right and wrong. It contains a diversity of material and so is suitable both for those who want to focus on the justification of economic systems and those who want to focus on the ethics of specific business practices. It does all this for about half the price of its major competitors.” ― Jeffrey Moriarty, Bentley University",
        "“This is a truly comprehensive resource for courses in business and professional ethics. Virtually all of the standard topics covered in such courses are supported with well-chosen, up-to-date articles and case studies. Especially welcome, in my view, is the inclusion of foundational topics in management theory, economic analysis, and theories of distributive justice, which make the book appropriate not only for introductory-level courses but potentially for more senior-level seminars as well.” ― William Buschert, University of Saskatchewan",
        "“This is an excellent collection ― touching on all of the major issues relevant to business ethics, from foundational questions about morality and the nature of business to cutting edge topics. The reach is global both in the sense of including discussion of problems arising international and around the world, and in including perspectives from many different sources and traditions. The inclusion of a discussion of the treatment and rights of workers is especially welcome and important, distinguishing this volume from many others.” ― Matthew Lister, Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania",
