        "once again has plus-sized sleuth Jospehine Fuller caught in the middle of a gruesome murder. When she receives a note from Wolf Lambert, the director of X rated films starring XXL women, Josephine decides to stop and visit him at his winery. Her spur of the moment impulse, however, leads her right into the middle of a murder investigation when a body is found in one of Wolf's wine barrels and her friend Thelma, a supersized porn queen, is one of the leading suspects.Her investigation, however, has to take a backseat to her day job - looking into a women's clinic to see if it is a worthy cause for her wealthy boss to support. Josephine soon discovers that this women's clinic is a cover-up for extreme anti-abortionists. Unfortunately, it's headed up by a gun-toting, self-righteous, religious woman who has taken an instant dislike to Josephine.  Soon Josephine is balancing her time between digging up the secrets of one of the most powerful wine families in the valley and uncovering what exactly is happening behind the closed doors of the clinic. As if that weren't enough, her on-again, off-again relationship with Mulligan seems to have turned back on. If only she can convince him that her involvement with the porn industry is a purely professional interest. Filled with Josephine's common sense approach to life and her ever-present sparkling wit,",

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Talk about a cabernet with body: when the Rubenesque Josephine Fuller pays a friendly visit to porn-producing Napa Valley vintner Wolf Lambert, she discovers a murder victim in one of his wine barrels in Lynne Murray's A Ton of Trouble. Keeping her day job for philanthropist Alicia Madrone but accepting a bit of remuneration from Wolf for her troubles, Josephine embarks on a quest to find the killer and uncovers drugs, snipers, winery feuds, fetish films and an anti-abortion \"baby mill\" with typical good humor and panache.

        "From Library Journal",
        "Intrigued by a letter from an alcoholic acquaintance who runs a Napa Valley winery, extra-large sleuth Josephine Fuller (At Large) decides to visit. The man, who also makes adult films starring super-sized women, turns up seriously sloshed, chases Josephine, and unwittingly uncovers a dead body in a barrel. Josephine and her new boyfriend then begin sleuthing. Josephine's regular job as investigator for a wealthy woman's family foundation provides additional plot ballast and variety as well. Frequent humor, a titillating subject matter, and crazy characters guarantee a good time for readers of this fourth Josephine Fuller mystery. Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "Retired horror-film director Wolf Lambert, an odd, old acquaintance of Jo Fuller's, now spends his time hanging out at his winery and making porn films featuring large women. When Jo visits the winery, she finds a body in a wine barrel who turns out to be the despicable scion of another Napa wine family. All that ends up tied to Jo's work as an investigator for a small foundation that gives funds to worthy causes. Jo, like Camryn Mannheim in both size and sass, lets antiabortionists and Overeaters Anonymous have it with both barrels. Along the way, she also, with a recognizable mixture of disgust and fascination, looks in on the making of porn videos, sharing lots of amusing details (e.g., the use of pina-colada mix to represent a certain masculine fluid). Jo's dinner with Ambrose, the elegant gay assistant to her wealthy employer, is itself worth the price of admission.",
