        "Essential oils in their natural state possess a complexity that is difficult to reproduce. Some oils contain substances that do not occur anywhere else in nature. Our experts at Nature’s Alchemy delight in seeking out the rarest desert plants or most exotic tropical foliage to create a rich variety of essential oils. So indulge in a perfumed lotion, try a scented oil massage, or diffuse into your environment. Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you."
