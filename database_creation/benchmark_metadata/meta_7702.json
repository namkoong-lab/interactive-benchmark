        "About the Author",
        "Gordon Bok has been writing and gathering music since the sixties, when he was a major influence in the folk music revival of that time: songs and ballads, instrumentals, music from the Mongolian Kalmyks, Australia, the British Isles, the Caribbean and around the world, from the sea and sailing, the islands and mainlands, family, strangers and dreams. He has made more than a score of albums, and many other musicians have recorded his songs. He has been touring in the U.S., Canada, the British Isles and Europe for over forty years and has become one of the most beloved performers of the folk music world."
