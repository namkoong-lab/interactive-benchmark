        "It’s 2157, and the world already ended once. Humanity recovered. Now what?",
        "The Earth Global Initiative formed to protect and insulate humanity from an epidemic annihilating the world’s population. After trying to combat the devastation wrought by the disease, they corralled the survivors inside their ‘New’ cities until a cure was found.",
        "That was forty years ago, and as the EGI’s new status quo has beaten the people into submissive apathy, groups aiming to rip them out of power have formed. One such group possesses the ability to do just that, but the time isn’t right. All the pieces are not yet in place…",
        "Seth Renquist owes his survival to the EGI military and has made a career of uncovering some of the worst humanity has to offer. But what he’s about to learn will lead him down a path that will engulf the world in flames.",

        "From the Author",
        "Hey! You! Potential reader! If you read the blurb above and are in the middle of scrolling down to check the reviews, then stop here a second and let me tell you a bit more about this book (and for the record, I've decided to put this up because the blurb really only describes the setting and the very beginning of the story. I've redone it so many times that I've hit the point of diminishing returns. So, here we go.) Put simply, Dethroned is a bit of a Sci-fi buffet. You get a little dystopian, a little post-apocalyptic, and a little military sci-fi with a dash of cyberpunk (definitely less on the cyber and more on the punk, though).The cast of characters isn't necessarily anything you haven't seen before, but as always there's a bit of a twist to each of them. We've got the assassin who can't kill anymore, the cop whose partner got framed, the ex-soldier who hates civilian life, and the career military officer whose worldview gets shattered. Again, nothing necessarily new. At least until a revolutionary comes along and wrangles them all together to do a job that would, effectively, flick the first domino in a plot for global upheaval.The thing to note, and this is a minor spoiler, is that the first half of the first book (which is only 4 chapters, mind you) is basically a collection of short stories that introduce the characters I mentioned above. It's definitely sluggish at times, as far as pacing goes, and can certainly feel like a bit of an info dump as well. But given the nature of the characters, it kinda works. See, this isn't like some hero's journey where you start on a farm and end punching a god in the mouth. All these characters have plenty of history from before the word Silence appears on the first page, and are all fully actualized as people whether they grow or regress as things proceed. Because of this format, once chapter 5 hits, the story is just able to take off and charge forward with reckless abandon.",

        "PROLOGUE: SalvationSilence. Hundreds of people have come to listen to what this man and his cohorts have to say. As the first of several speakers, he stands alone, taking in the quiet, and observing the crowd. It was the first time he'd been tasked with an engagement at a rally such as this, and though they may not be present, he knew that his superiors were watching. With all eyes on him, the time for nerves and idleness had passed, so he began.\"I have seen you.\" He began softly, almost sounding sad, but then his voice quickly grew stronger. \"I have lived among you and seen the detestable conditions you toil away in. From the Lowers of New Shanghai, to the Outer Quarters of New Berlin, and the Favela of New Brasilia, I have seen you! There is no spark, no light, no dream in your eyes. No hope...\" He paused.\"But today- Today you come bearing a question. What can we of the Acian Movement do for you that the Earth Global Initiative will not?\"The man began pacing across the stage, using his body to punctuate his words. He looked down, as if deep in thought, before he suddenly stopped, turned, and looked back to the crowd.\"We have heard your question and it is a fair one. Why should you put your faith in a group that may not succeed in making your lives even a little better? So many others have tried before, only to fail before they truly began.\" He paused, allowing a moment of quiet. \"Before I can answer that, I must ask, what are you willing to contribute to ensure that we do not fail?\"Some members of the crowd shook their heads or scoffed at him, so he addressed them.\"I understand your reasoning. Why should you sacrifice anything, when you have precious little to give as it is? When many among you can barely find enough work to feed yourselves now. When you look at those of higher status and wonder if there will be a day when you can become like them. When the Earth Global Initiative has left its promise of deliverance unfulfilled. Believe me, I understand.\"They were hooked, now to reel them in.\"It's been forty years since the Plague was defeated, and what do many of us have to show for it? Nothing! Nothing has changed!\" He cleared his throat. \"Humanity was on the verge of conquering the stars before the Collapse. It was a veritable utopia. But not all was well in paradise. Our careless greed caused the ice to melt, the seas to rise, and release upon us a plague that took the lives of nearly two thirds of our people!\"The man grew solemn.\"And so, the EGI was formed. They clambered to hold back the tide of this disease and bring us back from our civilization's utter collapse. They used every resource available to find a solution - to find a cure. There were quarantines and purges of the infected. Mountains of bodies put to fire. They tried everything. There was even talk of a mass exodus from the planet, but they ultimately chose to build the gargantuan city-fortresses that we reside in today.\"\"They cannibalized the great settlements of the past to build their newer, more secure cities. And so, we survived, holed up behind our walls. Families were broken apart, people lived in constant fear, and still thousands died of starvation in those first few years. But we endured.\"The man couldn't help but smile. There was no humor or joy in it, but smile he did.\"As we all know, in the years since, conditions have become worse and worse for those of lower birth - those descended from the world's poor. Every night, you hope that when you wake up, the world will be a better place. You toil away among the garbage lining the streets of your districts trying to find something to trade or sell for food. All the while, politicians and highborn not worth their weight in steel congratulate themselves in the Capital District of New Berlin for a job well done.\"There was a pause, and he looked at the ground. The crowd was his, body and soul.\"No. We are not your saviors...\" His gaze roved across the crowd, meeting their hopeful, sad, or defiant eyes, reeling them into the future he desired. \"But we offer you the opportunity to carve out salvation of your own! The chance to help us build a better world. A world where the status of your birth no longer constricts how high you can rise. Where education is no longer gated behind enlistment in a military that no longer serves any purpose. Where the greed of the few no longer damages this world shared by the many!\"Cheers spread like wildfire. He reveled in their praise, raising his hands to the sky.\"But I have one final question for you.\" His hand swept across the masses before him. \"What are you willing to give to achieve these goals? What are you willing to sacrifice so that we - as a people - can claw our way out of the pit our forebears dug us into?\"He was nearly shouting, now. \"Our Movement will give you the opportunity to undo the damage done to our world and build it better, but only if you are willing to lend your strength to ours!\"The crowd was a sea of hands and fists in the air. The man bowed and left the stage. He couldn't help but wonder how the next speaker was going to top his delivery, nor could he stop himself from smiling.All pride drained from his face when he saw the woman waiting for him behind the curtain. Her dress bore the red, black, and gray of the Acian Movement. She brushed some strands of dark hair from her face and smiled placidly. \"That was a good speech, Jens.\"\"Thank you, Ms. Khan.\" He smiled back, trying to quell the rising anxiety surrounding her presence at the rally. She clapped her hands, and Jens snapped to attention.\"There is a call waiting for you in the office. He seemed pleased.\"\"That's good.\" Jens swallowed. \"I'll go speak to him right away.\"\"See that you do. Best of luck, Mr. Ryker.\" Her empty, placid smile never faded as she floated away to watch the next speaker. Jens shuddered. Something about that woman distressed him to no end. He took a deep breath, straightened himself out, and stalked off toward the office."
