        "Since the death of her husband three years ago, Meena's mother has wanted to see her oldest daughter married and so she organizes Meena's \"seeing ceremony,\" a ritual associated with arranged marriages. However, eighteen-year-old Meena is not ready to be married and wants to leave her hilltop home in Mahagiri, south India, and attend college in California. The ceremony is a disaster. Her four years in America soon comes to an end and Meena is eager to return home and share her newly-acquired knowledge of agriculture and tea production with her family. On her journey back to India, Meena meets handsome businessman Raj Kumar with whom she has an instant connection. They end up talking for hours in the airport lounge. When they part at the departure gate, Meena doesn't think she'll ever see Raj again. Back in Mahagiri, her mother faces a threat to her home and livelihood. Meena could avert this disaster by agreeing to an arranged marriage. Will Meena have to go through yet another \"seeing ceremony?\""

        "\"There's a bravado in Meera Klein's",
        "Seeing Ceremony",
        ", as expansive a courage as there is in eighteen-year old Meena, a daughter determined to reject an arranged marriage in tradition-bound Indian culture where elders match a groom by religion, profession, caste, and horoscope. To witness her own mother's supportive objections to the ceremony is to know the limits of the heart's misguided ties to repressive gender-based fealties. Only a father's legacy of a spice plantation's comforting presence inspires the primal force to pursue studies in America, a world-education beyond her own. Klein's rhythmically mastered cadence follows Meena's pilgrimage to independence with an extravagant feast of sensory imagery, from taro roots and the Keatsian-styled spice scents of biryami and cardamon to the metaphoric ritual of devotees walking Irumudi sacks up the 18 steps of the Ayappan Temple. Such is the universality of experience in Klein's writing as aromas of food and exotic landscapes nurture those who inhabit Meena's world of Mahagiri, from an aunty matchmaker to a fortune teller to a young man whose chance meeting impassions him to join Meena's enlightened quest to rediscover change as the only thing that is constant. What a delightfully romantic excursion Klein makes of it. You will be seduced if not educated by the intertwining narratives of change as the primal force that brings her back to her beloved Mahagiri, a fertile place of hope and renewal, the very qualities that define this wondrous book.\"                                                                  James Ragan                                                                  author of",
