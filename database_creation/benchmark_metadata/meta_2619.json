        "The book and series are inspired by the research developed by developmental biologist, Charles Piaget who said, \"The young child attributes life to activity and this activity facilitates his thinking ability and learning. The child then begins to be aware that movement is the essence of things around him, and he discovers himself through movement...he begins to think as he moves. The child then is developing not only through the psychomotor domain, but also through the affective and cognitive domain.",
