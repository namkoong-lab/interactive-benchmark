        "Having achieved great success over the course of four decades as a veteran songwriter, producer, and performer, Steve Tyrell steps forward in 1999 with an Atlantic debut that dramatically captures the magic that has instilled memorable musical moments into the hit",
        "Father Of The Bride",
        "movies. With the tellingly-titled SMILE, the L.A.-based Tyrell expands and enhances familiar classics and makes them his own. Combined with Tyrell's engaging arrangements and marked by his flair for unique phrasings, the resulting tracks are sure to win cheers from both standards enthusiasts and those with an affection for songs that simply say it all. More than the fabric of our shared musical heritage, these stellar songs remain unrivaled in their ability to touch hearts and define the emotions that otherwise elude concise explanation. That said, the multi-talented Tyrell - the author behind such pop hits as the chart-topping \"How Do You Talk to an Angel\" and producer of Andy Griffith's 1997 Grammy Award-winning gospel album, I Love To Tell the Story - proves inspired in his handling of such timeless tunes as \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" as he performed in 1991's Father of the Bride.",

        "Review",
        "Steve Tyrell working commercially as a songwriter, producer, and performer for more than four decades. His \"Atlantic Records\" debut, \"A New Standard,\" came about as a result of his standards recordings for the \"Father of the Bride\" movies. \"I've always considered myself a song man,\" says Tyrell. \"And if anything, that's the part of my nature that I poured into making this album.\" To do justice to the spirit of the classic songs on this album, Tyrell chose his soloists carefully. For \"I've Got the World on a String,\" Tyrell sought out horn player Harry \"Sweets\" Edison, who passed away shortly after this recording. Because Edison was featured on many of Sinatra's most famous recordings, Tyrell thought he was the only choice for this Sinatra classic.",
