        "Snug and breathable snow machine cover provides year round indoor and outdoor protection against finish destroying agents such as the sunshine, rain, snow, dust, dirt, tree sap, bird droppings, salt, slush, mud or other elements. Designed for Storage and travel purposes. Made from Technologically advanced 600 Denier Woven Polyester canvas material. Enjoy your next cross-country/backcountry sled trip with a like-new snowmobile and clean seat every time. Cover comes with a free stuff sack for portability. Take your snowmobile cover with you, even ice fishing with your crew! Packs small. Will not scratch clear-coat. The elastic bungee in the hemline holds the cover snug to the chassis/track for a secure fit. Metal hook straps keep the cover secure. Cover is breathable and allows air to circulate through the pores between fibers, yet remain woven tightly enough that the surface tension of water or ice melt will not penetrate, it will roll right off. Dual travel air vents allow excess air to escape without cover lofting or ballooning and securely sewn rear reflector strips help ensure that your sled is clearly visible at night or while trailering home at the end of a long day on the back country trail. This cover is measured to fit the sled indicated with a semi-custom fitment. We make many covers compatible with arctic cat, polaris, yamaha, skidoo and more. Our semi-custom cover designs are compatible with most snowmobiles in the industry. Custom fitted covers are available, please ask. IMPORTANT: This item will fit the sled specified WITHOUT aftermarket equipment, modification, or accessories. If your snowmobile/snowmachine has accessories such as a longer track, tall windshield, saddlebags, handlebar risers, or similar, please confirm fit with us prior to purchase. Ideal for both indoor or outdoor use. 2 YEAR WARRANTY. This canvas cover listing fits the 2004 2005 2006 Polaris 700 RMK"
