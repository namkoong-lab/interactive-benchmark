        "\"Activity and Game Book - Basic Skills for 6-7 Years Olds\" presents more difficult games and activities so that, after the last page of this title, children finish by reading and writing, just as in school. They have to read easy words and very short texts while playing (connect an animal to its name, circle a letter that can be found in a word, circle a sentence that does not correspond to a picture, etc.) They count, add, subtract, and also write; time telling exercises complete this extraordinary activity book."
