        "Of all the American masters, Edgar Allan Poe staked out perhaps the most unique and vivid reputation, as a master of the macabre. Even today, in the age of horror movies and high-tech haunted houses, Poe is the first choice of entertainment for many who want a spine-chilling thrill.",
        "Born in Boston in 1809, and dead at the age of 40, Poe wrote across several fields during his life, noted for his poetry and short stories as well as his criticism. The best of each of these is collected here, including the classic poem “The Raven,” and timeless stories like “The Tell-Tale Heart.” In his introduction to this volume, G. R. Thompson argues that Poe was a great satirist and comedic craftsman, as well as a formidable Gothic writer. “All of Poe’s fiction,” Thompson writes, “and the poems as well, can be seen as one coherent piece—as the work of one of the greatest ironists of world literature.”",

        "But should it be-that dream eternallyContinuing-as dreams have been to meIn my young boyhood--should it thus be given,'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven!For I have revell'd, when the sun was brightIn the summer sky; in dreamy fields of light, And left unbeedingly my very heart In climes of mine imagining--apart From mine own home, with beings that have been Of mine own thought--wbat more could I have seen?",
        "'Twas once and only once and the wild hour From my remembrance shall not pass-some power Or spell had bound me-'twas the chilly wind Came o'er me in the night and left behind Its image on my spirit, or the moon Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon Too coldly-or the stars-howe'er it was That dream was as that night wind-let it pass.",

However, Poe is best known for his works of the macabre, including such infamous titles as The Raven, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, Lenore, and The Fall of the House of Usher. Part of the American Romantic Movement, Poe was one of the first writers to make his living exclusively through his writing, working for literary journals and becoming known as a literary critic. His works have been widely adapted in film. Edgar Allan Poe died of a mysterious illness in 1849 at the age of 40.']}"
