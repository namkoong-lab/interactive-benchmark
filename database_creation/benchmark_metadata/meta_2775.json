        "With over 10,000 reviews and a 4.4 star average, this series is not to be missed. This 7-book boxed set includes the 6-book (complete) Filthy F*cker MC Romance Series of full-length stand-alone MC Romance novels, each of which follows the life of one member of the Filthy F*ckers Motorcycle Club. Based in Oceanside, California, the Filthy F*ckers are an outlaw motorcycle club that seeks vengeance on those they feel escape the hand of the law. Each member of the club depicted (our bike-riding heroes) are loyal, protective, and sexy as hell. In the beginning, none are in an active relationship. For this club, the MC is the only relationship they need. When each respective love interest comes along, everything clanges. As a whole, this set includes no cheating, no sex outside the relationship, and each has its respective HEA. Additionally, the series has an HEA, wrapping everything up with a nice little bow in the end of book 6. This series includes all 6 books of the Filthy Fuckers MC Romance series, and the spin-off book, His Rules, as a bonus."
