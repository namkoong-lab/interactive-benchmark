An elderly Indian woman from his own Reservation has hired him to help discover who murdered her grandson, but she seems strangely uninterested in the results. Her attitude seems heartless, but as Rodeo pursues interrelated cases, he learns that the old woman's indifference is nothing compared to true hatred, and aligned against a variety of creative and cruel foes, the hard-pressed PI is about to discover just how far hate can go.",

        "“One of the strongest debuts to come along in years.” ―",
        "Cleveland Plain Dealer",
        "“Bleak but elegantly told. … McKenzie's voice is as dry and gritty as desert sand, just right for scouring this harsh landscape of cheap motels, run-down trailer parks and Indian trading posts selling polyester blankets.” ―",
        "The New York Times Book Review",
        "“An outstanding first novel written with clarity and authority and featuring a Southwest whose spare beauty covers unspeakable crimes and a detective who's tough, honorable and authentic to the core.” ―",
        "Kirkus (starred review)",
        "“This dirt-filled noir debut about a former rodeo cowboy turned private investigator has already earned comparisons to Cormac McCarthy, and the stark Southwestern setting might hold you over if you're still suffering from",

Boiled 'til the shell burst, boiled dry as adobe. … This is a very absorbing, fast, tough crime novel, set in Arizona Indian country and bound to be compared as much to the literary novelist Cormac McCarthy as to the late suspense master Tony Hillerman, who operated in these parts, and whose name is on a prize won by this very novel. … McKenzie is going to be demanding, and repaying, close attention for a long while.” ―",
