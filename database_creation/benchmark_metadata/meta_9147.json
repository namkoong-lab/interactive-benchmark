        "The past two decades have seen the growth of feminist biblical studies into a significant force within biblical scholarship. This landmark work brings the fruits of these labors together into a single fascinating collection. Like previous single-volume commentaries, this provides introduction and comments on each book of the Protestant Bible (with a brief treatment of the apocryphal writings). Unlike the others, however, this work is not a traditional commentary, which entails explaining the whole of each biblical book. Rather, the writers focus on \"portions . . . that deal explicitly with female characters and symbols . . . and sections that bear upon the condition of women generally.\" Although the contributors share this goal, they take different paths. In addition to the commentary itself, there are helpful essays on feminist hermeneutics and daily life in biblical times. This commentary will raise eyebrows, and it will raise consciousness as well. It will not be well received in all quarters, but it is essential for those who are seriously interested in biblical and feminist studies. Recommended for seminary, university, and public libraries.",
