        "A special baby has been born tonight, but where can he possibly be? Join the shepherd boy, Gabriel, on Christmas night as he goes in search of the newborn king and finds him in the most unlikely place. Each page of this highly engaging board book contains a “door” progressively smaller than the last, which gives the illusion of journeying deeper and deeper into the environment."
