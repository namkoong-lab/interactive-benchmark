        "Drama set in Huntingdon, West Virginia, telling the true story of Marshall University's 'Thunder Herd' football team. For the team and the community, Marshall football is more than just a sport: it's a way of life. But on a fateful night in 1970, while travelling back to Huntingdon after a game in North Carolina, 75 members of Marshall's football team and coaching staff were killed in a plane crash. As those left behind struggled to cope with the devastating loss of their loved ones, the grieving families found hope and strength in the leadership of Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), a young coach who was determined to rebuild Marshall's football programme and, in the process, help to heal a community."
