        "Product Description",
        "New Orleans bluesman Bryan Lee has packed almost every venue hes played in. While many artists never break out of their hometowns, Bryan is a great example of one who has, and his reputation stretches from his native USA up to Canada and over to France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and other countries. Therefore its fitting that Bryan Lees tenth Justin Time recording is a live one, recorded in one of the cities that has embraced him as one of its own  Montreal. This riveting performance is also Justin Times first DVD production",
        "Recorded at Montreal's legendary Spectrum on October 17, 2003, Bryan Lee and his band delivered a concert filled with the emotional intensity and pure passion, reminding us that Lees talent is best captured in a live setting. Hes an energetic, direct and often spellbinding performer, unafraid to show the often deep emotion that is part of his life and of his lifes work. The set surveys a best of Bryan Lee from The Bounce to Memphis Bound (both his own tunes) and 12 classic Lee rides in between: a slow minor blues in Blues On My Mind, shuffles like Rocket 88.",
        "Review",
        "Lee fires up his electric guitar and sings 'em with a youthful voice and convincing inflection. He's the real article. --",
