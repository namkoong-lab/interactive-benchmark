        "Review",
        "Set in the remote Maine town of New Hope in the late 1980s, this exceptionaldebut novel is an enticing blend of supernatural fiction, horror and oneyoung woman's coming-of-age.This novel-which works equally well as a YA or adult read-revolves largelyaround almost-17-year-old Miri Jones, daughter of the town's police chief.Attractive, intelligent, athletic and tenaciously inquisitive, Jones' dreamis to follow somewhat in her father's footsteps, perhaps working as aninvestigator for the FBI. When she discovers the corpse of a young man whilejogging on a woodland trail, she embraces her inner Nancy Drew and vows tosolve the mystery, even though her father warns her to stay away. With herbabysitting charge-13-year-old Christopher Marlowe-as partner, the youngdetective duo sets out to unravel the circumstances leading up to thebizarre murder. Marlowe, however, is hiding a bombshell of a secret, andonce Jones discovers what Marlowe is concealing, the investigation takes ahorrific turn. Jones' worldview is obliterated when she learns that not onlydo creatures such as vampires and werewolves exist-they are in her own town!Accompanied by a small group of friends, Jones and Marlowe uncoverjaw-dropping revelations that could very well get them-and those theylove-brutally killed. So many aspects of the story are outstanding:character development, plot intricacy, innovative twists on old myths,setting-Hobbs nails the late '80s vibe with references to Van Halen, BobSeger, Steve Grogan of the New England Patriots, etc.-and narrativeintensity. Also of note is the novel's sardonic sense of humor; even in themost perilous of situations, the teenage protagonists still have wits enoughto come up with some great comments: e.g., \"By the way, there's a lot ofvampire crap at the library.\" It's fitting that Stephen King is mentioned inthe storyline. This debut from Hobbs, who was raised in Maine, is very muchcomparable in tone and ambiance to King's debut novel, Carrie (1974).Ten \"Must Read\" Self-Published Vampire Fiction Novels of 2014 - BLUEINK REVIEWS",
