        "Pig and Cat are pals who like to bike, swim, read, and make art together. One day Pig notices Dog, who has a very interesting kite. Pig and Dog play, and Cat feels neglected and lonely. But Pig and Dog are generous souls after all; and now Pig, Cat and Dog are pals . . . who skateboard and surf! Visually exciting art is executed with crayon and colored pencil on manila paper, in a style that is both sophisticated and childlike. Interesting details in the art add layers of storytelling."

        "PreS-Gr 1—In this series entry, readers follow the anthropomorphic frolics of pink Pig and gray-striped Cat as they bike, swim, read, paint, and play hide-and-seek. One day, Pig spots a yellow dog flying a fish kite and their friendship ensues, excluding the tabby. Soon, Dog reaches out a paw and invites Cat to join them in skateboarding. Though the jacket guide claims the story is for \"Level C readers,\" it would be appreciated by those less skilled. Florian (Pig is Big) has mixed success with the cartoons. The crayon and colored pencil artwork on manila paper suffers when the background palettes overpower the cheery details; some minor characters are difficult to see at all. However, in scenes like the bright blue swimming pool, the humor, and variety of other players shine. VERDICT This short and simple story serves to enhance reader confidence with its repetition in text.—Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA",
