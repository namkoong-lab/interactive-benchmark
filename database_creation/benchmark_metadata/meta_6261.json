        "Qty 1 x PURPLE -10/DASH 10 AN Straight Swivel Fitting Matches TiAL Purple About ColorFittings: Our fittings are machined from a solid block of aluminum, and conform to AN spec tolerances. The colors on our fittings are produced through a hard anodizing process after being polished. This process gives a tough, durable, and consistent finish. We offer fittings in green, purple, red, copper, black, and blue and can accommodate custom colors for larger orders. Put bluntly, this is the best fitting money can buy in terms of seal, finish, and assembly."
