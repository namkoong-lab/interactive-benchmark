Restored Dreamer.', 'Rachel Dawn grew up in a small farm town in Kentucky often working on her family’s dairy and tobacco farm. Entrepreneurial at heart, she started her first business at 16. Rachel met and married her “prince charming” young (as many small-town girls do), and embarked on an exciting life, certain she was destined for success and happiness.', 'Then, it all fell apart.', 'By 25 she found herself divorced, discouraged, disenchanted, and starting over. The lessons she learned rebuilding her life, regaining her courage, and reigniting her dreams have since inspired countless others. Today, she has a wonderful husband, two crazy dogs, and a thriving career that continues to challenge her to find new ways to overcome obstacles and live victoriously.', 'She writes and speaks with transparency and vulnerability, telling humorous and impactful stories from her own life about resiliency, and overcoming painful, unpredictable circumstances despite insurmountable odds, whether at work or at home. Whether reading her work or listening to her speak, it feels as if she’s chatting one-on-one over a cup of coffee.', 'When asked why she started blogging/writing:', 'I have wanted to be a writer since the 3rd grade, I was always a story-teller. My teacher that year, Ms Franks, told me, “You have such a strong voice in your writing, you should be an author one day!”. But I had no idea what that would look like, or that it would manifest at 30.', 'When I was young, I believed I would write murder-mystery novels and poetry. I do still write poetry. But over the last two years, God has done miraculous things in my life and at the same time is requiring me to do something about it in return: To tell MY story.', 'My very-wise mentor, Jennifer Beckham, recommended I start a blog to develop a platform/following of people who are hearing me.', 'I don’t pretend to think I am important, or well-known, but I do know that my story will be used by Him to help a lot of people and I am passionate about getting it in their hands, and in their hearts.', 'My blog is a place where I will share bits and pieces of my story, and my imperfections, as well as other things I learn and inspirational things I come across.', 'I hope you find it a place of refreshing, of hope, and of encouragement.']}"
