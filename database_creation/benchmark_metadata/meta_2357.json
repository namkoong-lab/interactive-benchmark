        "In a world destroyed by greed and power only the strongest survive. In the wilderness, death lurks as bands of raiders, and recreated monsters, seek easy prey. Against threats both human, and prehistoric, Chris Spencer must survive enemies from all sides, and all species. With the help of a man with no history, and no memory, Chris faces his toughest challenge: civilisation. Working in the biggest city he is tasked with clearing the unwelcomed visitors preying on the residents. Dinosaurs on one side, politics on the other, the Hunter must use his wits, cunning, and instinct to survive."

        "From the Author",
        "Good morrow avid reader. This is my first novel, and my only published work outside of a few enthusiast magazines. Originally only a practice for work to come, my reading group liked it so much I decided to publish. There are faults and mistakes, but I'm learning, and if the reviews are anything to go by, I'm not doing too bad. Thanks for taking the time to read it, and I hope you enjoy.",

        "A self confessed bibliophile from birth I've been writing since I was a teenager. The Hunter is my first decent sized novel, and my first published work outside of enthusiast club magazines. My interest in everything technical and strange gives me plenty of ideas to draw from, and an overactive imagination means there are plenty of options going.I live in the Midlands in England with my wife Deborah, a small collection of strange cars and motorbikes, and a lot of books.For daily updates find me on Facebook: James Manning Author."
