        "No one knows precisely what Elian went through when he was young, but it feeds the death and destruction of his visions. Sixteen years old and the Seer of his generation, the survival of many rests on his shoulders. A war is coming and Elian’s determination to stop it is the only hope left against the evil scourging the nine lands beyond the Gate."
