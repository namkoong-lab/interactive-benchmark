        "My newest client doesn't seem to care. He just wants his office remodeled.His college-aged daughter isn't my usual type, but under those prim clothes and too big glasses, the sweet little bookworm hides a tight little body that's tempting AF.I make her nervous. I should. I'm going to make her mine.She doesn't know about men yet...She's about to learn.",
        "Author's Confession: This book is super sweet, unfailingly filthy, and the heroine is nerdilicious. And who doesn't love a bad boy who's good with his hands? Very good with his hands. Very, very good. Brody is the Alphamallow you've been waiting for. If you like opposites attract, other side of the track, bad boy/good girl romances with instalove and over the top feelz, you're in the right place."

        "From the Author",
        "The Blue Collar Bad Boy series is really all about me. What I wanted to read. Don't get me wrong...I like the billionaire as much as the next girl...but there is something so hot about a man who can be alpha without money, without the privileges of wealth. The real man who uses his body and his masculine power to make his way, to take care of what's his, to forge life on his terms.You know...the total UNF Factor.So that's who these guys are. You'll note they tend to be caretaker alpha because that's my favorite...the growly, broody man who finds his woman and that's it. He's gone for her. And he doesn't want to change a thing about her--but he will nurture her and keep her safe. When I decided to take on a new pen name, I wanted to go over the top and dirty. So, of course, my first heroine comes to me fully fleshed out as...a nerdy girl who's life goal is to be a contestant on",
