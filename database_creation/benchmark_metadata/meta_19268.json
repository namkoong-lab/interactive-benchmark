    "description": [
        "The Anderson Metals street tee pipe fitting is made of forged brass and has female and male National Pipe Taper (NPT) threaded connections. This street tee is a T-shaped fitting with three openings used to connect and branch three female and male pipes, two on the main run and one branch at a 90-degree angle from the middle of the tee. Pipe dimensions for tees are represented as A x B x C. \"A\" and \"B\" indicate the main run on the fitting, and \"C\" indicates the branch. It has female and male NPT threads on either end of the main run and female NPT threads on the branch outlet for connecting to three threaded pipes. The NPT threads create a tighter seal than straight threads. This fitting is made of brass for corrosion resistance, ductility at high temperatures, and low magnetic permeability, and it is forged to increase the material's strength and resistance to mechanical shock and vibration. The operating temperatures for this fitting range from -53 to 121 degrees C (-65 to 250 degrees F). This fitting meets American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) B584 and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)/American National Standards Institute (ANSI) B16 specifications for quality assurance.",
        "Pipe fittings are components used for connecting, terminating, controlling flow, and changing the direction of piping in many different industries. When purchasing pipe fittings, consider the application, as this will affect material type, shape, size, and required durability. Fittings are available threaded or unthreaded, in many shapes, styles, sizes, and schedules (pipe wall thickness).",
        "Anderson Metals manufactures brass fittings, valves, and pipe nipples. The company, founded in 1951, is headquartered in Kansas City, MO."
