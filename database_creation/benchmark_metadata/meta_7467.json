Her goal is to add more Asian representation into the world of children's books. She's also written a variety of children's books including bilingual children's books in Chinese and English for non-native speakers. When her daughter, Mina, was born, Liu searched for well-illustrated, dual-language children’s books in Pinyin and English, but was surprised at how little she could find. Committed to giving Mina the opportunity to become bilingual, Liu created a series of children's books in Chinese and English. The stories focus on simple everyday dialogue with beautiful and engaging illustrations to introduce the Chinese language to young learners in a fun and easy way. Her goal is to continue to provide learning resources for non-native Chinese speakers who wish to foster dual-language skills with their children. Her books are available in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese and Cantonese and include an audio reading in Chinese.\", \"Check out Katrina Liu's other books.\", 'For more information, visit www.lycheepress.com or follow her on instagram @minalearnschinese']}"
