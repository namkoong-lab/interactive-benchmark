        "There are so many different sports and workouts, but it is not all convenient for you to put the apple watch (iwatch) on your wrist, for example, kick-boxing is a great high-energy workout but the gloves completely cover your wrist. In this case, if you don't like taking off your watch and missing the training data, you can consider to put it on your ankle instead of your wrist. It's very simply to use our ankle band as like using watch band, just slide off your watch bands and link the ankle band to the watch. It keeps your watch viewable and controllable as well, giving you an different alternate way to wear your watch! USER GUIDE: 1) Remove your current watch band 2) Slide the ankle band adapter into the slots of your apple watch body 3) Pull your foot through the ankle band, move it to your ankle where you feel comfortable and natural 4) Unfold one of the hook-and-loop end fasteners and adjust the strap to fit your ankle snugly 5) Fold over the hook-and-loop end fastener and close itUsing Tips:  Please do not use alcohol or alcohol-based hand cleaner to wipe the strap, as they will damage the glue of the strap and cause the strap fall apart."
