Upon arrival, her relatives gave her a large Mother Goose collection. As she learned English through those rhymes, she had no idea that someday she would become a best-selling children's book author and illustrator, and would extend many them into books for little ones. Her first book in the series, The Itsy Bitsy Spider has sold over 2.5 million copies, and her Twinkle Twinkle Little Star has sold over 1 million. Her books are widely used in schools in the US and abroad and have won numerous awards. Iza lives in the Hudson Valley of New York, and when not in her studio, she enjoys spending time outdoors- hiking, mountain biking, skiing and kayaking. You can learn more about Iza and her books at www.izatrapani.com\"]}"
