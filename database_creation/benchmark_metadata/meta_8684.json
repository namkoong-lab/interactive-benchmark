        "Taken into Custody' exposes the greatest and most destructive civil rights abuse in America today. Family courts and Soviet-style bureaucracies trample basic civil liberties, entering homes uninvited and taking away people's children at will, then throwing the parents into jail without any form of due process, much less a trial. No parent, no child, no family in America is safe. The legal industry does not want you to hear this story. Radical feminists, bar associations, and social work bureaucracies have colluded to suppress this information. Even pro-family\"\" groups and civil libertarians look the other way. Yet it is a reality for tens of millions of Americans who are our neighbors.\"\""

        "Why is the American family in crisis? Political scientist Stephen Baskerville argues that the most direct cause is the divorce industry itself: a corrupt government-run system that abuses parents and children, runs rampant over civil liberties, steals the wealth of families, and is accountable to no one.",
        "Nothing like this has ever before happened in America. Driven by an extremist version of feminist ideology and highly bureaucratic, the divorce machine resembles the totalitarian regimes of the last century in its erosion of privacy. Political correctness inhibits scholars and reporters from investigating it, and clichés and euphemisms obscure the ugly reality of how much arbitrary power government officials exercise over people's lives.",
