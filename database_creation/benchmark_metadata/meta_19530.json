Join Rudy Maxa, public radio's original Savvy Traveler and contributing editor for National Geographic Traveler magazine, for an unforgettable tour of the fascinating cities and regions that have captivated world travelers for centuries. From the tango parlors of Buenos Aires to the bazaars of Istanbul, Maxa brings home the history, culture, architecture, cuisine, and personality of each destination. No matter how you see the world, Maxa makes travel sophisticated accessible to everyone. Stunning High-definition cinematography captures an authentic travel adventure you will only find in Rudy Maxa's World! Istanbul In this thoroughly modern city, the architecture, cuisine and customs reflect Istanbul's tumultuous past and the civilizations that tried to tame it. Explore the festive Grand Bazaar, more than 4,000 shops and two mosques spread across 60 streets! Turkish carpets tell stories of love and despair that are woven in wool and color. But before he buys one, Rudy enlists the services of a personal shopper to locate the best shops and to demonstrate the art of haggling. In addition to some of the world's great buildings Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque, and the Aya Sofia Rudy goes off the beaten path to get steamed and scrubbed in a 16th century hammam, or public bath, and visits a hookah bar! Turquoise CoastRudy's got a case of the Blues as he takes a Blue Cruise along the dazzling Turquoise Coast to discover enchanting Greek and Roman ruins. Step back in time to explore the great ancient towns of Ephesus, Antalya, Myra and Dalyan that dot the Turkish coast. Stroll Bodrum's lively waterfront promenade, and visit the Bodrum Underwater Museum to discover amazing artifacts recovered from a 14th century shipwreck. Another astounding sight is the magnificent Lycian Rock Tombs carved into the limestone cliffs. Amazements abound in this episode that gives new meaning to the words, Turkish Delight.DVD Extra FeaturesAudio Commentary with Rudy Maxa and Producer Susan McNallyExtended Music PerformancesEpisode Previews",
