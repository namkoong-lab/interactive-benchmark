        "LOG CABIN BURNER WITH 10 PCS OF BALSAM FIR INCENSE.SIZE IS 2.5\" x 3.5\" x 3/8\" diameter -- Uses balsam fir incense logs (comes with 10 pcs and we sell refills in our ebay store). Made in Maine since 1931, Paine's Balsam Fir Incense smells like the holidays—and for good reason. The company collects balsam branches from local woodsmen, then grinds, dries, and shapes those into sticks and cones that'll fill your home with the scent of evergreens, whether you have a real Christmas tree or not. And the log cabin burner couldn't be cuter. Light a stick of incense, put it inside the miniature house, and smoke will rise from the chimney. Paine's incense is made in Auburn, Maine. First, balsam branches are brought to us by local woodsmen, where they are then ground and dried. It is next pressed into incense molds and finally dried… That’s it! No chemicals are added to our incense, and is 100% natural and sustainable! We also use the balsam in our pillows. We make souvenir pillows that are stuffed with the balsam fir. They are great as gifts, or an aromatic delight in a drawer, closet, or car."
