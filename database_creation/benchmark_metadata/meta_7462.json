        "Farish A. Noor might just be Malaysia's hippest intellectual. His gifts are on full display in these expanded versions of public lectures that he delivered at The Annexe Gallery, Central Market Kuala Lumpur in 2008 and 2009. Find out how 'racial difference' became such a big deal in Malaysia, and contrast this against the way our distant ancestors lived. Discover the hidden stories of the keris, Hang Tuah and PAS. There's also quite a bit of sex. Erudite, impassioned and sometimes plain naughty,",

        ", Farish Noor successfully deconstructs conventional history -- the one that was so easily spoon-fed to those in my very own generation -- and uncovers stark truths about Malaysia's past that are little known and much less discussed. It is a painful reality that Malaysians have been manipulated through the inaccurate retelling of stories of the keris and Hang Tuah, all for the purposes of political and ethnocentric control. This book's contents should be consumed voraciously and regurgitated constantly. Then will Malaysians boldly reclaim its religious and cultural heritage, and shamelessly so, for it represents a rich myriad of mixed origins and not the monoethnic garbage we have falsely believed. Let our future be firmly grounded on a true past. --Tricia Yeoh, former director of the Centre for Public Policy Studies, Malaysia.These lectures by Malaysia's most articulate and persistent social critic lay bare some truths behind Asia's most hard-to-untangle society by deconstructing its history and cultural tales, connecting the dots from founding 15th-century hero Hang Tuah to today's ruling UMNO party. --The Wall Street JournalFarish Noor brings to bear a journalist's hunger to speak to real people and record their stories with an academic's rigour, while his status as 'the thinking woman s crumpet' means that one is never quite sure whether the women in the audience are hanging on his every word or just gazing dreamily at him.... --Jonathan Kent, former BBC Malaysia correspondent",
