        "This beautifully designed genuine 14K semi-solid Gold Medallion is carefully hand crafted and finished to perfection. At a Convent in Paris in 1830, the Virgin Mary appeared to a nun named Sister Catherine Laboure and revealed a vision of this medal. The vision showed the illuminated Virgin Mary, standing on a globe, hands outstretched with dazzling rays of light streaming.
