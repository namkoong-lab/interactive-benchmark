        "Public RecordsUltimately, access to the various records related to citizens of the United States, is determined by federal, state, county, and city governments of the United States. The federal law which controls the distribution of information controlled by the federal government of the United States is the Freedom of Information Act, which was originally signed into law by Lyndon Johnson on Independence Day in 1966. It is commonly described as a law that keeps citizens in the know in regards to their government. The United States is one of the few countries in the world that allows its citizens access to nearly all government processes and procedures that occur on a daily basis.Criminal RecordsCriminal records may be the most commonly accessible of all public records. The court systems are meticulous about recording their actions, including maintaining criminal histories on all arrested and convicted individuals. There are several types of criminal records, all of which can be accessed through the public records database. The level of detail available in the reports tends to vary quite a bit, and in some cases it may be necessary to take the information from the report, and use it to cross reference additional sources and record types.Civil and Vital RecordsCivil and vital records are records that are recorded by federal, state, county, and/or city governments. The most common civil and vital record types are birth, death, marriage, divorce, and civil court records. All of these record types are available to be searched in the member’s area. The detail of the civil and vital records information available at varies quite a bit depending on many different variables. In some cases, you may find all of the information you are looking for, while in other instances you may need to take the information that you find and use it to cross reference additional sources and record types.Liens, Judgments, and Bankruptcy RecordsLiens, judgments, and bankruptcies are part of the public record in the United States. These record types are available as a premium search through the member’s area. For obvious reasons, many people are not forthcoming about whether or not they have liens, judgments, or bankruptcies, and for other obvious reasons, it is important to know if people are being truthful with you about how they deal with debt. The member’s area provides an easy and completely discreet way of checking if a person has any liens, judgments, or bankruptcies in their past.Driving RecordsTraffic citations, misdemeanor driving convictions, and felony driving convictions are all part of the public record in the United States. Some vehicle records including license plate numbers and VIN numbers are also part of the public record. Through the member’s area, you can search by name, license plate, or VIN number in order to discover additional information. The level of detail provided in our member’s area varies quite a bit depending on many factors. In some cases, you may find all of the information that you need, and in other cases, you may need to cross reference additional sources and record types.Comprehensive ReportFull Database Access and More"
