        "This classic reserve gold label aida is a high quality cross stitch aida fabric that is up to 33-percent heavier so it can be stitched without a hoop. Made of 100-percent cotton yarn. The plastic tube packaging keeps the fabric free of folds and creases and is great for storing projects and supplies. After stitching, hand wash in lukewarm water with a mild liquid soap. Rinse in cold water. Let dry flat. Aida fabric has a precise square-patterned weave with visible stitching holes that makes this fabric easy to use and allows your needle to easily glide through the holes. Each square represents a cross stitch. Comes in 16-count. Made in USA. Available in white color. Measures 15-inch length by 18-inch width."
