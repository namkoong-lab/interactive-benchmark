        "Adopting an unconventional style bordering on the sarcastic, Hewitt offers his personal take on operators, strings, arrays, inheritance, declaring and modifying classes, documenting code with Javadoc, handling exceptions, creating GUIs with Swing, and using the system and runtime classes. \"Garage\" in the title refers to the idea of the workshop--the place where you go to tinker around with stuff, to tear it apart and build it back together again, to repair something that's not working.
