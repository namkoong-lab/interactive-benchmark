    "description": [
        "To achieve optimal results, athletes require consistent training, the proper fuel and adequate recovery. Amino acids are the building blocks of all body proteins, and branched-chain amino acids are crucial to an athlete's recovery and muscle tissue repair. Klean BCAA + PEAK ATP supplies a 2:1:1 ratio of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine, as well as 400 mg of ATP in each serving. PEAK ATP has been shown to support peak physical performance by increasing strength, power and muscle gain, allowing the body to train longer, harder and stronger. Together, these nutrients provide a direct source of energy to the muscles for performance and recovery."
