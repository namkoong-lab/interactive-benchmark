        "The trend for hyper realistic artworks featuring high shine subjects is inspiring a new generation of artists. Take your art to the next level with this collection of step-by-step techniques and tutorials for creating hyper realistic artwork. Artist and author, Amie Howard, is an expert in how to get the most from coloured pencils and she takes you through all the key techniques for rendering realistic representations of everything from pets to water.",
        "The first part of the book explores basic drawing techniques including blending, shading, glazing and scumbling - a technique used to create a slick surface texture. There are simple practise exercises for each of the techniques sections so that you can experiment and get comfortable with the different methods before trying them out on a final artwork. This section includes advice about how to get the perfect blend of colours and textures as well as tips about adding in the fine details that make all the difference.",
        "The step-by-step tutorials feature a wide range of subjects including animals, portraits, food and drink so you will learn how to recreate a large number of different surfaces and textures. The chapters are broken up into sections: Surfaces; Animals; Birds, People and Other Textures which looks at a range of different natural and synthetic textures including tree bark, grass, a soft drink can and a shiny sweet wrapper.",
        "All of the tutorials have multiple step-by-step images so you can see how the forms and textures are built up over a series of stages. Amie shares her tips and tricks for creating incredibly realistic representations of textures including feathers and fur and there are up close studies for a cat's eye, a dog's nose and a single feather so you can the details involved in these projects. Other up close studies include lips and a nose and a bird's beak and eye. The instructions will allow you tackle challenging subjects such as ripples on water and ice in glass by breaking down the drawing process into clear step-by-step instructions and photographs, allowing you to follow the artist at each step."
