        "When Emmeline was summoned to London by her brother, the Earl of Pentworth, she never expected that she would have to fight for her right to choose her own match. She quickly realizes that he is willing to sell her off to the first man who offers. She knows she has to act fast! The answer to her problems comes when she makes an elaborate plan with her brother’s closest friend to pretend to be courting. Having the future Duke interested in her will certainly make her more attractive to other potential suitors. What happens though when this unexpected friendship blossoms into something greater, possibly a match made in heaven?",
        "Lord Nash Torrington is beset by matches that his mother insists are splendid, but all he really wants is to focus on his business endeavors. However, it is obvious that his mother will not be satisfied until Nash is properly married off whether he likes it or not. When his best friend’s beguiling sister arrives in London, Nash sees a golden opportunity that might just solve both of their problems. Things don’t always go according to plan though and he finds himself surprisingly stricken with Emmeline’s wit and unique beauty. Will he be courageous enough to declare his true feelings?",
        "Waltzing across ballroom after ballroom together, Emmeline and Nash will quickly find it hard to believe their courtship is a scheme. Will they be able to make their dreams come true and marry for love?",
        "\"Dancing with an Enigmatic Duke\" is a historical romance novel of approximately 80,000 words. No cheating, no cliffhangers, and a guaranteed happily ever after.",

        "The book has resonated with readers! Here's some excerpts from their reviews:",
        "\"OMG! Talk about thin lines. A whirlwind of activities and events that keep you flipping page after page. One rollercoaster ride with a plethora of swirling emotions burst front and center. One intriguing storyline and thrilling plot bring this little gem alive flawlessly. The characters are realistic with personalities and depth that draw you in. All the non-stop action, flowing smoothly, hard hitting and suspense bringing piece after piece together brilliantly. The scenes are so vividly detailed it gives the illusion you were right there with them. Remarkable job Abigail, thanks for sharing this little gem with us.\"- K., Amazon review ★★★★★",
        "\"Abigail has written another story that pulls you in and \"reader beware\" it is hard to put it down! The characters and the storyline weave themselves into your mind - so maybe just read to the next chapter doesn't work. Emmeline and Nash (Lord Torrington) have devised a way that enables them to fill a commitment and still leaves them free from marriage or romantic involvements! What happens next is a surprise for all concerned. Another good book by Abigail Agar that is clean, full of action, and a very engaging story.\"- V. W. , Amazon review ★★★★★",
        "\"Another wonderful read by Abigail Agar. This one is about a girl named Emmeline who lives in Scotland. Her parents have passed, so her brother, who lives in England feels responsible to find her a husband. His best friend, Lord Torrington, has a mother who is being very vocal about his marrying and producing an heir. Lord Torrington comes up with the plan for Emmeline and himself to 'court' to keep them both from being bothered by their respected family members. Friendship develops and of course there are many twists and turns to keep you interested. It has wonderful characters besides our main characters. The development of the story is just so good as you keep wondering what will happen next! You will certainly enjoy this book, so go ahead and read it! You won't be sorry!!\" - K. C., Amazon review ★★★★★",
        "\"Ms. Agar certainly surprised me with this one! I always love her work but this definitely (for me at least) was her best yet. I loved the story and the different drama per character. There was a lot going on simultaneously but wow do they work together and painted a picture that amused me at times and made me feel sympathetic in some. I didn't want the story to end to be honest! Even if she did give us the option of an extended epilogue, I simply fell in love with the story that I was curious to see more of what happened to all of the characters.\"- N.
