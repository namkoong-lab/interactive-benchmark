    "description": [
        "Water NOT included 5 gallon water storage containers, 4pack (approx 20 gallons total). Portable Stackable Food-grade plastic. Included caps (1 per container, 4 total) have gaskets and 3/4 NPT knockouts for use with the included spigot (qty 1 spigot per kit). If desired, carefully remove the membrane in the center of one of the caps and install the spigot. Use this cap as needed to dispense. These are industrial grade containers used in a variety of applications. The lids are to be tightened firmly. A wrench (not included) or similar tool is typically helpful to snug and loosen the cap. Stackable three to four high per the manufacturer but we advise two or three high subject to your good judgement and safety considerations. The vent cap can be removed and the nipple pierced to improve flow in dispensing. Refer to FEMA advise on container preparation for water storage applications. New product arrives clean and in a box. There are no “BPA free” markings on the container as BPA is not used in HDPE containers. Shipping Included in the Price. Actual outbound and return shipping expenditures are not available for refund."
