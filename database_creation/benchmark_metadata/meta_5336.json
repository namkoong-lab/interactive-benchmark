    "description": [
        "ClearVision Supreme premium halogen headlamps feature high performance tungsten filaments and customized gas mixtures, combined with a proprietary optical coating. This results in a whiter and brighter light that provides superior illumination of the road with no added glare and increased depth perception and contrast which improves nighttime visibility. EiKO’s line of original equipment headlamps were designed to meet or exceed the performance of your vehicle’s original lamp. Manufactured to exacting standards results in the most consistent and reliable lamp, designed to withstand the harsh conditions today's roads dish out. Featuring top quality components, including UV block quartz glass, these lamps are guaranteed to perform like the original and engineered for lasting performance. More light on the road gives you more time to prepare, react, or avoid obstacles entirely. Additionally, each and every lamp is quality tested before it leaves the factory. The ClearVision Supreme premium halogen headlamps feature SoLux Technology that produces brighter and whiter light as well as the longest beam of any DOT legal headlamp. SoLux is a patented technology that simulates real daylight better than any other headlamp. No other lamp can do what SoLux does to improve visibility, contrast and safety while driving. Don’t forget, lamps dim over time, so make sure to replace both headlamps for best performance."
