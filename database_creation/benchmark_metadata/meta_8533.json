        "Mom's Choice Award Winner (Gold Level). \"We are happy to award deserving books like When Dog Pals Fly Across America,” said Dawn Matheson, CEO, Mom’s Choice Awards. \"Our panel of judges really felt this special book merited a place on our list of the best in family-friendly products that parents and educators can feel confident in using.” In this colorful picture book, three intelligent dog pals (Sophie the Border Collie, Sulley the Chocolate Lab Mix, and Wallace the Border Collie) embark on a flight in their personal helicopter across America with stopovers in every state visiting cool and sometimes unique places! Sophie, Sulley, and Wallace skillfully impart education, while conveying the love of flight and making new and interesting friends along their journey. The crew discusses American geography thus encouraging readers to dive deeper into what each state has to offer. The crew’s narrative and art are mind and eye-catching especially for children. An educational, self-discovery filled journey suitable for all ages. This is a first book in a series of books where Sophie, Sulley, and Wallace will fly to every country in the world! Next flight takes the crew across Japan, Canada, and more! Although this book is designed for children's age range: Ages 3-5 (preschool), ages 6-8, ages 9-12 (preteen), the book is suitable for all ages! Rob call's the book the \"adult's children's book\" due to the educational aspect of the content. The book will intrigue children with the cute illustrations of the dogs while they travel from place to place. The aviation aspect using a helicopter will also catch the attention of youngsters because there is nothing like three cartoon dogs flying a helicopter around the USA! Adults will find the book highly interesting simply due to the unique venues that the dog pals fly to. While some venues may seem familiar with adults, there are many that will raise an eyebrow and interest adults to the point that they may want to travel to the unique destination! So, enjoy the wonderful journey with Sophie, Sulley, and Wallace as they fly their colorful helicopter around our beautiful country and show off their cuteness and those sometimes unfamiliar places we have never heard of before!"
