        "Tips for using the Sculpey Tools™ Oven safe Boho Chic mold - - Oven bake clay - roll clay into a ball, press into mold, trim off excess using a clay blade. Make sure clay is flush with the top of the mold. - If air bubbles develop under the clay, gently pop them using a clay blade. Then you are ready to bake. - If you want to make multiples of the same shape simply add clay to the mold, press firmly, trim off excess then remove and add to a baking sheet. - Liquid Sculpey - Preheat the mold in oven for 15 minutes at 275 F. Remove and allow the mold to cool down until it is comfortable for you to handle, while still being warm. Fill the mold shapes with Liquid Sculpey. Use the squeegee at a 45° angle to remove excess Liquid Sculpey® and if possible return the excess back to the bottle. Tap the mold on the table to release any air bubbles. Pop the air bubbles using a needle tool or toothpick. Then you are ready to bake. Maximum Creativity - - For simple, yet cool designs try marbling two colors in the mold before baking. - To add more interest add glitter, spices or mica powder to your Liquid Sculpey before adding it to the Boho Chic mold. - Perfect for all types of crafts from jewelry making, mixed media, home decor and more!"
