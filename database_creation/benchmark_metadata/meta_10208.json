        "The third album by the Newfoundland Symphony Youth Choir, originally released in December 1999. Featuring Gordon Pinsent reading Dylan Thomas A Childs Christmas In Wales, this CD includes performances by all 4 NSYC ensembles. In a contemporary version of the traditional festival of lessons and carols, Thomas narrative is separated into defined sections, linked together by carols. CBC TV filmed an hour-long Christmas special based on the CD with the choirs and Gordon Pinsent which was broadcast in December 1999. Winner of the 2000 ECMA (East Coast Music Awards) award for Best Classical Recording."
