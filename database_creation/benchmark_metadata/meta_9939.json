        "Here I am offering Seeds from Laurus nobilis, also known as Bay Laurel, Bay Tree, Sweet Bay, Bay Leaf, and Bayleaf. This tree likes to live in sun to partial shade where it can grow to an average height of about 30 feet high. The chartreuse blossoms appear from late Spring until early Summer. Known best for being used whole in Italian pasta sauces, the leaves are also ground up and used in soups, stock, stews, and bloody Marys. It is an essential ingredient in the Bouquet Garni spice mixture. The leaves are also dried and used to make tea. The dried berries and pressed leaf oil can also be used as a spice, and the wood can be used to make a smoke flavoring. This is a larval host plant for the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, Palamedes swallowtail, and Spicebush Swallowtail butterflies. USDA Hardiness Zones 8 to 11"
