        "From the Author",
        "I have worked with children for 24 years.  They have always felt comfortable coming to me with problems.  I enjoyed counseling with them, but was heartbroken when I could not \"fix\" their problem.",
        "A Sunny Tomorrow",
        "is a collection of 19 stories, most addressing an \"unfixable\" problem faced by children.  The rest of the stories are just for fun.  Some are based on real adventures of my own children.  Others are based on my childhood memories. I would tell my First Grade students that a book is more than pages to read.  It is an adventure.  I hope the reader takes these 19 adventures and enjoys every one of them.",

        "About the Author",
        "Theresa Franklin is a Christian, wife, mother, administrator, and teacher. When asked if she could be anything in the world, what would she be, she always answers, ―I would be a teacher.‖Theresa believes that there is no thrill to equal watching a child learn a difficult concept and seeing the ‗light come on'. Even as an administrator, she taught students who came to her office for assistance.         Theresa has loved reading since the first grade and has always wanted to be an author. When she taught the first grade, the majority of class time was spent reading or writing. When she taught the fifth grade, she taught only reading--a dream job. Theresa and her husband read to their own children every night before bedtime. Theresa believes that if a child can read, he can accomplish any goal he sets for himself.         Theresa Franklin and her husband, Sam, live outside of Beaumont, Texas, where their three children grew up. She became a teacher twenty-four years ago with the goal of showing children unconditional love. Now retired from education, she enjoys writing and is the author of the children's book,",
