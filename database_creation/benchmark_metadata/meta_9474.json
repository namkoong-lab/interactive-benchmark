This book is a useful primer for geophysicists, geologists, and petroleum engineers in the oil industry who wish to expand their knowledge beyond their specialized area. It is also an excellent introductory text for a university course in petroleum geoscience.",
        "Elements of Petroleum Geology",
        "begins with an account of the physical and chemical properties of petroleum, reviewing methods of petroleum exploration and production. These methods include drilling, geophysical exploration techniques, wireline logging, and subsurface geological mapping. After describing the temperatures and pressures of the subsurface environment and the hydrodynamics of connate fluids, Selley examines the generation and migration of petroleum, reservoir rocks and trapping mechanisms, and the habit of petroleum in sedimentary basins. The book contains an account of the composition and formation of tar sands and oil shales, and concludes with a brief review of prospect risk analysis, reserve estimation, and other economic topics.",

        "Review",
        "\"...this book is extremely well written and easy to read...I would highly recommend this book as an excellent introduction to the field in university courses, to those new in petroleum industry, to nongeoscientists working with geologists, and those interested in a review of petroleum geology. I recommend Selley's text for its easy and clear text and 332 illustrations, especially for college students and those interested in concise review. This text will carry forward aspects of petroleum geology into the XXI century.\"--Marcio R. Mello, Center of Excellence of Geochemistry\"This comprehensive, stimulating book conveys information with intelligence, clear illustrations, and marvelous wit. The author writes with clarity and authority and with a grasp of the subject matter that is lightly presented.\"--Fouad Michael, Western Geophysical, Houston, Texas, THE LEADING EDGE\"...an authoritative piece of work written by an author with over 30 years experience.

        "About the Author",
        "Richard Selley is a Senior Research Fellow and Emeritus Professor of Petroleum Geology at Imperial College, London, where he has spent most of his career apart from several gap years employed by oil companies in the North Sea and abroad. He has over 50 years of experience in the teaching, research and practical application of geoscience to petroleum exploration. Richard's early research in the application of sedimentology in general and geophysical well logs in particular, to petroleum exploration has been rendered redundant by advances in seismic imaging. It is 30 years since he applied the Appalachian shale gas paradigm to Euroland and the UK. This research was ignored until recently. He has now achieved notoriety (outside the industry) as an advocate of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas and oil extraction.Richard has received various national and international honours, included the Silver Medal of the Geological Society of London, awarded for excellence in petroleum geoscience, and Honorary Membership of the Petroleum Exploration Society of GB. Richard's hobby is to research the impact of geology and climate change on viticulture; demanding research that requires considerable collateral conviviality.",

        "From the Back Cover",
        "In the fifteen years since the highly successful first edition of Elements of Petroleum Geology was written, there have been many advances in the concepts and technology of petroleum geoscience. The second edition has been extensively rewritten and updated to reflect these advances. Nonetheless it has the same objective as the first edition: to serve as an introductory text for university courses in petroleum geoscience, and as a primer for professional petroleum geoscientists and engineers who wish to expand their knowledge base beyond their own specialist area.",
