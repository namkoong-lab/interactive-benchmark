        "... and many more besides! A German Shepherd dog is characterized by its superior intelligence, high curiosity, boundless energy, versatility and regal good looks. These clever dogs can be very easy to train and can seem almost eager to learn new tricks and ways of pleasing its owner at very young ages, right up to very advanced ages.

This can happen when your training methods don't take into consideration what's important to your dog and what makes him want to obey you the most. In this best selling title from the author of The Healthy Homemade Dog Food Recipe Book, you will learn:",

        "Sam Hannigan is, and always has been, somewhat animal mad. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland with his ever expanding menagerie of purchased and rescued animals. At the last count he had 4.5 dogs of varying breeds (the 0.5 is a tiny Italian Greyhound), an indeterminate amount of cats (some are his, and some are locals that come to visit and occasionally stay for the hospitality), two ball pythons, a smattering of rats and a variety of free range chickens. He is only popular with his neighbors due to the organic eggs he shares."
