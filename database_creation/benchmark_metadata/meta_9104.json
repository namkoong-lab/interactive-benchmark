        "Crocodiles and alligators have always been one of humankind's most feared predators. Around since the days of the dinosaurs, they are probably the source of myths about ferocious serpents and man-eating dragons. All tall tales aside, these reptiles remain fascinating creatures. Did you know that crocodiles and alligators eat their food without chewing? Or that they use the sun to regulate their body temperature? Renowned science writer Seymour Simon's accessible text, and full-color photos, provide a stellar introduction to these reptile wonders.",

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Grade 3-6Simons lively text presents fascinating facts and ancient lore surrounding these intriguing animals. Readers will discover that crocodiles and alligators use their powerful tails to spin their bodies around in the water in order to rip apart their prey and will marvel at how a Nile crocodile will allow a small bird to walk through its mouth picking food from its teeth. Simon touches upon the crocodilians that lived alongside the dinosaurs and evolved into the reptiles that we know today. He also points out that despite the dangers that threaten their lives and habitats, crocodilians are making a slow comeback. Report writers may be disappointed by the absence of an index or indeed of any sort of subject division. However, the book is filled with interesting information, and the vivid, well-composed, full-color photographs and entertaining text will draw in browsers.Lisa Wu Stowe, Great Neck Library, NY Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        ", this introduction to crocodilians then discusses their habitat and relationship to dinosaurs, explains the differences between alligators and crocodiles, and supplies the basic information on life expectancy, hunting techniques, food, reproduction, endangered status, land speed, and methods of locomotion. Simon's familiar elongated format is a perfect fit for these long bodies, with each opening featuring a full-page color photograph. The narrative refers to a few of the pictures, but captions would have clarified the others. Starting with the saw-toothed snout on the cover, the striking photos will attract kids visually, and Simon's casual but clear informative approach will invite them verbally. The lack of a table of contents and index makes this book better suited for browsing than for homework assignments, but children of many ages will snap it up.",

        "Review",
        "With an unerring eye for dramatic and varied photographs of sharp-toothe d alligators and crocodiles, the respected science writer Seymour Simon guarante es our rapt attention. We learn that crocodiles do not weep \"crocodile tears,\" but that some of them do live in salt water. We discover that an alligator's te eth are hidden when it closes its mouth, but in crocodiles the teeth of the lowe r jaw can always be seen. Both can live both in the water and on land, and both have long, powerful tails. After viewing open-mouthed, scarifying close-ups of crocodilians (the generic name of alligators and crocodiles), readers will be r elieved to learn that, on land, a human being can run faster than these fearsome giant reptiles. Illegal hunting brought them near to extinction in the 1970s, but new laws have increased the population levels of most species. Besides such details, the book offers remarkable color photographs by gifted nature photogra phers. Surprising deep-green endpapers, embossed so that they look like alligato r skin, are one more feast for the eye. A Parents' Choice Recommendation. (Selm a G. Lanes, Parents' Choice, 1999) --",
