        "What Charles Rosen's celebrated book",
        "The Classical Style",
        "did for music of the Classical period, this new, much-awaited volume brilliantly does for the Romantic era. An exhilarating exploration of the musical language, forms, and styles of the Romantic period, it captures the spirit that enlivened a generation of composers and musicians, and in doing so it conveys the very sense of Romantic music. In readings uniquely informed by his performing experience, Rosen offers consistently acute and thoroughly engaging analyses of works by Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Bellini, Liszt, and Berlioz, and he presents a new view of Chopin as a master of polyphony and large-scale form. He adeptly integrates his observations on the music with reflections on the art, literature, drama, and philosophy of the time, and thus shows us the major figures of Romantic music within their intellectual and cultural context.Rosen covers a remarkably broad range of music history and considers the importance to nineteenth-century music of other cultural developments: the art of landscape, a changed approach to the sacred, the literary fragment as a Romantic art form. He sheds new light on the musical sensibilities of each composer, studies the important genres from nocturnes and songs to symphonies and operas, explains musical principles such as the relation between a musical idea and its realization in sound and the interplay between music and text, and traces the origins of musical ideas prevalent in the Romantic period. Rich with striking descriptions and telling analogies, Rosen's overview of Romantic music is an accomplishment without parallel in the literature, a consummate performance by a master pianist and music historian."

        "“Author/teacher/concert pianist Rosen delivers a monumental follow-up to his award-winning",
        "The Classical Style",
        ", here concentrating on the generation of European composers who \"came of age\" in the 1820s and 1830s: Liszt, Schumann, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and, first and foremost, Chopin...The thrust of [these] discussions is to illuminate some of the more startling and masterful changes in musical form that occurred as \"Classical\" gave way to \"Romantic\"...A valuable and important book.”",

        "“This logical and long-awaited sequel to Rosen's award-winning",
        "The Classical Style",
        "once again demonstrates the author's extraordinary insights. Rosen explains and describes the first half of the 19th century in conjunction with literature, art, and social changes...[He] also examines the lives of the composers and pursues some detailed analysis of numerous compositions to make his points. The result is a fresh, challenging, and stimulating view of the society in which Chopin, Liszt, Berlioz, and Schumann flourished. Highly recommended.”",

        "“The publisher has treated this book royally. The just-mentioned CD--seventy-five minutes of piano music in which Rosen provides sixteen audible illustrations, mostly complete pieces or movements--is one proof of this. Another appears in the literally hundreds of musical excerpts or short works printed at precisely the right point in the text. All told, the project reflects Rosen's standing as a writer whose wide readership wants to follow even his musical-technical arguments...So in both form and content Charles Rosen's latest book deserves attention from anyone who is drawn to music written in the years 1825-50 and who, more especially, wishes to explore the inner workings of masterpieces by Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt.”",

Anyone who listens to this disc will recognize not only how sensitively and thoughtfully Rosen plays this music but also how his pianistic knowledge informs his writing about it...[This is a book of] many riches, which treats a complex, seemingly unmanageable topic in a consistently provocative, engaging, and stimulating manner. There is probably no one other than Rosen who could bring to this task such a range and depth of musical and cultural knowledge.”",

University presses are not known for bargains, but this is an unusual buy from Harvard...[An] important book.”",

        "“Charles Rosen's new book is that rarity: a work of detailed musical analysis that combines profound scholarship with artistic intuition. The combination is appropriate, for, while the author is a professor of music at the University of Chicago, he is also an eminent concert pianist, to whom music is a living substance. Mr. Rosen writes thoughtfully without becoming pedantic; he engages himself personally without becoming radically subjective. When he traces connections between a composer's work, life and environment, he remains reasonable in his conclusions and does not try to be an amateur psychologist. His insights derive from the music itself. Readers who are weary of the psychosexual babble of much modern musicology will find solace...The best thing about his writing is that it leads one to want to hear the music: to listen anew to the well-known works and to acquaint oneself with the lesser known. A book like this places a responsibility on the reader, and it could serve no better purpose than to stimulate performers to think further and deeper about any music they re-create...Accompanying the book is a compact disc containing Mr. Rosen's own performance of 16 excerpts from works he discusses. The scholarship is not on show; the sensitive music making flows ebulliently, in a natural way.”",

Above all, the book underscores that Romantic composers elevated, as did Romantic poets, once trivial genres to the level of the sublime and, in so doing, defined a revolutionary approach to culture.”",

After a certain amount of random immersion in the music, one's disorganized perceptions can be usefully crystallized by short, pithy statements that put an experience into focus...Almost equally useful to the general reader are the pages where Rosen--often brilliantly--brings the findings of another discipline such as history or psychology into the discussion of music.”",

The author's ability to communicate his musical insights and immense learning has developed even beyond the capacities displayed in the earlier volume. No one else, certainly no other music historian, could have written any of the chapters in the new study, partly for the reason that its subject is the literature of the Golden Age of the keyboard, chiefly the 1830s, and Rosen himself is a world-class pianist. With incomparable lucidity and intelligence he analyzes the song cycles of Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann, the piano music of the latter and of Chopin and Liszt, in which he also instructs the performer in the subtlest particulars of playing it, and selected compositions of Mendelssohn, and Berlioz...Although no pianist can afford to be without the book, musicians of every kind should partake of both its wisdom and its practical lessons...Among non-musicians, anyone interested in the cultural and literary history of the period can feast on Rosen's introductory and incidental essays about the Romantic movement as a whole...For many musicians and all pianists, the 200 pages allotted to Chopin will prove to be the richest in discovery in the book.”",
