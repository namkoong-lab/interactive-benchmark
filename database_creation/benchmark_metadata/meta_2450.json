        "What's a guy to do when he's called by a God on the practice field to go on a wild goose chase, far to the north. Well, he goes of course. So begins the Adventures of Brull. Called to be a Warrior-Mage in an era where there are no wars, is a mean trick by the Gods. He still has to make a living, so he takes up bounty hunting. His contracts aren't the usual kind. With his gods-given Sword of Spells, he goes after magic practitioners. The Sword of Spells is a collection of episodes starting with Brull's calling and chronicles how he adapts to his new profession. One day the Gods will instruct him to do his duty, but for now, Brull will make do with what tools he has."
