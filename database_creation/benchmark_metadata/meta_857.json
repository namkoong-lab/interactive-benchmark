        "These sanding pads are comfortable to use because they are extremely flexible and conform to almost any shape. They can be used to sand deep contours or round objects as well as corners and crevices. Unlike sandpaper which has the grain directly coated onto a stiff paper backing, the sanding material on these pads is fused into the foam backing using a flexible adhesive. This gives the pad material a much longer life than regular sandpaper. The pads have a #180 aluminum oxide grit and are suitable for FINE sanding projects. They can be used on metal, wood, paint, plastic or ceramics; just about any surface where a smooth surface is required. Because of their flexible, comfortable qualities they are ideal for hobby or craft projects. Best of all, they can be used wet or dry and can be washed out and reused. This offer includes ten 4-1/2\" x 5-1/2\" pads that are 3/16\" thick. For hundreds more craft, art and hobby products be sure to visit our National Artcraft Storefront. We have the creative component you need."
