You can clean off graffiti and your graphics are protected. Unlike many other signs, our Stop - Wait Here for Gate to Open signs use industry-leading 3M inks and not off-brand or other low-durability inkjet pigments that fade in a year or two.USA's Oldest Sign ManufacturerFamily owned since 1918, we take immense pride in our signage. Being one of the oldest certainly means we know this business in and out. Our South Dakota factory is the oldest manufacturer of metal signs in the USA. We have been an integral part of safety and convenience signs have provided over the years.Signs Give a Warning - So You Don't Have ToPersonally warning people is not always the right solution. Say it with signs! Signs are the safest and the most effective medium to reach out to maximum people on your property."
