        "In the winter of 1907/1908 Josef Friedrich Schmidt went into his garage and emerged with the idea for a board game that was mass produced from 1914 on: Mensch ärgere Dich nicht! In virtually unchanged form, the game is today successfully marketed by us. Along with this classic board game, we also market a wide range of family and children’s games, soft toys, audio story books, music, films and software for children throughout Germany, elsewhere in Europe and internationally. Apart from our own children’s brands Benjamin the Elephant, Bibi Blocksberg and Bibi & Tina, our product portfolio also includes popular licensed themes such as Die Sendung mit der Maus (The Show with the Mouse), Playmobil, Thomas and Friends and more."
