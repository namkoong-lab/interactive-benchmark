        "Pandas are black and white, but that’s only the beginning of this adorable book of opposites! Whether climbing up a tree or resting down in the grass, awake or asleep, near or far, with mouths open or closed, and with their fur dirty or clean, these contrasting pairs of pandas will steal your heart in this one-of-a-kind board book.  Stunning color photography by award-winning wildlife photographer Suzi Eszterhas shows pandas in their natural habitat at three different panda nature reserves and research centers in China. Designed with simple black and white elements and with one set of opposites per spread, this is a sweet and accessible book for the earliest readers that pairs cute animal content with early learning concepts."
