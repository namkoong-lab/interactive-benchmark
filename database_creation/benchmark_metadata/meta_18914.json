How do you put your hair in a bun with a stick? Twist your hair into a coil onto of your head. Keep twisting until it coils around itself to create a bun in the centre of your scalp. Using the end piece of hair hold your bun as firm or loose as you like and hold it in place. Take one of the metal hair pins and push it through the top of the bun at 45° angle.",
