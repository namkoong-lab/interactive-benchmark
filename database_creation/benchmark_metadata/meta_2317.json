He also has no idea what to submit for a bio. So, let’s start with why Hunter decided to start writing in the first place.', 'The story begins with two best friends who grew up together, breaking rules and raising hell as they shaped each other’s personalities to become the shameless assholes they are today. Well, one of them at least, but I’ll get to that in a moment. These two boys—let’s call them Hunter and John—were all but inseparable. John excelled at creating music powerful enough to make angels weep and being the funniest asshole in Texas, while Hunter dabbled—poorly, I might add—in his humble writings. Because they were self-declared brothers from other mothers, John respected Hunter’s humble writings as much as I—I mean Hunter (stupid third-person perspective)—respected John’s musical magic. John’s tunes could have changed the world one day . . .', 'One fine day, after reading one of Hunter’s horrifically detailed short stories about a serial killer, John asked Hunter to write a story about him.', '“Hell yeah, dude! What do you want to be?” Hunter asked, brimming with honor and biting back a very manly squee.', '“A vampire,” John responded with a mischievous gleam in his eye. “But not one of those sparkly ones. A true badass!”', '“Done!” Hunter crowed, with a smile and an accompanying high five.', '“No, dude. Promise. Promise you’ll write and finish a book about me. You are the most prolific writer of our generation!” John said. (Something like that. I might be paraphrasing a little, but you get the gist of it). “I would consider it an honor to live on for eternity with your words as my life’s blood.”', 'Hunter agreed, never to realize the weight of that promise until one Sunday morning when John’s mother called, crying incoherently.', 'John . . . had died.', 'Hunter was left in a cold world without his best friend and doppelgänger. He still thinks about that moment to this day. How the morning light crept through the bedroom window while he stared at the ceiling, noticing how the popcorn texture created cruel, jagged shadows. How everything started to blur as his chest was crushed beneath the weight of what he was hearing, each word stacking heavily upon the other until only fitful, ragged gasps of air could escape his throat. Only fiery tears existed, especially after the horrific realization that Hunter now had to make some of the hardest phone calls of his life to the circle of friends who orbited around John’s solar pull.', 'Their star was no more, leaving their universe a colder and darker place.', 'John left not only Hunter but a friend named Valenta as well. There were also Nathanial and Depweg. The friends were each stricken numb with the loss of such a beloved flare of life. But . . .', 'When the three found out that Hunter was keeping his promise to write the greatest story ever told—starring their dear friend John—they demanded to be a part of the adventure. Each of them immediately knew what type of supernatural character they wanted to play in this urban fantasy eulogy. It would be a funeral pyre of words, and their fictional personas would be John’s pallbearers.', 'Fast-forward three years, and John Cook has solidified himself as one of the funniest, most human vampires in the literary world. Not only this, but he gets to live on in the theaters of readers’ minds, giving him eternal life after death.', 'As it turns out, Hunter had a knack for using words real-good-like and has expanded into a full-time author. Heck, you just read one of his works a few moments ago! So, if you enjoyed the twists, turns, and feels brought on from this book, please dive into his other ones!', '—Dictated by Hunter, holding a cigar and wearing an ascot, but not read , because I couldn’t be bothered']}"
