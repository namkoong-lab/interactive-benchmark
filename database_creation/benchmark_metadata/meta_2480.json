        "The President of the Unified Collaboration of Systems, along with hundreds of the civilians, had been ruthlessly murdered. There was little need to speculate who had done it—for the instigator was quick to take full credit for the act:The renegade Sector Command Admiral, Maros Krador.While Sector Command forces search in vain for the traitor, Krador begins to amass a fleet of warships from a secret base, setting himself on a course that is sure to leave a wake of destruction throughout the entire Beta Sector.The last team of elite covert agents sent in to eliminate Krador was never seen again, yet the Unified Council and the secretive Office of Special Investigations knew what needed to be done. They would need to try again...and there was only one agent they could trust to get the job done.Unfortunately, Angelika Jordan wanted nothing to do with it. Set several years prior to the events of the Kestrel Saga, Beta Sector is a series of stand-alone novels that chronicle adventures taking place during the Great Galactic War between the Unified Collaboration of Systems and the Kafaran Alliance in the mid-24th century."
