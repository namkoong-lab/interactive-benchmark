        "The DYNABLAST shoe is recommended for runners who want a responsive underfoot experience during their run. This running shoe comfortably wraps around the foot like a gentle hug. This design features a lightweight and breathable upper to keep feet cool without forgoing support. Additionally, the shoe's upper is made with recycled materials, while the sockliner is produced with a solution dyeing process that reduces carbon emissions and water usage. Equipped with FLYTEFOAM Blast cushioning in the midsole to generate soft landings, this material is also complemented with underfoot cutouts in the outsole to provide runners with a more responsive toe-off."
