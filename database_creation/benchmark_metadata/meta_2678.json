An avid reader (my parents tell everyone they had to move from our first home because I finished the local library), I always wanted to \"fix\" stories so the characters did what I wanted, in books, television, and the movies. Once I began writing, I found this wasn\\'t always possible, as evidenced when the mystery I intended to write rapidly became a romance.', 'However, my entry into the world of writing can be attributed to a \"mistake\" when my son mentioned the Highlander television series on a visit home. Being the \"good mother\" I began watching the show and soon connected with the world of fan fiction, first as a reader, then as a critique giver, and then, one brave weekend, I wrote my first short story.', 'Things snowballed and soon I was writing my first original novel. Much later, I mentioned something about a recent Highlander episode to my son, and he said, \"Oh, I\\'ve never actually watched the show, I just thought the concept was cool.\" Little did he know what he\\'d started.', 'I love getting into the minds of my characters, turning them loose in tight spots and seeing what they do. Too often, they surprise me.', \"My published works include the Pine Hills Police Series, the Blackthorne, Inc. covert ops series, the Triple-D Ranch series and the stand alone, What's in a Name? -- all Romantic Suspense, as well as the Mapleton Mystery series, which have been described as a blend of police procedural and cozy mysteries. Heather's Chase is a stand alone International Mystery Romance, which I had a blast researching on a trip through the British Isles. My mystery short story collection, Seeing Red, is a Silver Falchion award winner. I also have a collection of contemporary romance short stories.\", \"When I'm not writing, or watching wildlife from my window, I'm probably reading.\"]}"
