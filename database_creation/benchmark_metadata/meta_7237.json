        "An imaginative boy, his metal detector, mysterious artifacts, and a forgotten battle fill this historical novel set in Upstate New York.",
        "\"On days like this I imagine I've woken up in heaven. Squeaky brings me to the first garage sale, where there are a hundred people lined up outside. I smile at the nice lady by the garage door, and she lets me in early. Under a pile of books I find an original copy of the Declaration of Independence. Fireworks go off inside my head when I see the price tag-25¢. I pay the lady and race back home, Squeaky begging me the whole time to tell him what I bought. Mom gives me a record-breaking hug. I sell it for a million dollars, and Mom and I retire to Florida and swim in blue water with brightly colored fish.\"  Cooper and his mom run an antique business out of the old barn next to their house. Actually, Cooper does most of the work, since his mom tends to get lost in her own thoughts. He rides his bike, Squeaky, to garage sales looking for treasures, sets the resale prices, and orders the groceries. There's never much money left after he pays the electric bill, and he dreams of finding something spectacular that would make life easier--but really, he and his mom are doing okay. At least he's better at sniffing out antiques than Mr. Shepherd, the director of the historical museum, who doesn't have Cooper's knack for getting into garage sales early.  Then one day Cooper comes home with a metal detector from his garage sale hunts. He begins searching his backyard, and what he finds there sends him on a historical adventure and journey of self-discovery that will make this summer unforgettable."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 4-7-Cooper, 11, searches for treasures in his upstate New York town to sell at the antique store that he runs with his mom. Ever since his little brother, Tanner, died and his father left, his mother has been unable to do much except read books about antiques. Cooper acts as man of the house, but he still talks to his bike, his stuffed animals, and most inanimate objects. And they talk back to him. One day he uses a metal detector to explore his backyard, which abuts a state park commemorating the Battle of Newtown. He stumbles upon the battlefield itself with musket balls, cannons, and many other artifacts. Now the city wants to take over their land. He feels like his mother can't make the right decision, and he is determined that no one is going to take away his home. In the end, he realizes that the whole community is behind him and wants to preserve the history of the area as well as his home. This book is mostly description and would need a special kind of reader who is completely fascinated by this era in history or has a connection to the area. Details of the battle and the part that the Iroquois tribes played in the Revolutionary War are accurate and extensive. The characters, though, are unlikely to draw readers into the story. The end also becomes muddled since it is unclear if Cooper has supernatural talent or if the fantastical bits are all part of his imagination. An interesting look at the history of a community, but not for everyone.-Clare A. Dombrowski, Amesbury Public Library, MAα(c) Copyright 2013.

        "Review",
        "\"Narrated in the first person by Cooper, Osterweil's novel reveals the inner workings of a sensitive boy trying to figure out how to help his family survive...budding historians will have the opportunity to learn about an important moment in U.S. history--and may even be inspired to pick up a metal detector of their own.  A poignant coming-of-age story and history lesson rolled into one.\"   --Kirkus Reviews\"This beautifully written book is steeped in history and folklore all told through the eyes of an amazing eleven-year-old boy that only wants to have his mother act like a mother and the land to be free of hurt.\" --Children's Literature\"Mr. Osterweil delivers history well, with a passion for storytelling and honesty...[He] gets well inside his main character and spends some time there. [The story] comes right from Cooper's own point of view in stereophonic first-person narration that includes his secrets, his fears, and his conversations with a host of inanimate objects...[that] have internal consistency and sticking power...Cooper's point of view on things is emotional, sensitive, quirky, zany...He's at once very independent and very needy, a contradiction/combination that is certainly realistic.\" --East Hampton StarSociety of School Librarians International -- 2013 Honor Book, Language Arts-Grades K-6 Novels.\"Osterweil effectively captures Cooper's first-person point of view and the fantasy world he often slips into, where he communicates with Squeaky his bicycle, Decto his metal detector, the television, the ghost of his little brother, and even planet Earth itself. In finding musket balls, cannon, tomahawks, buttons, and coins, and learning the stories behind them, Cooper helps to preserve a piece of history.  As a result, readers will sense a healthier future for Cooper and his mother...Funny how a trip to the past can open up a new future.\"  --The Horn Book Guide",
