        "Digitally re-mastered edition of this 1975 release, the 12th album from the enigmatic singer/songwriter. Shawn Phillips has recorded 20 albums and worked with musicians including Donovan, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bernie Taupin and many others. Shawn's seminal release was Second Contribution, but Rumplestiltskin's Resolve is rated by the fans as the high point in his musical career. In the 1960's, Phillips played on several Donovan albums, performed at the Isle of Wight festival, sang on the Beatles' \"Lovely Rita\", and was cast to play the lead in the original production of Jesus Christ Superstar (he had to withdraw due to his heavy recording and touring schedule)."
