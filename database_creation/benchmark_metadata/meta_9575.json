        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "The lines by Ogden Nash--\"If called by a panther, / Don't anther\"--aptly kick off this story, narrated by a PI who maintains his comic-ironic tone even in the face of danger. Albert Samson has reluctantly decided to promote his services in TV ads that label him a \"go-for-it\" detective. Meanwhile Indianapolis newscasters scream about \"The Scum Front,\" a band of environmentalists holding the city hostage with bomb threats. On the trail of a woman who removes a bomb from its hiding place, Samson is also hired by the Scummies, and, aided by spunky artist Bobbie Lee risks life and license to help the police halt the terrorist campaign--if only the police will let him. Among the growing number of American regional mysteries, this is not a standout; otherwise well-crafted, it needs a clearer evocation of place. Lewin also wrote Late Payments.

        "From Library Journal",
        "Midwest detective Albert Samson, rather off the wall and full of acerbic comments, slides into apparent crass materialism when he stages a mystery murder for a wealthy woman's guests. Back at his office, a group of disguised women, who plant disconnected bombs for environmentalist publicity, pay him to locate a stolen bomb. No one wants anyone hurt, and Samson, not particularly macho, hates confrontation, so the plot proceeds with humor and short, jumpy paragraphs. Primarily for Samson fans.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "Albert Samson, Indianapolis's most likably raffish private eye (Out of Season, etc.), returns after a too-long sabbatical to take on two cases: tailing socialite Charlotte Vivien for her possessive, marital-minded protg, tame poet Quentin Quayle (who begins by asking Samson to vet his story about his fictional wife being murdered--a device to clear the way for the nuptials), and--more important-- locating a bomb stolen from the Scum Front, a gang of toothless environmental terrorists, before its new owners depart from Scum Front protocol by blowing it up. The cases merge in a predictable but highly satisfying way, but not before Samson sneezes in the fingerprint powder at Mrs. Vivien's murder party, goes public with a cable TV ad that brings an armed fruitcake to his office, and gets fingered as a terrorist by his old buddy Captain Jerry Miller. Despite an oddly inconclusive ending, a good time is had by all, especially smart-talking, dumb-acting Samson and his readers. --",
