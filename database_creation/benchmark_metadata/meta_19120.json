        "Replace your capacitor when it is bulging, leaking, or when there is no continuity accross the terminals",
        "When buying a capacitor: The voltage should be higher or equal but not lower to the original capacitor. The capacitance (uf, mfd) should match the original capacitor. The Hz should match the original capacitor. The terminal type should match the original capacitor. The size and shape should be considered only when the space in the application is limited."
