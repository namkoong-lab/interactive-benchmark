Gold is a metallic transition metal Gold is a soft, ductile, malleable, lustrous metal with high electrical and thermal conductivity. Gold has been used for thousands of years and predates written history. Nearly all of the gold on Earth came from meteorites that bombarded the planet over 200 million years after it formed. Gold is a noble metal. It is relatively unreactive and resists degradation by air, moisture, or acidic conditions. While acids dissolve most metals, a special mixture of acids called aqua regia is used to dissolve gold.
