        "The Devolution Trilogy",
        "I wanted to create a story where the depth and complexity of the main character, Michael Dolan, were just as compelling and important as the plot. As spy thrillers go, DEVOLUTION, EVOLUTION, and REVELATION have everything readers of the genre crave: action, suspense, cliffhangers and mystery. What makes the story so unique (and that much more captivating), however, is Dolan's dark and labyrinthine psychological struggle as he navigates the challenges of his top-secret mission while confronting the demons of his past.Visit johnjcasey.com for more information on John Casey and his writing.",
