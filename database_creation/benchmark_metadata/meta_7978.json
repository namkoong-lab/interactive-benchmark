        "From School Library Journal",
        "Gr 9 Up—A solid second volume of a postapocalyptic series. Much like Thunder (Revell, 2014), this sequel is packed with action and romance. Selah, the teenage girl who in the previous installment learned some mysteries of her past, continues on her adventures, learning more about her people and saving her friends and family from peril. Though the dialogue is sometimes stilted and the coincidences are many, the book will sweep readers along with its fast-paced plot. Teens who enjoyed the first title will gravitate to this work and will look forward to the next series entry. VERDICT Purchase where Thunder flew off the shelves and where action and adventure are popular.—Sarah Jones, Clinton-Macomb Public Library, MI",
