        "Morgan Chavez is a Class-A Empath whose gift is her curse. Due to the strength of her ability, she has excelled as a liaison officer despite dealing with constant emotional overload. Her situation makes it impossible to have a relationship, and she's been forced to give up the dream of having a family to call her own. Or so she believed...Attending the grand opening of Alpha Station: X21 near the planet Xenthian was D'Aire Ambassador Orion D'Sil's last assignment before returning home. Tired from a life of duty, Orion never thought he would find the keeper of his heart on the edge of Alliance controlled space. Morgan owns him, heart, body and soul, but can he convince her to give up everything she ever known to live with him in his world?"
