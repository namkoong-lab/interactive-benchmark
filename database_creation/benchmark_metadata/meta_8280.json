        "A perfect bedtime story, this gentle tale follows Pobble and her father as they stroll through the snowy woods near their home one evening and, in Pobble’s imaginative and unique way of looking at things, nature transforms: a winter mushroom becomes frog umbrella, a floating leaf turns into a butterfly boat, and a feather is a tickle stick. In the excitement of imagining worlds transformed, Pobble does not notice when her pink mitten falls from her pocket. Soon the woodland animals gather and begin to wonder whether the soft, pink addition to the forest is cotton candy, a mouse house, a wing warmer, or a fish coat. With luminous paintings and lyrical language, this picture book celebrates family, nature’s beauty, and the power of imaginative thinking."

        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreS-Gr 2–While out for a winter-evening walk, Pobble and her father play an inventive game. They decide that a floating leaf must be a butterfly raft and some fat mushrooms are surely frog umbrellas. Enticing duotone endpapers feature a line drawing mapping out their route. When Pobble drops her pink mitten and leaves it behind, all the forest creatures do a little inventing of their own. Squirrel believes the \"Something\" is cotton candy, Owl thinks it must be a wing warmer, and so on. The illustrations, rendered in layers of transparent watercolor glaze, are appropriately soft and gentle but don't bring out the magic and wonder of the text. Still, this clever story would be lovely for sharing one-on-one and could inspire readers to take their own imaginations for a walk.",
