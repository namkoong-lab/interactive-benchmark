        "2. What is it that amazes you-simply amazes you-about God's creation?",
        "Key Verse",
        "You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you.",
        "Nehemiah 9:6 (NIV)",
        "Bible Teaching",
        "Watch the video lesson now and take notes in your outline on pages 3-6.",
        "What You Believe about Your Origin Affects:",
        "Your _________________________________________",
        "Your _________________________________________",
        "How you __________________________ God",
        "Why Did God Create?",
        "1. God created for his _____________________________ .",
        "All things were created by him and for him.",
        "(Colossians 1:16b NIV)",
        "2. God created to express his ________________________________ .",
        "The earth is the Lord's and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.",
        "(Psalm 24:1 NIV)",
        "3. God created to reflect his __________________________________ .",
        "From the time the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see his invisible qualities-his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.",
        "(Romans 1:20 NLT)",
        "You will find the verses Kay refers to on page 53 of this DVD study guide.",
        "4. God created to show his _____________________________________ .",
        "By wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place.",
        "(Proverbs 3:19 NIV)",
        "Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.",
        "(Luke 24:45 NIV)",
        "How Did God Create?",
        "Evolution",
        "This is not a view of \"creation\" because evolution does not involve a creator. In simplest terms, the view of evolution is that life originated from natural processes, beginning with the first living substance (a single cell) and continuing with the evolving of species.",
        "It is impossible to prove _______________________________________________ any theory of origins. This is because the scientific method is based on _______________________________________ and _____________________________________________ .",
        "Evolution and creation are not just a matter of _______________________________ and ____________________________________ .",
        "The problems with the theory of evolution:",
        "1. God is ________________________________________ of creation.",
        "Darwin himself rejected the idea of adding intervention by God into the concept of evolution:",
        "I will give absolutely nothing for the theory of natural selection if it requires miraculous additions at any one stage of descent.",
        "2. The probability of evolution by _______________________________________ .",
        "It requires an incredible amount of faith to believe that evolution could have caused by chance all life that ever did or does now exist. - Charles C. Ryrie",
        "The current scenario of the origin of life is about as likely as the assemblage of a 747 by a tornado whirling through a junkyard. - Fred Hoyle",
        "3. The lack of evidence for __________________________ evolution.",
        "Charles Darwin concedes this lack of evidence in his writings:",
        "Not one change of species into another is on record ... we cannot prove that a single species has been changed.",
        "The Bible tells us that God made each animal \"after its kind.\" This is easily verified not only by the fossil record by also by modern scientific observation and experimentation. Animal breeders have successfully created new breeds of animals but have never changed one species into another.",
        "We are now about 120 years after Darwin, and knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. Ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of Darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information. - David Raup",
        "4. The irreducible __________________________ of living things.",
        "By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.... An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. - Michael J. Behe",
        "Discovery Questions",
        "1. One of the statements at the beginning of this study was, \"What you believe about your origin affects your self-worth, your relationships, and how you view God.\" In what ways do you feel that your view of God as our Creator impacts your daily thoughts about yourself and this world?",
        "2. How do you feel about the statement, \"God created for his own sake?\" How would you answer someone who says it would have been selfish of God to create for his own sake?",
        "3. Where do you see God's wisdom? With your group, make a list of ways creation shows the wisdom of God.",
        "Did You Get It?",
        "How has this week's study helped you see the significance of God's choice to create?",
        "Share with Someone:",
        "Think of a person you can encourage with the truth you learned in this session. Write their name in the space below and pray for God to provide that opportunity this week.",
        "Prayer Direction",
        "Take some time as a group to talk about your specific prayer requests and to pray for one another.",
        "LIVING ON PURPOSE",
        "Worship",
        "The Bible is filled with verses that tell us creation is an expression of God's character. To look more deeply into this, take some time before the next session to read the following verses and record your thoughts. Consider sharing one meaningful thought with the group at the next session. Nehemiah 9:5-6 Psalm 8:1, 3 Psalm 19:1-4 Psalm 104:24 Psalm 104:30-32 Isaiah 43:7 Isaiah 51:12-13, 16 Amos 4:13 Romans 1:20 2 Corinthians 4:6",
