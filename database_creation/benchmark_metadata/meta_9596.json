        "From the Author",
        "My first aspiration was to become a nun. I was five. A strange career goal for a Jewish kid. However, Isaac Asimov's books changed my outlook: A space psychologist sounded much better than a nun. I am a Psychologist, but I reach the stars only in my fantasies. So, let's embark on the Phoenix - with Joy, CU62 and others, and enjoy an incredible voyage into the future - toward Mars. Dr. M. Tzuk will tell our story. But when we land we will remember that in all of us travelers, the human spirit is revealed in its finest, even as disaster brings us crashing into the cliffs of the universe."
