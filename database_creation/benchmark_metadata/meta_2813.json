        "\"Reading it made me want to learn more about the conflicts the American Indian endured over the years.\"\"Well written. Interesting without being overly simplified or complicated.\"\"This is an important document to put into perspective the history most would like to forget: it must be incorporated into our memory and remain frontal in subjects we must accept and never allow happening again.\"\"This book is eloquent. It should be required reading.\""
