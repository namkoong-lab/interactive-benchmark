        "Issued on July 1, 1994 in Stockbridge, MA., this Souvenir Sheet of four 50 cent stamps honor Norman Rockwell centennial of his birth. On January 6, 1941, as World War II raged in Europe, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed Congress. He submitted that any settlement reached after the war should be based upon \"four freedoms\": freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Norman Rockwell created four paintings, each titled after one of the freedoms, that visually idealize the concepts of Roosevelt's speech. More than one million people saw the paintings on a 16-city tour to promote war-bonds. The tour was a tremendous success, and over 30 million was raised for the cause. Rockwell's \"Triple Self-Portrait\" is a wonderful example of the good-natured humor found throughout much of his work."
