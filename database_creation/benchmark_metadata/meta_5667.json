        "This lightweight, yet rock-solid box-side access step employs a rugged die-cast aluminum alloy linkage assembly that is crafted in the USA. Black anodized and PTFE powder-coated for maximum corrosion protection. Precision, stainless-steel hinge points and press-fit bushings ensure trouble-free action and reliable, maintenance-free operation for decades. Die-cast-aluminum alloy linkage components and precision-machined pivot points give BedStep2 rock-solid stability. The ridged, non-slip step is molded of strong glass-reinforced resin, for safe footing even in mud, snow or ice. Mounts just behind the cab, forward of the rear wheel, providing a faster, easier and safer route to access toolboxes, equipment and cargo in the bed. Easily installed, this frame-mounted, retractable truck step can be mounted on either side of the truck box, and it flips down or retracts with just the nudge of your foot."
