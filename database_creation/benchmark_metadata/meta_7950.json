        "From School Library Journal",
        "PreSchool-Grade 2–Little Mouse asks his relatives about the magic of Christmas, and they all have different explanations, depending on their particular perspective. 'It's sitting indoors,' says Grandpa, 'where the fire will thaw your cold toes.' 'It's stringing the tree lights,' says Daddy, 'that twinkle and glow through the night.' Told in undistinguished rhymes and sweetly illustrated with an abundance of glitter, this book is more appropriate as a gift purchase for adults looking for a sentimental, secular holiday title than for most collections.",
