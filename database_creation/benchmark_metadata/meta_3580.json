        "Cool gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Dual layers gel infused, ventilated memory foam surface + high density foam base for excellent support for a medium feel. High density foam has a compression rate of 44lbs. It features the perfect amount of cushioning and stiffness. Its soft but still holds its firmness and support for an individual to sit on it without compressing the foam too much. Compression = firmness compression (not density) is what determines firmness. If you don’t want a cushion that’s hard as a rock or a mattress that sinks when you sit on it, you have to check the compression or ild number.  Do not open with a box cutter. Use a ball point pen or a pencil. Start by making a little incision and break it from there - durability : will last 7 to 10 years. It has high quality compression and material to keep it lasting for longer periods of time even when harsh weight is applied. 50% restocking fee may apply."
