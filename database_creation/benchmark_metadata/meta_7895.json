Throughout my 9 year career as an ESL teacher, I've found that great materials are much more rewarding when you can share them with others. So it's only natural that I created an ESL resources website to help teachers and started publishing books for ESL teachers and learners. I hope that the books I have created save you some time and make your life a little bit easier.\"]}"
