        "Some things are worth more than money...",
        "North Carolina artist Gwendolyn Marsh is on a New Mexico mission. She's got ten days to raise twenty thousand dollars in cash. In financial straits herself and hoping to help her sister, Gwen's determined to bring monetary relief fast. What Gwen doesn't bank on is getting the utterly handsome and irresistible Dan Holbrook in the bargain. Still recovering from a failed first marriage, Gwen's not sure she'll ever love again. Can a midnight ride in the desert convince her to change her mind? Billionaire bachelor Dan Holbrook is an outdoorsy man who knows how to behave in polite company. So when his sister Nancy asks him to run her Santa Fe gallery while she's away, Dan thinks he'll have no trouble manning the store. That is, until Ms. Gwendolyn Marsh blows into town like a wild, west wind, upending his world with her womanly ways. Dan's heart hasn't healed from its last disaster. Can he risk opening himself up to hurt a second time?SANTA FE FORTUNE...He moved nearer now, his mouth just inches away. \"I'll be damned if I don't want to kiss you,\" he said, his voice a husky rasp. And she'd be damned if she didn't want him to. \"Dan...\" she said, tilting up her chin and closing her eyes.\"But I won't,\" he said, snapping her back to attention, eyes open. \"Not now. Not here. Not like this...\"She started to speak as he brought his fingers to her lips. \"If ever I've seen a woman who deserves to be kissed well, it's you. But the timing has got to be right. You have to be sure.\" He cast a cursory glance at her wedding band and backed away. \"I need to be sure. Something tells me we've both gone down a path neither of us wants to travel again...\"",
        "A sweet, PG-rated romantic comedy."
