I love writing murder mysteries in which plucky heroines solve the crime. Whether it’s the 1880s or the 1920s, these ladies must rely on their wits – no detailed forensics or technology to help them out!', 'The Penny Green series follows the ups, downs and investigations of Victorian news reporter Penny Green. As one of the first lady news reporters on Fleet Street, she has her work cut out.', 'The Churchill and Pemberley cozy mystery series features senior sleuthing duo Annabel Churchill and Doris Pemberley. With a combined age of 140 and a penchant for cake and slapstick mishaps, they somehow manage to outwit the local village constabulary.', 'The protagonist in my newest series is Augusta Peel, a bookish and reluctant sleuth with a mysterious past. What secrets could she be hiding?', 'All my mysteries are clean, light and fun to read. Some include fascinating historical detail too. I hope you enjoy them!', 'You can find out more at emilyorgan.com.']}"
