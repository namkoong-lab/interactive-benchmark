        "Dr. Mabuse--criminal genius, psychologist, hypnotist, counterfeiter, card shark, master of disguise, thief of state secrets and ruler of a sinister empire founded on selfishness, chicanery and murder--gained his first screen incarnation in this monumental film by Fritz Lang, one of cinema's greatest directors. Made in 1922 and subtitled \"A Picture of Our Time,\" \"Dr. Mabuse, The Gambler\" is indeed a snapshot of a historical moment when Germany was likened to Sodom and Gomorrah. Now, both parts of Fritz Lang's memorable silent film--\"Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler\" and \"Dr. Mabuse, King of Crime\"--are now available on one package."
