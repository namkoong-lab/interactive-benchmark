After making a list, wouldn't you want to hop over your fence and set off on a walkabout (that's what Australians call a walking tour)? Packing her notebook, pen and anything else she might need conveniently in her pouch, one foggy night, Willow hops over the fence and begins her mission to see as many of the interesting and fun places in the city as she can over the next several days.

I was never much for kids' stories when I was a kid or when I had two of my own. But I love this book, a true Boston TOUR de force. -- Jim Braude, 96.9FM and New England Cable NewsWillow's Walkabout is a charming, fanciful story that is a wonderful introduction to the Boston area for children. As someone who worked with Aardu, the curious wallaby who inspired this book, I know firsthand how incredible the journey was. Children are sure to embrace this book detailing Willow's adventures, and I hope it encourages everyone to visit all the fabulous animals at Stone Zoo and Franklin Park Zoo. -- John Linehan, curator of mammals at the time of Aardu's adventure, and currently president and CEO of Zoo New England (Franklin Park Zoo and Stone Zoo)\"'Make Way for Ducklings' will have to make way for Willow.

A proud native of Scranton, PA, Sheila experienced love at first sight when she arrives in Boston to attend graduate school. A lawyer, and now author, she is a devoted fan of all things Boston",
