        "Ben Bova, president of the National Space Society and author of many books and articles about science and space, offers a unique combination of scientific fact, space research, and far-reaching imagination to show why humankind should, can, and will return to the Moon. A base on the Moon is both practical and economically sensible. Bova explains how pharmaceutical, plastic, metal, and electronics products can be manufactured more efficiently in the Moon’s high-vacuum, low-gravity environment and shows how the Moon’s abundant raw materials – aluminum, metal ores, and oxygen – make it possible and profitable to supply Moon-based factories from lunar mines. This is a fascinating reading experience that brings the future to life – and will change the way you look at the Moon."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "With the premise that man returns to the moon in 1999 and establishes a permanent base there by 2020, science fiction author and editor Bova here fashions an intriguing \"manual\" for pioneers arriving at the lunar community. With 50 detailed illustrations by NASA artist Rawlings, the guidebook covers Moonbase history, architecture, ecology, transportation, science projects, jobs, training, industries, tourism, sports (\"lunar jai alai\"), entertainment, day-to-day life, duties, rights and laws: \"No one is allowed to walk on the surface alone, except in the specially marked 'Moonwalk Lanes.' \" Combining fact and fiction in this \"future history,\" Bova presents a compelling and persuasive argument for mankind's continual exploration of the moon and the establishment of a base on the lunar surface.
