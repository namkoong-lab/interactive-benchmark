        "\"Chasing Eden",
        "is the story of one brave woman's uncharted path to becoming as she paws gently, humbly, persistently through the suffocating darkness of a multitude of trash bags to tear through the illusion of plastic flesh into the light of the truth which she'd always possessed, despite the intrusion of unwelcome doubts, along with a redemptive, elephant memory and finally learns to trust the persistent voice within. Okay, maybe a smidge of credit goes to Jesus, cool neighbors, one amazing teacher, hope chests, nature, goats, the motivational force of misery and Amy Grant. Her music will never sound the same. Instead of 8th grade dances, I'll hear the salve for my sister from another mister's soul.\"I breathed a tearful sigh of relief as I turned the last page which won't mean a thing unless you read every line, suffer every humiliating sting of the beastly, insecure, cowardly! Persuader, every brutal Winter that comes before the final, first and merciful Spring.\"Today, while speeding through too many chores against fading daylight, I envisioned belting Ignorance as if it were some disembodied being; some person we could all be allowed to viscerally hurt and hate. I wanted to take out my rage for her pain on someone. Our higher self knows there's no such or single human person to punish; it's simply the roots of divinity meeting at the intersection of Providence and Hell. This enlightened understanding weaves itself throughout Cherilyn's story. She gets it. While we're allowed to loathe and protect ourselves against the fear-filled, pond scum of humanity, we're invited to understand, as Cherilyn does, that love and free will are our only hope.\"",

        "Chasing Eden",
        "is just such a book: a memoir about a young woman growing up in a family controlled by a father who constantly moved his family around in search of the ideal, Edenic place in which to wait out the End Times - hence the title. Along the way, a few things got neglected, like giving the four kids any stability, security, regular meals, electricity and running water, a social life with kids their own age, a sense of community and--most painful for the eldest child Cherie, the author of this book--any formal education.\"As is sadly all too common among off-the-grid, survivalist, often religious-extremist families who pull their kids out of the \"corrupting\" influence of public (and sometimes even Christian) schools, Cherie and her siblings were told to tell people they were being homeschooled. But there were no homeschooling texts (and precious few books at all, it seems) in their home, no curriculum was followed nor was even the most rudimentary attempt made to teach the kids anything except some housekeeping and manual-labour skills. The fact that Cherie not only managed to eventually get a GED but became the articulate, thoughtful writer of this engaging and compelling memoir must be almost a literal miracle when you realize how huge the gaps in her education were.\"",
