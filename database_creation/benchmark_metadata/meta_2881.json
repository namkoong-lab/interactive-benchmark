        "Each of my stories portray settings that seem as though they may have really happened, but could not possibly be so. Each and every concept is straight out of my head, and figments of my imagination. None of the content is real, even if I wanted or willed it to be. All of it is pure fantasy, as much as it would be nice that any of it is real. It is my strongest hope that I draw you in to imagine along with me for a while."

        "POSTEDBY RED CITY REVIEWProfessional Literary Book ReviewShort Pathways in a Room of Imagination by JohnNeedham is a collection of mind-bending short stories that start offin our seemingly normal real world, only to quickly turn off the deepend into situations that could only occur in a make-believe place ofthe most wondering imagination. The fifteen stories contained withinthis book have a wide range of different narratives, from 'The OldLady' to 'A Knock on the Door' to the final story 'Church ofthe Modern Apostles.' The stories stand alone, and each can beenjoyed one at a time, but the themes and narrative styles presentcompliment each other nicely.Mostly all of the stories are told in the firstperson, placing the reader right within the imagined tale that istaking place. As Needham describes in the book's introduction,these stories were written with a purpose, to broaden the reader'simagination and cause them to delve into each of these short storiesfully. He requests each story to be looked upon individually, fullyimmersing yourself into each of the tales he has spun. The charactersrange from all sorts of different people, but each one is fullydeveloped and makes the story he or she is entwined within matter,affecting the reader in an intrinsic way. Needham excels at the shortnarrative, although from the vast amount of content imagined withineach tale, it is likely that he would succeed at writing afull-length novel as well. If you are looking to get lost for a whilein stories that twist reality and offer up notions to ponder, thenthis is the book for you."

A good way to get to know me is to read what I have written when you will discover a very vivid imagination. I think better on paper than on my feet, but not by much. I don't have an accent on paper, whereas my south of Boston, Massachusetts, where I was born, raised, raised my own and educated comes across in my proudly displayed accent...an accent that disappears on paper, astonishingly. I live in St Petersburg, Florida, but identify myself as Mrfallreev of Fall River, Mass. You can take the man out of the city, but can't take the city out of the man.\", 'Right now I am working on two things at once. One is on my website at www.johnneedham.org. Here I am working on another compilation of short stories I would classify as Science Fiction Fantasy. Most of my stories are little too real, and hard to discern if any of it, if not all of it is possible or real. I am posting a good deal of the actual stories that will be included in this book right on the website just for the kick of it, and to see if people might find themselves not being able to get enough...maybe even addicted?', \"The second project is now complete. It is a full novel in the same genre as my short stories, a full story that is something I always wanted to say, but never had the courage to - until now. It is in the edit and format stage, with a reveal after I dot all my I's and cross all my T's. The name of the piece is: THE NEW WORLD SOCIETY. A cover has already been crafted for the book.\"]}"
