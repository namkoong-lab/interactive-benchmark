        "In this important high-school-level course, Dr. Michael Farris, founder and chancellor of Patrick Henry College and with the Alliance Defending Freedom, brings the U.S. Constitution to life for modern Americans by examining these questions: What does the Constitution actually say? What does it mean? What were the Founders’ intentions for this document? And how is it being interpreted to shape our laws and way of life today? This may be the most important course your student (and future voter) takes this year."
