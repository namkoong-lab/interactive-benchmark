        "Zipper Compression Socks",
        "Graduated Compression Socks perfect for relieving swollen ankles and feet. They even help relieve symptoms of varicose veins and excess fluid retention. Graduated Compression in each pair of compression socks helps to improve blood circulation to keep legs feeling energized. Compression socks are the very tightest around the ankle and gradually become less tight towards the knee. This design causes an increase amount of blood to return to the heart and less blood to pool in the feet. This helps in many ways but one of the most noticeable is less swelling in the feet. Compression socks increase circulation, increase oxygen delivery, prevent cramps, and help fight muscle fatigue. These compression socks are designed to do just that. Compression socks keep legs and feet healthy, happy and energized. Compression socks soothe and massage achy legs and feet, higher compression, and softer fibers than the others. Compression socks support circulation to reduce swelling and relieve symptoms of varicose veins.",
