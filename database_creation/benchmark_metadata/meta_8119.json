        "With 19 chapters organized into five units, BUILDING A SPEECH, 8th EDITION guides students through the step-by-step process of developing public speaking skills through observation, peer criticism, personal experience and instructor guidance. Readings and exercises help students draft informative and persuasive speeches and improves their research and speechwriting skills. Topics such as apprehension and listening help students realize that they are not alone in their struggle to find the confidence to speak in public. BUILDING A SPEECH is grounded in the philosophy that students can master the steps of speech construction when provided with a caring environment, clear direction, and creative examples. Plus, this new Eighth Edition of BUILDING A SPEECH -- a Cengage Advantage Book -- continues the tradition of providing proven texts at lower prices."
