    "features": [
        "Having played host to more than 60 Hollywood productions--from the early years of cinema through the 1970s--Sedona, Arizona's impact on the film industry is revealed here for the first time. Detailing its role as a silent but stunning backdrop to all types of movies, this volume covers the silent films, B westerns, World War II propaganda, and film noirs filmed on location in Arizona. Lavishly illustrated, this reference tells the story behind an anti-American Nazi propaganda western; the true history of filmmaking in Monument Valley; the first-ever inclusive guide to the location filming of Stagecoach; and descriptions of each Arizona production from conception through reception by critics and audiences, with plot summaries and complete details of cast and crew. 2011 finalist for the Western Writers of America Spur Award for Best Western Nonfiction Contemporary literature."
