        "From the Inside Flap",
        "In the world of Isa Fae, magic is both life source and currency, and running out of magic means certain death. But beyond barter, the only way to obtain more magic is by collecting energy from other dimensions...an option that hasn't been available to them since a nuclear war rendered Earth uninhabitable, cutting off the Fae's primary source.With the stores of magic dwindling, and no access to the human world to get more, the Fae must find new ways to distribute magic and protect what little they have. But when the factions can't agree on how to move forward and secede from one another, it leaves each to be represented by their own leaders and ruled by their own laws.What lengths will each faction be willing to go to survive? And what price will survivors from Earth pay to be a part of their new world?Publisher: Fallen Sorcery",
