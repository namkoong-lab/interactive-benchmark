        "Narumi Fujishima has never fit in with his classmates. Joining the gardening club didn't make him Mr. Popularity, as there was only one other member… but when he's introduced to a reclusive girl who lives above the ramen shop, Narumi's whole life changes radically.",
        "That's because while Alice may be a NEET (someone who is Not Employed, being Educated or in Training,) that doesn't mean that she does nothing all day. Quite the contrary. Besides collecting stuffed bears, Alice is an expert hacker and runs a secret detective service utilizing the talents of her other NEET acquaintances! To his surprise, and great personal peril, Narumi quickly finds himself drafted into this strange, elite team, and now his life is anything but boring as the NEETs take on a deadly new drug hitting the streets!",
