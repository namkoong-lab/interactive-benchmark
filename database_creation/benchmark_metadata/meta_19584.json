        "Love and greed collide in Connecticut's tobacco-rich Million dollar mile. Troy Donahue is \"Parrish\" and has the title role in this starry saga of life in the verdant Tobacco Valley. Parrish enters this Million Dollar Mile with only his name and his ambitions. He'll need little else traveling a rocky road to maturity and success. En route he'll have the support of his mother (Claudette Colbert) in her last big-screen role), the devoted love of a farm girl (Connie Stevens), the counsel of a savvy grower (Dean Jagger) and confrontation with ruthless tycoon Judd Raike (Karl Malden.) Raike may control the valley - but he may not be able to stop an iron-willed youth on the move."
