        "Review",
        "Thinking Like a Scientist",
        "is a very handy guide that is extremely well written and truly addresses key components (at a middle-grades level) of how scientists do their work. And although the target audience is advanced fifth graders, the lessons could easily be used or slightly tweaked to use at any middle school grade level. I recommend this book for all middle-grade science teachers.,Laura Von Staden,MiddleWeb, 9/12/19",
