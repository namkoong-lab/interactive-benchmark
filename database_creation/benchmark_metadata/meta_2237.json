        "Book Description",
        "Multithreaded applications execute multiple threads in a single processor environment, allowing developers achieve concurrency. This book will teach you the finer points of multithreading and concurrency concepts and how to apply them efficiently in C .",
        "Divided into three modules, we start with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. We then take an in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions.",
        "In the next module, you will learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C since the 2011 revision, synchronization and communication between threads, debugging concurrent C applications, and the best programming practices in C .",
        "In the final module, you will learn about atomic operations before moving on to apply concurrency to distributed and GPGPU-based processing. The comprehensive coverage of essential multithreading concepts means you will be able to efficiently apply multithreading concepts while coding in C .",

        "About the Author",
        "Maya Posch",
        "is a software engineer by trade and a self-professed electronics, robotics, and AI nut, running her own software development company, Nyanko, with her good friend, Trevor Purdy, where she works on various game development projects and some non-game projects. Apart from this, she does various freelance jobs for companies around the globe. You can visit her LinkedIn profile for more work-related details.",
        "Aside from writing software, she likes to play with equations and write novels, such as her awesome reimagining of the story of the Nintendo classic, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and the survival-horror novel she recently started, Viral Desire. You can check out her Scribd profile for a full listing of her writings.",
        "Maya is also interested in biochemistry, robotics, and reverse-engineering of the human body. To know more about her, visit her blog, Artificial Human. If there's anything she doesn't lack, it has to be sheer ambition, it seems.",
