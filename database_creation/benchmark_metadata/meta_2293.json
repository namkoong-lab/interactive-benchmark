        "From the Inside Flap",
        "The core of this story is true.  It was told to me thirty-five years ago.  Since then, I knew that one day I would tell it to the world.This is a unique story that began just before the Second World War in Europe.  It is the story of a young Jewish married couple with a baby who get separated as a result of the war.The young woman assumes a new identity in a concentration camp, falls in love with a German military official, and starts a new life.Her husband struggles with life, reunites with their young daughter, and tries to deal with the supposed loss of his wife.This is a story of their gripping survival, and most of all, their separation and \"Parallel Lives\" thereafter.The novel takes the reader through the political differences of several countries, emotional struggles, and love.  The book demonstrates cowardice, selfishness, heroism, and patriotism.  It describes how war could affect families for generations.That era is very familiar to me.I too, have lived through it.--Lena Rotmensz",
