        "About the Author",
        "Robin Yonash moved to Kings Hill, about 5 miles southwest of Iowa Hill, in 1949 with her grandparents, Frank and Esther Yonash. She rode a horse to attend the Iowa Hill School from September 1950 through October 1956, when she transferred to Foresthill, where she graduated as the Salutatorian in June 1957. After graduating as Valedictorian from high school at Mt. St. Mary's in Grass Valley in 1961 (a boarding school at that time), she went on to receive a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of California, Davis in 1965. Following a successful career in the computer field, Robin retired in 1998 and moved back to her beloved Sierra Nevada foothills-but not all the way to Iowa Hill. Having become addicted to electricity and telephones, she compromised on the Colfax area. However, she still considers Iowa Hill to be her home town and is involved with the community, serving on the Board of the Iowa Hill Community Cemetery, developing an updated transcription of the Cemetery, writing this book and the preceding one, and attending the occasional Taco Night. She is now working on Volume 3 of this series, Gold and Fire: A History of the Iowa Hill Divide, planned for publication in late 2016. Although she was born in Pasadena, Robin Yonash considers Iowa Hill in Placer County, California to be her home town. She grew up there in the 1950's, riding her horse five miles each way to elementary school every day. After graduating as Valedictorian from high school at Mt. St. Mary's in Grass Valley in 1961 (a boarding school at that time), she went on to receive a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of California, Davis. Following a successful career in the computer field, Robin retired in 1998 and moved back to her beloved Sierra Nevada foothills-but not all the way to Iowa Hill. Having become addicted to electricity and telephones, she compromised on the Colfax area where she has become a local historian. Her books include \"History of the Weimar Joint Sanatorium and the Weimar Cemetery,\" and a three-volume history of the Iowa Hill Divide. The first volume, \"Schools of the Iowa Hill Divide,\" is now in its second edition. The next book, \"Towns and People of the Iowa Hill Divide,\" is coming in April 2016 while the final volume, \"Gold and Fire: A History of the Iowa Hill Divide,\" is planned for publication in late 2016. In addition to her books, Robin serves on the Board of the Iowa Hill Community Cemetery."
