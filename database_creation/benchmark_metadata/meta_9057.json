        "A tale about language, love, and identity, A Larger Sense of Harvey takes a bold stand between the traditions of American metafiction and the European epic. Set in the Greek islands, Helsinki, Minsk, and even a research facility in Lapland, the novel chronicles the life of the self-styled typer, divorcee, and impenitent (if impotent) observer Harvey Rocketsch. Beginning with his postwar boyhood outside Minsk, to his tenure documenting covert language research at a secret lab in the Arctic, the novel reveals the mystery behind Harveys death in a freak ballooning accident over the Dvina River.",
        "Though the novel is presented as a compilation of Harveys private journals, the question of translationparticularly botched translationlooms large as it becomes clear that Harveys personal accounts have been skewed by his friend, mentor, and colleague Martin Ambrose. Eventually Ambroses translations are pit against the authentic story which is revealed despite his attempts to suppress it. The result is a narrative laced with both hilarious and gently philosophical moments as Anastasopoulos goes on to consider the nature of sex, language, and male friendship."

        "Review",
        "\"A Larger Sense\" is an eccentric high-dive into language...concerned with divergences between source and translation; experience and memory. --",
        "Rain Taxi, Winter 2001/2002",
        "\"A Larger Sense...\" is a challenging, multilayered novel, structurally and thematically. Anastasopoulos, a talented writer, possesses a fertile imagination. --",
        "The Review of Contemporary Fiction, October 2001",
        "Breathes fresh life and perspective into the existential novel...An ambitious engaging tour-de-force...It should someday become a classic. --",
        "American Book Review, January-February 2003",
        "From the Publisher",
        "Advanced praise from Paul West in Master Class, Harcourt Brace July 2001: \"Anastasopoulos excels at parallel writing. His novel fascinates as it amasses not so much action as the verbal history of his plot, which he celebrates by recalling its other plots (Minsk while roaming Helsinki) allowing all visible cities to become in part invisible. He alters everything as he goes...making the cities more real by relating them to some intellectual mainstream: the aliens, the word experts, the erotic worrier.\"",
        "From the Inside Flap",
        "This edition of A Larger Sense of Harvey begins with two chapters that were missing from the original published in 1992. The author, Harvey Rocketsch, wrote the chapters at a villa in Paros, Greece several months before his death in a ballooning accident over his native Belarus. For several years, the entire world assumed the early chapters were forever lost with the balloon at the bottom of the Dvina River. But luckily, the British tourist who discovered the chapters behind the bidet of a public toilet in Corfu, happened to be an avid reader of Londoner Magazine (the first journal to publish portions of the book). She instantly recognized the nature of her discovery. The opening chapters add to the record new revelations about the infamous “langoo-adj” plot to break down Indo-European language barriers. They provide a new gloss on the research team, their friendships and hatreds, the true tensions which sabotaged their dangerous work. Indeed, were it not for the tourist’s discovery, this second edition would never have made it to print.",
