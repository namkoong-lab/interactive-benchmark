        "Renee Blare's been buried in a book for as long as she can remember. Raised in Louisiana and Wyoming, she started writing in poetry in junior high school and that, as they say, was that. After having her son, a desire to attend pharmacy school sent her small family to the awesome town of Laramie. She's been counting pills ever since. While writing's her first love, well, after the Lord and her husband, she also likes to fish and hunt as well as pick away on her classical guitar.Nestled against the Black Hills with her husband, crazy old dog, and ornery cat, she serves the community of northeastern Wyoming as a pharmacist and pens her Christian stories, keeping them interesting with action and intrigue, of course. She loves to interact with readers and invites you to check out her website, blog, and social media.Links:Website: reneeblare.comFacebook: facebook.com/ReneeBlareAuthorTwitter: twitter.com/ReneeBlareGroup Blog: pinterest.com/reneeblare/Goodreads: goddreads.com/Renee-BTumblr: reneeblare.tumblr.com/LinkedIN: https/linkedin.com/pub/renee-blare/4/44a/3a0Google+: plus.google.com/u/0/b/115997793075103886566/115997793075103886566",
