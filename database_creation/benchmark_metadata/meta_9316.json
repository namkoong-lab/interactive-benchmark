        "There will be scouts that participate in scouting primarily because Scouting is fun, so offering an active game period at every scout meeting is critical to bringing boys back week after week. Coming up with stimulating game ideas is not always easy, though. Some units have limited space in their meeting halls, or need games for very small or very large numbers of youth. The Scout Games book is designed to help Scoutmasters deliver meeting fun regardless of the challenges any unit may face. This includes: active games; traditional games; indoor games; outdoor games; games suited for youth of varied ages; heights and weights; games for large groups; and games for small groups. There are many options to help solve the diverse problems a leader might face. Even games designed to reinforce Scouting skills like knot tying and first aid are included. Some of these games originated with Baden Powell and are time tested, while other games are more contemporary. They are all Scout tested and guaranteed to deliver fun. Games are rated with between one and five stars. Five-star games are the best and most fun, while one-star games are less fun but are still enjoyable. We hope that you enjoy this collection of scout games and that they help you deliver an outstanding program."
