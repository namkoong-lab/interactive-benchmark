Because some customers experience a drying of their skin when using this soap, start with one application and then gradually work-up to daily application. You may increase to two or three times daily if needed or as directed by a doctor. If bothersome dryness or peeling occurs, reduce application to once a day or every other day. You may follow cleansing with the natural moisturizer of your choosing.",
