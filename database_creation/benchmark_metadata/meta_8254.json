        "Elizabeth Burns crafts a stunning debut novel, filled with luminous, wryly humorous and wrenchingly honest prose.",
        "As a successful young urbanite, Bridget Fox experiences the typical joys and struggles of youthful New Yorkers, and she has happy expectations for her new family. But when her daughter Maeve is diagnosed with autism, Bridgets life as she knew it and her idealistic images of the perfect family are shattered. She tries to lean on her husband, her father, her best friend, but none can help her reconstruct her world as other tragic challenges begin to surface. But as she tries to choose between insanity and oblivion, Bridget discovers that matters are not nearly so simpleor so hopelessas she once believed.",
        "Elizabeth Burns weaves the beauty and imagery of her poetic voice into a story of pain, humor, struggle and ultimate redemption. Bravely intimate, astonishing in its honesty, Tilt walks a path that most \"normal\" novels fear to tread as it follows the journey of a woman desperate enough to falland strong enough to survive."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "The things that happen to Bridget Fox in this debut novel could make Job weep, but Bridget is funny on every page, and equally poignant. The overwhelming fact of Bridget's life is that her five-year-old daughter, Maeve, is autistic. Bridget describes what it's like to love a child when \"she can't let you know she loves you back.\" Maeve wears a weighted vest to calm her and alternately giggles and moans to herself. She throws herself against a window and cracks it. This child would be too much for anyone, but Bridget has also suffered grievous losses: she divorced her philandering first husband and weathered the death of her beloved cousin. She and her current husband, Pierce, recently left their longtime home in Manhattan for Minneapolis, where Pierce, an internationally known sculptor, has a teaching job. Bridget has virtually no support system. Her father dies of cancer, her mother is chilly (she tells the desperate Bridget that she needs to find a good rinse for her graying hair). Pierce is soon diagnosed as manic-depressive. It's no wonder that Bridget tilts toward mental breakdown, but it is a wonder that she can be so engaging while coming unhinged-and that Burns manages to stave off melodrama with her dry wit and down-to-earth narration. Burns is a poet whose prose is lyrical, energetic and original. \"We have crossed over into some world that I used to imagine was inhabited only by saints and martyrs, by mothers who grow patience like lizards grow tails.\" This hip and witty novel doesn't mince words about sex, mental illness or the exhaustion of child-rearing.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "Burns' first novel tracks Bridget Fox's transformation from carefree, sophisticated New Yorker to depressed Minneapolis wife and mother. Hired as an English tutor by a Portuguese family, Bridget meets talented sculptor Pierce Keller. After a whirlwind courtship, they marry, have two children, and move to Minnesota, where Pierce has landed a job as a college art instructor. In rapid succession, Bridget loses both her best friend and her father to cancer and learns that her oldest child is autistic and her husband is manic-depressive. Bridget then attempts to commit suicide and is hospitalized with severe depression. Two elements keep this novel from dissolving into a complete pity party-- Burns' witty narrator, who proves to be a delightfully amusing guide through this seemingly endless tour of travail, and her memorable portrait of the autistic Maeve, whose behavior is maddening, mysterious, and fascinating. In fact, the too-few scenes between mother and daughter are riveting because they are rendered with such bracing candor.",
