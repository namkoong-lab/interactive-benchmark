Dystopia, apocalypse, gene-splicing, cloning and colonization are explored here by new authors and combined with proto-sci-fi and speculative writing of an older tradition (by W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin R. Delany, Sutton E. Griggs, Pauline Hopkins and Edward Johnson) whose first-hand experience of slavery and denial created their living dystopia.With a foreword by Alex Award-winning novelist",

        "\"With topics ranging from slavery to space travel, the impressive breadth of this anthology makes for a well-rounded survey. Readers, writers, and scholars alike will find great value here.\" -- Publishers Weekly Starred Review\"Both wonderful and important [...] this book is nothing less than a powerful argument for Black science fiction to be recognized, to be seen, and to be appreciated on its own terms. \" -- Lightspeed Magazine\"An excellent mix of adventure and excitement. Some of them are in the creepy-Lovecraftian style, others are terrifying glimpses into the future. A great collection to dip in and out of.\" -- Terence Eden’s Blog\"This comprehensive, powerful volume elevates marginalized voices of the genre, and is an excellent start for readers looking to diversify their reading material.\" -- Booklist\"[...] the anthology contains a thrilling group of memorable, moving tales that often examine the intersections of race, gender, grief, tech and the fantastical.\" -- Scientific American\"These tales incorporate sci-fi, dystopian, and oftentimes futuristic tales that intersect identity, technology, space, and time. While fictional, these are still great reads on the Black experience with a mix between century-old classics and more modern tales.\" -- Reviewed\"The latest installment of Flame Tree Press’s “Gothic Fantasy” series has something for every speculative fiction taste.\" -- Library Journal",
