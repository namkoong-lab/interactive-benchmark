        "A time of great darkness plagues the mythological world of Nunc; a darkness not seen since the beginning of time. Dark lords, demons and ruthless men scour the Continent of Opots searching for seven men who have no knowledge of their destinies. Seven men written about in ancient prophesies; men who could change the tide of time. The twelve kingdoms of Opots are in turmoil as wars rage and thrones are betrayed. Family secrets long hidden in the darkness surface to challenge the kings of three of the most powerful kingdoms."

Her parents moved to Madison WI within the following three years. Sandra attended Herbert Schenk Grade School, La Follette High School and the University of Wisconsin all in Madison. Sandra earned a Bachelor’s of Arts Degree in Journalism and later obtained an Associate’s Degree in Police Science at the Madison Area Technical College. She joined the United States Army Reserves in 1974 and retired in 2002.', 'Sandra wrote her first book at the age of eight and in her words, “I was not a child prodigy. The book was awful.” But the desire to write burned within her for decades. Sandra had story lines and characters running wild in her mind for years but it wasn’t until she was undergoing cancer treatments that she took the time to write down the stories that filled her imagination.', '“Writing was an interesting journey for me,” stated Sandra. “I am a very organized person and initially tried to make the stories follow detailed outlines. This method of writing just did not work for me because the stories lacked life. Then one night as I sat before the computer, I can’t really explain it well but it was like my ego took a back seat in my mind and the characters came forward. I found myself using a very different method for writing and not only did I enjoy the writing more but the stories came alive.”', 'Sandra returned to work but a year later had another cancer related surgery that developed complications. These complications forced her to retire from the Dane County Sheriff’s Office in 2013 after 23 years of service. Once Sandra retired she worked preparing her many manuscripts for publication.', '“I’ve had a number of people ask me if my characters represent specific people. All of my characters are composites of people I have encountered in my travels and life experiences. Until I started writing I didn’t realize how rich my life has been,” said Sandra.', 'Sandra started writing books of poetry then transitioned to novels. All of her books are available on Amazon.com.', 'I write about warriors; men and women who rise above the rest. Men and women who overcome their fears with courage and integrity. While some of my characters may seem like super heroes, the real life men and women who risk their lives every day to protect and to serve us are truly super heroes. Please support your warriors. There are a variety of worthwhile organizations that need financial support and/or volunteers. Visit a hospital, send a card, say a prayer.', 'Full color maps are available for download on my website.', 'Website: www.sandrajyearman.com', 'Business Email Acct: sandrajyearman@ gmail.com', 'Twitter Acct: @sandrayearman', 'FB Fan Page: Sandra J Yearman/Seraphim Publishing']}"
