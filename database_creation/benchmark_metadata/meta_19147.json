This grinder includes an extra-large high grade stainless steel tray (2.5\"x13\"x21\") that's easy to clean, will endure years of tough use and will save you time besides preventing waste due to reduced product transfer.",

Its large mouth allows for an easy feed while still preventing any accidents. The provided stomper must be used at all times for safety.",
