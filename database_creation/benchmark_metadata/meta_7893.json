        "There’s simply nothing more versatile than knitted shawls. They can be lacy or chunky, bright or neutral, cabled or just plain garter stitch, but they are always stylish, useful, and perfect for when you need a little extra warmth. Laura Strutt has designed 35 beautiful shawls and wraps, with something for everyone, from novice knitters to experts. Divided into Bright and Beautiful, Warm and Rich, and Neutral and Natural shades, the patterns use a complete rainbow of colors, including variegated yarns. The stitch patterns are just as diverse, with textured triangles, beaded lace stitches, and overlapping “waves”. Start with a beautifully warm garter stitch wrap in a cool glacier blue—quick to knit even for a beginner—or a rainbow-striped triangular shawl. Then try a fashionable ombré-shaded shawl with an eyelet pattern, or a gray and white monochrome shawl with a bright contrast edging. For more experienced knitters, there are larger projects such as the brioche-stitch shawl, or the feather and fan stitch afghan in a variegated silk-based yarn. Whether you are knitting a cover-up for yourself, or a gift for a friend or family, you will be spoilt for choice with these beautiful designs."
