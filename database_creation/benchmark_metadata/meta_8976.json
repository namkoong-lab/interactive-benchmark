        "About the Author",
        "David Hatcher Childress, known as the real-life Indiana Jones to the many fans of his books, is a captivating speaker and the author or coauthor of over 25 books. He has traveled the world several times over, seeking adventure and the answers to the mysteries of mankind's past. Born in France in 1957 and raised in the mountains of Colorado and Montana, David's curiosity about the world was piqued at a young age. He attended the University of Montana where his studies in oriental culture and philosophy led him to a job teaching English in Taiwan. In 1976, David left the United States on what would become a six-year research and adventure odyssey. During this time, he studied first-hand the ancient civilizations of Africa, the Middle East and China, sometimes journeying into dangerous territory along the way (like Uganda during the overthrow of Idi Amin). After more than 40 years of investigating these arcane subjects, David finds his unique views and ideas gaining popularity. He is currently a co-star on the History Channel show Ancient Aliens. This popular show is now in its eleventh season and David journeys to Peru, Bolivia and Mexico for episodes of the show. He has appeared on Fox-TV's Sightings and Encounters, two NBC-TV specials, The Conspiracy Zone, and segments for the Discovery Channel, A&E, the Sci-Fi Channel, the Disney Channel, The Travel Channel and others. David also appeared on the Canadian television show Weird or What?, hosted by William Shatner, in its 2011-2012 season. He is also a frequent guest on nationally syndicated radio shows. He continues to explore, write and excite people about discovery through his magazine, World Explorer, and his publishing company, Adventures Unlimited Press. When not traveling, he divides his time between his homes in Illinois and Arizona. He has bookstores open to the public in both locations."
