        "“The NIV Application Commentary series doesn’t fool around: It gets right down to business, bringing this ancient and powerful Word of God into the present so that it can be heard and delivered with all the freshness of a new day, with all the immediacy of a friend’s embrace.” -- Eugene Peterson“This series promises to become an indispensable tool for every pastor and teacher who seeks to make the Bible’s timeless message speak to this generation.” -- Billy Graham“It takes more than interpretation of God's Word to change lives, it takes application. Application is the bottom line in preaching and teaching. Without it, we’ve missed the point of the Bible. The NIV Application Commentary is an outstanding resource for pastors and anyone else who is serious about developing ‘doers of the Word.’” -- Rick Warren, Pastor, Saddleback Valley Community Church“The NIV Application Commentary series promises to be of great service to all who preach and teach the Word of God.” -- J. I. Packer, Regent College“At a time when many pastors are deeply in need of inspiration and encouragement, these volumes… would be a good investment for congregations, even if it means adding a line to the annual budget.” -- Christianity Today“The NIV Application Commentary builds bridges that make the Bible come alive with meaning for contemporary life--and the series do so concisely, clearly, and accurately. No wasted words or academic detours--just solid help and practical truth.” -- Warren W. Weirsbe“The NIV Application Commentary series helps pastors and other Bible teachers with one of the most neglected elements of good preaching---accurate, useful application. Most commentaries tell you a few things that are helpful and much that you do not need to know. By dealing with the original meaning and contemporary significance of each passage, the NIV Application Commentary series promises to be helpful all the way around.” -- Dr. James Montgomery Boice, Tenth Presbyterian Church“It is encouraging to find a commentary that is not only biblically trustworthy but also contemporary in its application. The NIV Application Commentary series will prove to be a helpful tool in the pastor’s sermon preparation. I use it and recommend it.” -- Charles F. Stanley, Pastor, First Baptist Church of Atlanta“The NIV Application Commentary meets the urgent need for an exhaustive and authoritative commentary based on the New International Version. This series will soon be found in libraries and studies throughout the entire evangelical community.” -- Dr. James Kennedy, PhD, Senior Minister, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church“The NIV Application Commentary series will be a great help for readers who want to understand what the Bible means, how it applies, and what they should do in response.” -- Stuart Briscoe, Pastor, Elmbrook Church“The NIV Application Commentary is a magnificent gift to the church!” -- Dr. R. Kent Hughes, Pastor, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois“If you want to avoid hanging applicational elephants from interpretational threads, then the NIV Application Commentary is for you! This series excels at both original meaning and contemporary significance. I support it one hundred percent.” -- Howard G. Hendricks, Dallas Theological Seminary“This is the pulpit commentary for the 21st Century” -- George K. Brushaber, President, Bethel College & Seminary“The NIV Application Commentary dares to go where few scholars have gone before---into the real world of biblical application faced by pastor and teachers every day. This is everything a good commentary series should be.” -- Leith Anderson, Pastor, Wooddale Church“Here at last is a commentary which is not only academically well informed but which helps that commentary reader hear God’s Word and consider its implications; scholarship in service of the Church.” -- Arthur Rowe, Spurgeon’s College",

        "Reading Joshua can be, frankly, a jarring experience. Serious, troubling questions about God's attitude toward his created peoples arise, questions with no easy answer. But the book of Joshua presents itself, warts (and wars!) and all, and asks readers to let it tell its story from its point of view and out of its ancient context. It asks them to give it the benefit of the doubt and permit it to speak to them. This commentary aims to give its voice a clear hearing --- to translate its ancient cultural form in such a way that it freely speaks about the life of faith today. Basically, the book of Joshua tells how biblical Israel navigated a major historical transition early in its national life. The book shows that guiding these changes is Israel's God, Yahweh, through his chosen servant, Joshua. The introductory sections to follow set the scene for entering the book of Joshua and the ancient world about which it reports. Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. They focus on the original meaning of the passage but don't discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable --- but the job is only half done! The NIV Application Commentary Series helps bring both halves of the interpretive task together. This unique, award-winning series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into our present-day context. Joshua helps readers learn how the message of Joshua can have the same powerful impact today that it did when it was first written.",
