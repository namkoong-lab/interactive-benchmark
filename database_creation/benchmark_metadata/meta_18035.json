        "Unfair Lures is a burning desire to put a 'better mouse trap' in your hands. As a veteran Fly Angler with 516 species on 3 Continents, Paul has developed his skills as a distance caster, Fly-tyer and out of the box 'Fisho'. Matching the hatch has always been his passion. It's all down to accuracy."
