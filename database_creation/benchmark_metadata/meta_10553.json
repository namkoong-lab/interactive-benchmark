        "KIDS MUSIC FOR GROWN-UPS Like many great accomplishments and lessons in life, MUSICAL STEW began because of a perfect combination of chance and enthusiasm. It was in Medford, Oregon, 2004, right as \"The Puppet Movement\" was gaining momentum. Many puppets felt as though they were merely being used for entertainment, and were searching for more meaning to their lives. During one peaceful demonstration, several puppets were snatched up and placed in Time Out in a small treehouse in the old-growth forest. This is where our two young, innovative puppets first met. One day in Time Out, Macho Nacho and his new friend Mouth Trumpet began chatting about their frustrations. Mouth Trumpet, though a very talented musician, shared with Macho Nacho that he sometimes had troubles in school focusing on the lessons he was taught. \"Yeah, Man,\" agreed Macho Nacho. \"School is really important. But, sometimes the things you need to learn in life aren't always explained in school.\" \"Stuff like, why do we need to share?\" said Mouth Trumpet. \"And why don't people always wear diapers?\" Macho Nacho added. \"No one ever helped me know why I get scared of the dark!\" declared Mouth Trumpet. \"Oh yeah, man! Or why we need to take our medicine, even when it tastes gross?!\" Macho Nacho and Mouth Trumpet talked for hours about the things they wished someone had helped them learn when they were younger. They discovered too, that Time Out was a good thing. It allowed them some quiet time to think and they began to write songs about these lessons. They converted their treehouse to a home for their new band, and MUSICAL STEW was born. They decided they wanted to help others and tackle these and many other questions and lessons using positive reinforcement through music. The songs of MUSICAL STEW communicate life lessons, school lessons, and everyday lessons while forming bonds with those we love. In an upwardly mobile society such as the one we live in now, sometimes we don't get to see our loved ones as often as we would like. This great music conveys and strengthens the messages parents teach to their children, and is something grown-ups will actually WANT to listen to 400 times."
