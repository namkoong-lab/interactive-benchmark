        "Regan Reilly glanced out the window of the plane she'd been on for the last fivehours, thrilled to finally spot the skyline of Manhattan. It's great to be back,she thought. This is where I belong. For a lot of reasons. Not the least ofwhich was her new beau ? the head of the Major Case Squad in New York City ?one Jack Reilly, who thank God was no relation.",
        "A private investigator in Los Angeles, thirty-one-year-old Regan was planning toattend the crime convention that her mother, mystery writer Nora Regan Reilly,had organized with a handful of her fellow authors. Regan's father, Luke, theowner of three funeral homes in New Jersey, would be there too. It was atChristmastime, when her father had been kidnapped, that Regan had met JackReilly. They'd been involved in a coast-to-coast romance for three months.",
        "\"I'd do anything that would result in your happiness, Regan,\" Luke had joked ?more than once since he was safely home ? \"even be kidnapped.\"",
        "Yes, Jack makes me happy, Regan mused as the wheels of the plane smoothly hitthe pavement and the pilot taxied to the gate with no delays.",
        "At the baggage claim Regan was inordinately pleased that for once her suitcaseswere among the first to be spit down the chute. She hoisted them onto the cartshe'd rented and hurried out to grab a cab. There was only one person on thetaxi line. This is all so easy today, Regan thought. Too easy. Something's gotto go wrong. But even though it was after five o'clock on a Thursday, her cabmade great time getting into the city.",
        "As they passed the Plaza Hotel and headed across Central Park South, Regansmiled. Almost there, she thought. She'd be joining her parents at theconvention's opening cocktail party and then for dinner. Jack had an awardsceremony he had to attend out on Long Island, but she'd see him tomorrow.",
        "Life was a regular bowl of cherries.",
        "At her parents' apartment, Regan felt the familiar sense of comfort that shealways experienced when she walked through the door. She quickly showered,changed into a black dress, the nighttime uniform in the city, and hurried out.The cocktail party was still in full swing. Nora spotted Regan the minute shearrived, her maternal instinct on its usual red alert.",
        "\"Regan, you're here!\" Nora exclaimed happily as she hurried over to greet heronly child.",
        "Several hours later, Regan, Nora, and Luke were finishing a festive dinner atthe Gramercy Tavern. All the tables were filled, and the bar was bustling.",
        "\"That was delicious,\" Regan said as she looked around the busy restaurant. \"Thisis the perfect place to kick off the weekend. I don't get down to thisneighborhood enough.\"",
        "Little did she know that, less than two blocks away, a crime was taking place. Acrime that would bring her back to Gramercy Park much sooner than she expected.",
        "* * *",
        "Nat Pemrod sat at the antique desk in the living room of his splendid penthouseapartment and sighed happily. A few feet away, the door to his safe was open,and all its contents were spread out lovingly in front of him. With a hint ofmist in his eyes, he gazed down at his deceased wife, Wendy's, engagement andwedding rings; the pearls he had given her on their first anniversary; the sillylittle ring they'd gotten out of a Cracker Jack box that Wendy had alwaystreasured even more than her real jewelry. All the bracelets and earrings andnecklaces and pins he had bought her over the years were here. Each and everybauble and trinket, cheap or expensive, held a special memory.",
        "Nat had been a jeweler for fifty years. A few days ago, he and his buddy andfellow jeweler Ben had decided to donate the proceeds from the sale of fourprecious diamonds they'd owned secretly for almost half a century to theirailing Settlers' Club in honor of its one hundredth anniversary.",
        "They'd both been \"Settlers\" since their early thirties, and Nat had been inresidence at the club for most of his life. The club, founded by an eccentricfor \"pioneering people with spirit,\" and located on beautiful Gramercy Park inNew York City, had in its heyday been a favored gathering place for social,political, and artistic leaders, a mecca for cultural events. Its membership of\"pioneers\" had consisted of men and women with a broad range of occupations andpersonalities, and included a fair share of oddballs. But now the club wassuffering the fate of many similar clubs and was in danger of closing.Membership was down, the place was in disrepair, and funds were low. It wassneeringly referred to by some as the \"Settled Down Club.\"",
        "With the anniversary party coming up, Nat and Ben had decided they should puttheir money where their hearts were, so to speak, sell their diamonds, and forkover what would amount to four million dollars to the club.",
        "\"It should certainly help get this joint jumping again.\" Nat chuckled.",
        "Nat had also decided it was high time to make some final decisions about whowould get Wendy's jewelry. When he was gone, he wanted the baubles to beappreciated. But while he was alive he couldn't bear the thought of Wendy'sjewels adorning another woman's body. He conducted his private, loving inventoryand was about to put the jewelry back in the safe when once again his eyes fellon the special red-velvet jewelry case.",
        "Nat's hands trembled slightly as he reached for it. Cradling the case in hisoutstretched palms, he opened it carefully and stared at the four large andbrilliant diamonds that in a matter of days would be turned into cold, hardcash. \"I hate to say good-bye to you guys after fifty years of togetherness, butthis club of ours really needs the dough.\" Nat laughed and placed the box backdown on the desk.",
        "A surge of excitement coursed through his veins, and he clapped his hands. Thisis going to be fun, he thought. Helping this club fix itself up. The big onehundredth anniversary party on Saturday night. More parties to celebratethroughout the year. Ben and I will be at the helm of it all. It sure brightensup a dreary March.",
        "The raw wind outside suddenly seemed to penetrate the apartment. Nat pulled hisbathrobe closer and looked around at his living room appreciatively. Theglorious wood paneling, the antique furniture, the wrought iron staircase thatled up to a balcony with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, the tops of whichoverlooked the couch, the fireplace, and the pair of life-sized sheep that wereperched in front of the window.",
        "Nat and Wendy had bought them early in their marriage because they reminded herof her childhood days on a sheep farm in England. Over the years, Nat hadsurprised her with any sheep knickknacks he could get his hands on. But the twostuffed sheep were her favorites. They were the children she never had. Sheloved them so much that when she made a generous donation to the Settlers' Clubright before she died three years ago, it was with the understanding that whenshe and Nat were both dead, the club would take those sheep and put them in aplace of honor in the front parlor.",
        "Yes indeed, this has been a wonderful place to live for more than fifty years,Nat thought. Ben and I made the right decision to be such generous souls andmake sure it keeps going!",
        "He jumped up, grabbed the red box, and walked over to the sheep, whom he andWendy had named Dolly and Bah-Bah. He pulled the two glass stones out of Dolly'seye sockets and replaced them with two of the diamonds. He then repeated theprocedure on Bah-Bah, stood back, and smiled.",
        "\"The eyes have it!\" He laughed. \"You two look like a million bucks. Your mama,Wendy, loved it when you slept with the diamonds in your eyes. She said you wereher precious jewels. This is one of the last nights your eyes will have thatspecial sparkle.\"",
        "Carefully, Nat pulled the strands of wool that were their bangs over their nowvaluable eyes and patted them both. He dropped the glass stones into the red boxand replaced it on the desk.",
        "I'll take my shower and then close up shop here, he thought with a smile. Heshuffled down the long hallway and through his bedroom. In the opulent marblemaster bathroom, Nat turned on the jets in the shower full force.",
        "\"That'll feel good on these old bones,\" he muttered as he walked past theoversize Jacuzzi and back into his bedroom, closing the bathroom door behindhim. \"Warm it up a little in there first,\" he said.",
        "The ten o'clock news would just be starting. He lay down on his bed, grabbed theremote control, and flicked on the television. What a day, he thought, chucklinghappily. Making plans to give away several million bucks can really tire youout. Nat closed his eyes for what he thought would be a moment but quickly dozedoff. When he awoke with a start, the clock on the bedside table read 10:38.",
        "Nat pulled his eighty-three-year-old body up and slid down off the old-fashionedfour-poster bed that his dear wife had purchased three decades ago at a mostserendipitous garage sale. As he pushed open the bathroom door, a wall of steamenveloped him. \"Ahhhhhh,\" he grunted as he took off his bathrobe and hung it ona hook.",
        "But something was wrong. He peered through the steam and stepped toward theJacuzzi. It was filled with water. \"What?\" he said aloud as fear clutched hisheart. \"I didn't turn this on...did I?\"",
        "\"No, you didn't.\"",
        "Startled, Nat spun around. He started to speak, but before the words came out,an intruder emerged from the steam and gave Nat a forceful shove that sent himhurtling backward into the Jacuzzi. Nat's head banged against the side of thetub before it slid below the surface of the water.",
        "\"Perfect.\" The intruder watched as Nat's body settled into a nearly motionlessstate, swaying ever so gently with the movement of the slowly calming water.\"It's a shame how many people lose their lives when they slip in the tub. Acrying shame.\"",
        "A moment later, the shower jets were turned off and the inside of the stall hadbeen wiped dry.",
