        "'These stories by the Master are an introduction to living a spiritual life pleasing to the Creator of all humankind. Gleaned from the written record of stories told over a period of many years, they provide life changing perceptions of spiritual realities that often escape the modern mind. Stories hold the key to unlocking the human heart by revealing the eternal verities that can remove the barriers blinding one's spiritual insight and hearing, and they create a taste for spiritual things in one's soul, a taste that leads one to explore the great wealth of the spiritual world. Let the reader reflect and meditate on these matchless gems of wisdom and discover the love of God enshrined therein.' Jack E. McCants"

        "Review",
        "'Dr Badiei's delightful collection of stories told by 'Abdu'l-Bahá is a timely addition to the wealth of materials on the ministry of One Who was characterized by His father, Bahá'u'lláh, as the perfect Exemplar of His Faith. In the context of the Iranian culture (or the Middle East, for that matter), stories are used to make a point: moral, philosophical or spiritual. And no one ever better used the medium for those purposes than the Master. For the reader it is a joy to have them available in one volume. Such stories should not be neglected or lost by the passage of time. We are grateful that Dr Badiei has rendered the Cause such a service, a service that to him also has been a labour of love.' --Nosratollah Rassekh, Portland, Oregon"
