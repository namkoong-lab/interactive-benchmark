        "Stickin' it to the Matrix is this generation's version of Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book. Funny and irreverent, the book is a practical step-by-step guide to both escaping and extracting from the Babylon system matrix. In Stickin’ it to the Matrix, Henderson offers the reader the same insights that allowed him to \"retire\" at age 28, move to the country and author this, his 4th book."
