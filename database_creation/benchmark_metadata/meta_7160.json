        "There are few animals that are as lovable as a dog, and few dogs that are as lovable as a Lab. A first-class retriever with a loyal personality, gentle nature, and good looks to boot, Labs are faithful companions and assistants that bring us laughter, comfort, and courage.",
        "Love of Labs is the ultimate tribute to these remarkable dogs, with captivating stories by leading outdoors writers complemented by delightful color photos. Stories like Bill Tarrant's \"Of Miracle and Memories,\" which evokes the beauty of the relationship between an owner and his Lab as the owner faces the impending death of his longtime friend. Or James Herriot's tale of the lovable but awkward Lab, Brandy, whose classic Labrador antics will make you laugh.",
        "No other book pays higher honor to the Lab than Love of Labs--it's sure to become a favorite of dog lovers nationwide.",
        "Also recommended: Love of Goldens, Puppy Love."
