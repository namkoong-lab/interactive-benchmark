        "\"A Book For Women\"-Sue Julsen",
        "Fabulosity Is You! is a book written for women of any age. This is a useful guide for building confidence while pursuing your own purpose in life. You will find helpful tips for fashion, weight loss, and skin care. The author even includes some of her own natural recipes in skin care to bring out the \"glow\" using facial scrubs and masks. By following the tips in this book any woman can learn how to be \"sexy\" by enhancing their natural beauty. She also touches on love and heartache, and how to have a happy, fulfilling relationship/marriage, never losing the pursuit of being \"you.\" Winsome Campbell-Green's Chapter Nine says it all: NOTHING IS AS SEXY AS A WOMAN WITH CONFIDENCE! I highly recommend this book to all girls/women of any age!",
