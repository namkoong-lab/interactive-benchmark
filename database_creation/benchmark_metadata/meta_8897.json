        "\"★★★★★ Bravo!!! Now that is how you write a finale to a book series!\"\"★★★★★ Crossover is undeniably the best book in the Back to Normal series. It transports you into the lives of each character and forces you to feel a range of emotions. As the story unfolds, the suspense is gripping and you will not be able to put it down.\"\"★★★★★ Amazing book overall, and as a series, one of my favorite I've ever read. Back To Normal has kept me hooked for this whole past year...\"\"★★★★★ Crossover is an engrossing read. As the last installment in the Back to Normal series, the breadcrumbs that McWilson meticulously planted throughout the first three books all culminate in surprising and often shocking fashion.\"\"★★★★★ An incredible end to a spectacular book! Twists, turns and 'ah-ha' moments make this one of the best suspense sci fi books I've ever read!\"\"★★★★★ Brilliant wrap-up of an amazing series! Well worth the read, especially when each book in the series is better than the one before. Highly recommended!\"",
