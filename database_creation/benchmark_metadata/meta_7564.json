        "Launching her new Loregiver fantasy series, this role-playing walkabout leaves Christian's earlier Mainline setting for a Tolkien-derivative northern universe devoid of any flights into convincing Faerie. Adolescent-angst-filled farm boy Dalin suddenly finds himself alone when a mysterious band of invaders hurls his master, Truthsayer Grannar, from his icy aerie and makes off with the Truthsayer's cloak of office. Dalin follows the band onto a treacherous slope only to be ambushed and left to die by Hanno, a renegade runemaster who plots to steal the cloak from his erstwhile allies. Conveniently saved by a high-ranking elf and the Guardian of the Thorn, who are themselves in pursuit of the garment, Dalin flounders from one predictable scrape to another, until at last he learns to master his innate magical powers. Christian calls up all the usual Old Norse paraphernalia--shape-shifters, selkies, dwarfs, runestones, dragonship. But her story line miscarries, for its characters lack depth and the questing often seems pointless. Though pleasant enough for a little harmless escapism, this excursion into high fantasy is a pedestrian one. Agent, Chris Lottis. (Dec.) Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "From Library Journal",
        "When raiders murder Granmar the Truthsayer and steal his magical robe of office, young Dalin of Nevi--Granmar's apprentice--sets out on a perilous journey to recover the robe and avenge his master. Christian's (Mainline) use of alternating chapters to follow the progress of Dalin and his quarry provides a close look at the motivations and personalities of both the hero and his adversaries. An abundance of magic, from elemental sorcery and runic spellcasting to priestly healing and nature summonings, adds variety to this series opener set in a world flavored with images from Norse and Icelandic mythology. A good choice for most fantasy collections. Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.",
        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "The kick-off of a new fantasy series set in the same world as, but otherwise unrelated to, Kar Kalim (1997). Apprentice Dalin lives with his grand-uncle Granmar, the Truthsayer, high in a cave at Crystal Spires. Then, intruders hurl old Granmar off the cliff and seize his robe of office. Dalin stealthily follows them, but Hanno, the raiders' runemaster, magically blinds and binds him. Finally he's rescued by warrior Arandel, one of a second party (largely indistinguishable from each other and from the first party) arriving to find out why the Truthsayer hasn't visited recently. Arandel and friends agree to help Dalin pursue the malefactors and recover the robe, or Tapestry. Thereafter, an inordinately complicated plot emerges piecemeal. Hanno, scheming to become the king's chief advisor, arranged to dispose of Granmar (he could expose lies despite Hanno's rune-magic) and plans to double-cross his associates. Dalin finds he can commune with trees and rocks, turn into a bear, and unerringly detect falsehoods. Arandel and company need to assemble the Panoply of the Loregiver (the Tapestry, a cup, and a brazier) to prevent wars in their homeland. But when Dalin confronts Hanno and appeals to King Hammankarl, Hanno easily befuddles the king with his magicand Dalin ends up in a dungeon. Hardworking, with intriguing magics, but pedestrian and poorly thought out. It's becoming ever more difficult to recollect Christian's promising SF debut, Mainline (1996). --",
