        "An American safecracker named Zed (Eric Stoltz) is summoned to Paris by his childhood buddy, Eric (Jean-Hugues Anglade). Eric has the perfect, no fail robbery plan for Zed. We go in, we get what we want, we come out. But in life nothing's perfect.",
        "Dreams of easy money quickly evaporate when the heist starts to go wrong and Eric transforms into a psychotic, drug crazed sociopath! As the robbery spins out of control, the death toll mounts. The next victim is the bank secretary, the trouble is, she's Zoe, and Zed's in love with her. He has a second to decide what side he is on....",
        "This highly controversial debut by Academy Award winning filmmaker Roger Avary was an instant classic and fast became the barometer by which Generation X gauged it's own nihilism. A stylish tour de force that remains a must own dark vision that drags exploitation, kicking and screaming into the realm of art house cinema!",
