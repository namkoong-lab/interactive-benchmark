Reflective accents provide extra visibility when running on cloudy days or for those early morning or late evening races.

The FuelBelt Helium Race Belt with Race Bib Locks and Storage is adjustable for waist sizes from 24 to 40 inches and is the lightest racing belt in the FuelBelt line, weighing only 50 grams."
