        "(This book is not part of the Jim Richards series - it is all new)From the East coast to the West coast the NY Slasher carved his murderous spree on thirty women, and then just disappeared. Derek Harcourt wrote about the Slasher’s crimes in his first book. Now writing a second book, Harcourt has ulterior motives for this novel and is following the Slasher’s journey all the way from New York to Washington state. Sarah Keller is Harcourt’s editor and the unsuspecting victim of horrible crimes in her past and maybe her future. Will there be more murders when Harcourt and Keller finally meet?Could an author hate an editor so much that he would want to murder her? A new thriller about stalking a victim across the country and a serial killer bent on making his last murder his ultimate goal, the person he hates the most.This is not part of the Jim Richards series books by Bob Moats, this is an all new book about an author, editors and serial murders.Bob Moats is the author of 20 novels about a senior citizen sleuth named Jim Richards. He wrote the short fantasy novella “Crystal Prison of Kyr” and is a published playwright with his three act comedy “Happily Ever After”. This book takes him to a new genre, serial killings and it views from two different perspectives, the killer and the victim.~~*~~Advanced reviews:From a review on Goodreads.com by Barb Hopkins: \"A gritty mystery that held my interest, Fatal Rejection is a recommended read. I dare you to read it and not get the heebie-jeebies from Harcourt. Have already read most of this book but decided to reread from the beginning. Harcourt is most decidedly creepy. **shudder**\"--- Bob Moats, the author of over 20 continuous “Murder” books, outdid himself in “Fatal Rejection.” This fiction book is in a word, “intense”. Derek Harcourt has written and had published a true crime book about the NY Slasher, a serial killer who was never caught. Before having his book published, he was rejected many times by publishing companies. Enter, Sarah Keller, an editor of a major publishing company in New York whose husband was murdered several months ago. She decided to start over and moved across country to Washington state. But, Harcourt has other plans for Sarah and commences to drive out to her. The book is full of heart stopping suspense with likeable characters and at times a little humor. Will Sarah find happiness away from her haunted past, or will her refusal letter to publish a mad man’s book be a Fatal Rejection? I would give this book 5 stars. Reviewed by Ronnie Mercer Author of \"Unsolved Serial Killers - True Crimes\" and \"Women who Kill - True Crimes\"----Bob Moats once again amazes me with his brilliant storytelling ability. In \"Fatal Rejection\", he writes from the point of view of not only the victim but the murderer as well and he was able to pull it off wonderfully. The parts of the story told through the eyes of the victim, Sarah, were soft and light with a hint of sadness while the parts told through the murderer's eyes, Derek, were brash and hard. It was easy to get caught up in the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and found it difficult to put down. Great ending! Boni J. Rychener----All finished. I enjoyed it. I liked that the ending was out of the blue as well. Very enjoyable and the ending was a good twist.David Wilkinson, from England.---Take a walk through a psycho's mind and see just who comes up still alive by the end of the book, it's a fascinating journey.Jo Ann Hakola"

        "About the Author",
        "Detroit area resident, Bob Moats, has been writing short stories and plays for as long as he can remember. He has lost most of his original stories, typed or handwritten, in the numerous moves he has made from his hometown of Fraser, Michigan to Northern Michigan, to Las Vegas and back to Fraser, where he now lives. Moats became one of the causalities of unemployment in 2009, and had time on his hands to finally pursue a life long dream of writing a full blown crime novel. Thus was born the first book, \"Classmate Murders\". What followed was a series of books starting with \"The Classmate Murders\" which introduces the main character, Jim Richards, who has to admit he has become a senior citizen, reluctantly. Richards, one day, receives an email from a childhood sweetheart asking for his help, but by the time he reaches her, she has been murdered. His life turns around and he is pulled into numerous murders of women from his high school who he hasn't seen in forty years. Along with a friend of his, Buck, a big, mustached biker, they go off to track down the killer before he can get to one former classmate, Penny Wickens, a TV talk show host who Jim has just fallen for while protecting her. The killer is also murdering the women right out from under police protection, driving homicide detective Will Trapper crazy, and he slowly depends on Jim to help. There's humor, suspense, wild chases across suburban Detroit with cops, classic cars and motorcycle clubs; murder, mayhem, a good amount of romance and a twist ending.",
