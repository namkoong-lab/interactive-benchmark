        "The Perfect Pan's name says it all. The ultimate multitasker, it excels at searing, sautéing, browning, steaming, stir frying, and deep frying. Wide, angled sides facilitate stirring without spilling - a plus when stir frying meats and vegetable. Thanks to cast iron construction, the vessel retains heat remarkably well to ensure uniform cooking."
