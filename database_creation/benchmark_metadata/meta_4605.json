        "From the Manufacturer",
        "The Kichler Lighting 15318AZT Galaxy Low Voltage Landscape Path and Spread Light is designed to be noticed. This sophisticated, modern style in an understated fixture is perfect for accent lighting or as a path light. Made of high quality aluminum, this functional light is finished in Textured Architectural Bronze that complements any setting. The 15318AZT measures 23-Inch in height and 6-Inch at its widest point and is installation-friendly with an 8-Inch in-ground stake that is included. The 12V incandescent S-8 wedge base socket includes a 24.4 watt (VA) bulb that sheds soft, balanced light where it's wanted, without troublesome glare or hot spots. The \"VA\" (volts x amps) rating on Kichler Landscape products represents the value used when calculating the total system load. This VA number will help you determine the correct size transformer for installation. This 12 volt fixture will require a low voltage transformer of your choice for safe illumination and is supplied with 35-Inch of 18-2 gauge, SPT-1-W lead wire and cable connectors for quick connection. Optional mounting accessories are available for surface mounting with junction box (15601) and tree/surface mounting (15607). This fixture is UL/CSA listed for wet location use.
