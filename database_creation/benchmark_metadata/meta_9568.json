She still finds it hard to believe she gets paid to eat. Her award wining articles have appeared in magazines and newspapers around the country and were selected for Best Food Writing, a national anthology published annually,four times, in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2014. Cleveland Ethnic Eats, her guide to northeast Ohio's authentic ethnic restaurants, bakeries, butchers and grocery stores, first released in 1995, updated and reissued six times and now out of print, was a local bestseller for years.\", \"Her 2012 book, Cleveland's West Side Market: 100 Years & Still Cooking, authored in collaboration with Marilou Suszko, chronicles the history of one of America's oldest municipally-owned and -operated retail food markets. The pair spent two years digging deep into public records,interviewing hundreds of people and collecting vintage photos from libraries, museum archives, family albums and even a few shoe boxes hidden away in attics and closets.\", \"Her newest work The Lake View Cemetery: Photographs from Cleveland's Historic Landmark is a collaboration with artist and husband Barney Taxel.\", \"Taxel was born in New York city and grew up on two continents. Then she came to Cleveland, met a guy (who is still her guy), married and stayed put in the city she's come to love and call her own.\"]}"
