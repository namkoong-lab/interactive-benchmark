        "This acclaimed book explores popular politics during Mexico's tumultuous post-independence decades. Focusing on Mexico City during the chaotic early years of the nineteenth century, Richard Warren offers a compelling narrative of the defining period from King Ferdinand VII's abdication of the Spanish crown in 1808 to the end of Mexico's first federal republic in 1836. Clearly written and meticulously researched, this book is the first to demonstrate that the relationship between elites and the urban masses was central to Mexico's political evolution during the fight for independence and after. Mexico City, capital of both the old viceroyalty and the new nation, often witnessed the first wave of 'public opinion' to respond to competing political proposals in both traditional and new forms that ranged from riots to electoral campaigns. Warren explains the direct effects of these actions on political outcomes, as well as their influence on elite perceptions of the new nation's problems and potential solutions. Vagrants and Citizens explores the impact of urban mass mobilization on crucial issues of the era, such as the evolution of electoral practices, the conflict between federalists and centralists, and social control programs. Shedding new light on a poorly understood era, Warren demonstrates the importance of the urban masses both as actors in their own right and as objects of elite discourse and programs. His compelling narrative offers an ideal supplement for courses on Mexican and Latin American history."

        "Review",
        "An innovative perspective on the politics of Mexican independence. Focusing on how Mexico City as the seat of the Spanish viceroyalty became Mexico’s national capital, Professor Warren details how elites debating an imagined nation engaged, mobilized, yet feared city folk eager to claim the rights they imagined came with proclamations of popular sovereignty. Vagrants and Citizens confirms that the contests of nation building in Mexico were never reserved to elites. It opens questions about the social composition, cultural visions, and political participation of the urban populace that will enlighten and engage a generation of students and scholars. (John Tutino)Warren makes a solid and original contribution to an understudied period and neglected subject. Scholars and students who desire to learn more about comparative electoral politics, social control, state formation, nationalism, and social and cultural history will profit handsomely from reading Vagrants and Citizens.>>> (",

        ")A particularly fluid and well-written narrative that neatly synthesizes the main events and issues that affected Mexico City from 1808 to 1837...an extremely valuable contribution to the historiography...essential reading for anybody concerned with tackling the issues of popular politics in Mexico c. 1810 to c. 1837.

        "The Americas",
        ")A sophisticated, thoroughly up-to-date consideration of the interplay between elites and masses in the early years of independent Mexico. In a subtle approach, Richard A. Warren concentrates primarily on elections and patriotic rituals, examples of elite efforts to obtain the legitimacy provided by public sanction while also directing and limiting mass political participation. In a turbulent setting, with wider suffrage and voter turnout than almost anywhere else in the western world, Mexican elites discovered that universal male suffrage did not automatically prevent a legitimacy crisis, while the common man found there was more to democracy than voting. Professor Warren argues that the franchise alone is no gauge of a political system’s responsiveness or health. This is a significant book for the specialist, yet quite accessible for classroom use.
