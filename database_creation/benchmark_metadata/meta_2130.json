        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "From the British author of the Amazing Grace books comes a novel, the first in a trilogy, about a teen stricken with brain cancer who travels between two worlds. In modern-day London, Lucien Mulholland undergoes chemotherapy treatments, but when he falls asleep clutching a mysterious book his father has given him, he is transported, or \"stravagated,\" to an enchanting 16th-century Venice-like city called Bellezza, in the country Talia. Lucien can return only if he can get hold of the book again. In this colorful other world, rich with court intrigues and magic, he feels vibrantly alive, as opposed to his pain-ridden days back in England; his hair has grown back and he eats with relish. Bellezza is also where, as \"Luciano,\" he meets lovely 15-year-old Arianna and Rodolfo, who created the book that acts as Lucien's \"stravagation\" talisman. Rodolfo explains that a stravagante is \"a wanderer between worlds,\" and also the history of this magical travel. Now the secret brotherhood dedicated to keeping the two worlds separate is being challenged by a faction with evil intent. Soon \"Luciano\" is caught up in their power struggle and learns there is a cost when one cannot stravagate properly. The Renaissance backdrop sets an elegant mood for the time-travel toggling. This complex, at times slow-moving and somber story line may disturb some middle-graders, but the novel will likely intrigue more sophisticated readers, especially with its undercurrents of sexual tension. Ages 10-up.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "*Starred Review* Gr. 7-12. Belleza, a city that exists in a parallel dimension to sixteenth-century Venice, boils with political espionage, danger, and deception in Hoffman's vivid, suspenseful time-travel novel. Lucien, a twenty-first-century English boy, is being treated for cancer. When his father brings him an old Italian notebook to write in, his world changes as he falls asleep each night clutching his journal. At first he thinks he's dreaming of Venice, \"a city floating on the water, laced with canals, and full of domes and spires.\" But soon it becomes clear that his dreams aren't dreams at all and that he has somehow entered Belleza as Luciano, one of the Stravaganti, a brotherhood of time travelers. Before long he meets the lovely, strong-willed, 15-year-old Arianna; becomes an apprentice for the powerful magician-scientist Rodolfo; and foils an assassination attempt on the violet-eyed Duchessa. As he learns to stravagate back and forth between time and worlds, his split life becomes increasingly complicated--and dangerous. Utterly fascinating, this rich, rip-roaring adventure--the first in a series--will no doubt whet readers' appetites for Italian history and culture as well as the next installment.",

        "Grade 7 Up-Mary Hoffman's beautifully constructed novel (Bloomsbury, 2002) tells of a 21st century British teenager, Lucien, suffering from both cancer and the modern medical treatments for it, who finds that he can slip through space and time to a 16th century city that is a kind of shadow of the historical Venice. The city of Bellezza, in Talia, is brimming not only with political intrigue, but also with scientific oddities like Lucien: the Stravangante are those who are capable of travelling to other times and places, transported by specific talismen. In the case of Lucien, his transporting talisman is the Venetian notebook brought to him by his father on a visit to the hospital. Lucien's first visit to Bellezza plunges him immediately into the struggles among the reigning Duchessa and spies for a government that is akin to that in power in Renaissance Rome, interrupts a young island girl's attempt to become a mandola driver, and connects him with a Bellezzan Stravagante to whom he becomes apprenticed. Back in the 21st century, Lucien's health waxes and then wanes. This first book in a trilogy will leave listeners both contented with a fully worked tale and ready to meet forthcoming ones about the Stravagante world. Kathe Mazur's reading is sprightly and smooth, whether the passage is in flowing modern English, Elizabethan English, or peppered with quasi-Italian. This has all the earmarks of a future classic.",
