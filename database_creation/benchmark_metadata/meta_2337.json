        "[Andrew Learns about Teachers] is about teachers and I particularly appreciated the lovely dedication to all teachers. To top it off, the illustrations are adorable and \"cozy.\" They will appeal to all readers, including children, parents, and teachers. They are sweet and colorful and remind us of the joy of learning in a safe environment.\"",
        "\"Andrew Learns about Teachers is a fabulous children's book that educates while entertaining readers. It is comprehensive and extremely well designed with explanations and multiple little drawings when they are called for... This adds meaning to the text and underlines the many aspects of the job of teaching. It makes the message even clearer and more fun.\"",
        "\"",
        "[T]he author is not naïve or over-enthusiastic and sometimes adds the word \"good\" before \"teachers\" which highlights that of course she is first and foremost describing dedicated, engaged, and passionate teachers, the ones whom the students will remember forever. I highly recommend this lovely book dealing with an amazing and often difficult job and passion.\"",
        "\"The idea of getting children to know about careers at such a young age is excellent. I am looking forward to discovering and reading more volumes from this captivating series.\"",

        "About the Author",
        "For Tiffany, writing is a delayed passion, a dream deferred. After 30 years, she has finally become the author that she always knew she would and could be. Her accomplishments include being an attorney, a wife and a mother. The latter accomplishment is what inspired the current book series, Andrew's Career Day Series. The book series explores various careers and makes career day ANY day and EVERY day. Every book's lasting message is: You are never too young to aspire to be anything you want to be! Andrew loves to read and he loves asking questions. He also enjoys these books and Tiffany (and Andrew) know you and your little one will enjoy them, too! Tiffany is a native of Houston and currently resides in Houston with her husband (both Sam Houston State University alum), son and daughter.",
