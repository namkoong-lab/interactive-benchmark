        "It's not just another sex-abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of St. Paul-Minneapolis. It's worse. A lot worse. ...When Adelia Morton discovers evidence of sexual abuse committed by a local priest, she acts quickly, but not quickly enough. ...When Robert Mallory investigates what has happened, he discovers something he didn't expect. ...When Fr. Michael Reilly is accused, he settles on an unorthodox response. It begins with a strange confession one Saturday morning and before it concludes more than just the ten commandments are broken."

        "About the Author",
        "I am originally from Minnesota and know how to dress in -40 degree temperatures. I have been doing Christian youth-work since I was 19 and was one of the first Catholics to work as Area Director for Young Life. I write a monthly newsletter on youth culture (http://kairos-na.org/YouthCulture_News) and am the International Director of Kairos, a Christian youth program serving those aged 13 to 30. We sponsor high impact retreats, gap years, mission trips, university campus missions. To learn more about the work I do visit (http://kairos-na.org/) I met Pope John Paul II in 1981 during a conference I organized for 600 leaders in the Charismatic renewal, five days before he was shot. I met Yasser Arafat, the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Patriarchs of Jerusalem and one of the Chief Rabbis of Jerusalem during the visit of John Paul II to Israel. I lived for 15 years in Belfast N.I. and London, England, which was where I wrote The Archangel of Westminster. I began writing The Red Madonna in 1998 and had more or less finished it by 2002. I began the follow-up novel in 2003, and hope to finish it before the next conclave. I am also the author of A Concise Catholic Catechism, a contributor to How to be Ecumenical Today, and the creator of iPray – an aid to daily prayer. I am an Elder (leader) of the Servants of the Word, an ecumenical brotherhood of men who live the vows of celibacy, simplicity and obedience. I have visited 26 countries and speak German fluently. I travel about 10 days of the month. My pillow lives in Lansing, Michigan. My vices are golf, pistachios, chocolate and single malt scotch. Someday I will repent of them.",
