        "experienced spiritual director Alice Fryling offers a unique introduction specifically for group spiritual direction: a place where individuals can experience what it means to be listened to and loved by others, so that they can learn to listen more attentively to God in their daily lives and be used by God.Out of her years of being both director and directee, Fryling offers practical, step-by-step guidance for those who would like to start, lead or participate in group spiritual direction. Her book will help you know what to expect and fully equip you for the different aspects of the group experience, including learning to listen to God, using Scripture in a group, navigating different personalities, setting group expectations and asking life-giving questions. She also provides an appendix with opening exercises for use in your meetings together.\"The intentional goal of group spiritual direction,\" Alice writes, \"is to help each participant become more aware of God in their lives, for the sake of others. Spiritual direction leads you to an awakening of the soul.\" The Spirit is speaking to you and to others. Here is a book to help you and a group of soul friends listen for and with each other as you seek God together."
