        "Poetry. Women's Studies. At turns heartwrenching and redeeming, THE WATERMARK explores an American Southern life gone horribly awry. Rich with star&#8211;soaked skies and bayou&#8211;sodden locales, the poems propel the reader through hurricanes and heartache. Anderson explores the sharp destruction of childhood abuse and the unruly abandon of love and sex, finding grace within calamity. THE WATERMARK draws a map of the human heart, with Anderson its fierce cartographer."
