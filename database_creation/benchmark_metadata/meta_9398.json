        "This book details the treatment of Allied service-women, female civilians and local women by the Japanese occupation forces. While a number of memoirs have been published there is no dedicated volume. It chronicles the massacres of nurses (such as that at Alexandra Hospital, Singapore), disturbing atrocities on both European and Asians, and accounts of imprisonment.It reveals how many ended up in Japanese hands when they should have been evacuated. Also covered are the hardships of long marches and the sexual enslavement of white and native women (so called 'Comfort Women').The book is a testimony both to the callous and cruel behavior of the Japanese and to the courage and fortitude of those who suffered at their hands."

        "Review",
        "“Writing in a narrative, highly emotional style, Felton (Fudan University, China) describes the fates of female military nurses and civilian women and children from English-speaking countries who were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific region during WWII. Many of the women and children were held in prison camps in terrible conditions and forced on death marches. Some women were killed on sight and others were raped, beaten, and forced to become sex slaves. Much of the book showcases the words of the people who lived through this period. As sources, the author lists archives, books, scholarly papers, newspapers, periodicals, and web sites.. “",
