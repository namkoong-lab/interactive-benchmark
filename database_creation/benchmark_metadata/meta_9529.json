        "The game of basketball has evolved move by move, with the great players adding their signitures to every aspect of the sport. From George \"The Leaning Tower of Minneapolis\" Milkan's upstoppable hook shot, to Wilt \"The Big Dipper\" Chamberlain's ferocious slam dunk, to Michael Jordan's alley-oop, basketball has become one of the fastest, most athletic, and most crowd-pleasing sports. Smooth Moves is a full-color, fully detailed celebration of every important move on the court. Each chapter focuses on the history of one great move (The Jump Shot, The Drive, The No-look Pass, etc.) and explores in detail the first time the move was attempted, the players who made it great, its evolution over time, and how the game has changed with its addition. Photos fill every page with examples, and sidebars relate great moments, plays and statistics. Finally, quotations from players and coaches illuminate thoughts on plays and games."
