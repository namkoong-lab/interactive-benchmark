        "CMI’s SWAT Operator insignia has been adopted nationwide by law enforcement and corrections agencies as their official SWAT qualification insignia. The pins are constructed with a double clutch back. They are 1\" high x 1.5\" wide, and come in five different colors and three different levels (operator, senior operator, and master operator). The appeal of this insignia is that it is very professional looking, not overly aggressive or politically incorrect, and symbolizes the ideal characteristics of a SWAT Operator. Eagle: Honor and Integrity, Rifle: Firepower, K-Bar: Stealth, Lightning Bolt: Speed and Forcefulness of Action"
