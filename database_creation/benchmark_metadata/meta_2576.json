        "on March 8, 1912, marking Roald Amundsen's triumph over the tragic Robert Scott. Yet behind all the headlines there was a much bigger story. Antarctica was awash with expeditions. In 1912, five separate teams representing the old and new world were diligently embarking on scientific exploration beyond the edge of the known planet. Their discoveries not only enthralled the world, but changed our understanding of the planet forever. Tales of endurance, self–sacrifice, and technological innovation laid the foundations for modern scientific exploration, and inspired future generations.To celebrate the centenary of this groundbreaking work,",

Working in both the Antarctic and Arctic, Chris is extending historic records of change in the polar regions back to 130,000 years ago to help better understand the future. Described by the UK Saturday Times as the 'new David Livingstone', he is passionate about communicating science from the field and laboratory.\", \"Chris is the author of numerous books, scientific papers and magazine articles. His most recent book is called '1912: The Year The World Discovered Antarctica'. 1912 has received rave reviews and tells the largely unknown scientific endeavours of the five scientific expeditions in Antarctica one hundred years ago. He shows how the endeavours of 1912 marked the dawn of a new age in understanding of the natural world, and how lessons from a century ago might reawaken the public's passion for scientific discovery and exploration. Inspired by this remarkable period, Chris led the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 (www.spiritofmawson.com).\", \"In 2007 Chris was awarded the Sir Nicholas Shackleton Medal for outstanding young Quaternary scientists, and in 2009 he received the Geological Society of London's Bigsby Medal for services to geology. To do something positive about climate change, he helped set up a carbon refining company called Carbonscape (http://carbonscape.com/) which has developed technology to fix carbon from the atmosphere and make a host of green bi-products, helping reduce greenhouse gas levels.\", 'Chris is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Geological Society of London, and the Royal Geographical Society.']}"
