        "There’s freedom in remembering.My past is a double-edged sword.Damned if I remember; damned if I don’t.Recollection beyond the horrors I already have will change me. Change us. But what if I’m living a lie? What if everything I believe is wrong? What if who I thought I was isn’t real?If not her, then…Who am I?Eddie says it doesn’t matter, but deep down, I’m terrified it does.I’m trapped. Held prisoner by a past I can’t remember and a future that may not belong to me.There’s a light, though not at the end of the tunnel… It’s wavering in the distance, calling to me from Rumor Island.That light, it scares me far more than darkness. Am I brave enough to confront it? So many questions, so few answers.I don’t have a choice; the truth always finds a way to the surface. Finally learning who I truly am will be a permanent life sentence.Total punishment or absolute amnesty."
