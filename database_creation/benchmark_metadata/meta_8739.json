        "About the Author",
        "Harvey B. Chess's years in the nonprofit sector have usually involved the give and take between organizations with grants to give and nonprofits that compete to get those grants. This began in the original Federal War On Poverty and culminated with his highly regarded, well travelled workshop for nonprofit grant seekers. In between he was consultant to several grant making foundations and Program Officer for a large Community Foundation. The breadth of his experience allowed him to settle into a theme of challenging people to re-examine the basis for their nonprofit organizations' existence, always with an eye on strengthening them - and their strategies for pursuing needed resources. Much of what he has come to learn, practice and value forms the basis for his less nomadic existence as the author of the revised edition of his book. He considers this book his legacy in gratitude for a lifetime among so many remarkable souls seeking to improve their communities at the grassroots.",

This includes my being retained by public and private sector grant makers to work with people in organizations seeking funding, along with making recommendations about whether or not to fund applicants for foundation funding.\", 'All of my efforts while working with others, previously face-to-face and now in writing, take into consideration what I learned about the challenges you confront in trying to support your nonprofit organizations in these tough times and in the highly competitive funding marketplace.', \"So, this book of mine concentrates on helping you overcome resource development and sustainability challenges. You'll have the opportunity to front and center tactics that separate your nonprofit from the crowd by distinguishing it as substantial, enterprising and resilient.\", 'I also wrote this book to reflect my values as a nonprofit activist and for \"the champions dedicated to the success of community members for and with whom they built a nonprofit.\"', 'Tom David, a longstanding consultant in the craft of grantmaking, philanthropic strategy, evaluation and organizational learning had this to offer after reading the book: \"Harvey Chess... delights in challenging conventional wisdom and appropriately focuses on fund development as integral to the larger, more fundamental challenge of building and strengthening organizations.
