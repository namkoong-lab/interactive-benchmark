        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Robson ( Walk In My Soul ) opens this well-researched Japanese historical romance in 1702, during the rein of shogun Tsunayoshi, with young heroine Cat at the start of a long quest for vengeance. Lord Kira has caused the disgrace and death of her father, Lord Asano. Cat, the illegitimate daughter of Lord Asano and his \"outside-wife,\" is penniless, powerless and herself the prey of Kira's warriors. As the first step in rehabilitating her father's name, she must find Oishi Kuranosuke, leader of her father's samurai. Disguised as an itinerant beggar-priest she begins her search for Oishi on the dangerous Tokaido Road, experiencing myriad adventures along the way. Robson has based this picaresque tale on an actual feud and steeped it in the custom and culture of feudal Japan. The narrative is weighted down with explications of Zen thought and Japanese poetry, of the country's rigid caste system, even of the subtle nuances of using a bow. have restored some of what was cut When we don't like a book, we have to tell why. Honor is the operative element in this legend, taking precedence over everything, wish to restore the following 2 words; they are crucial to the meaning and justifying even the orgy of killing at the epic climax. Robson's detailed historiography is impressive, but the novel lacks the vital spark that might keep readers immersed in Cat's adventures. Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.",

        "In 18th-century feudal Japan, 47 former retainers of Lord Asano avenged his forced suicide by killing Lord Kira. Robson embellishes this story, giving Asano a daughter by a second wife. When the novel begins, the daughter Kinume, known as Cat, has become a courtesan in the pleasure district of Edo--later Tokyo--to support herself rather than become a nun as had her mother. Trained in the samurai arts, Cat has vowed revenge on Kira. She sets out to find her father's chief councilor, which means a 300-mile trip to Kyoto. Pursued by Kira's hirelings, she is joined on the Tokaido road by a peasant girl, Kasane, and by Hanshiro, a lordless samurai who had been assigned to find Cat. Replete with hand-to-hand battles, rooftop chases, and perilous escapes, their adventures are also rich in details of customs, attire, ritual, and terrain, punctuated with poetry. Written by a former librarian, this depiction of an era commands interest. Recommended for historical fiction collections, especially those building a Far East segment.

        "s catgut strings. When the music stopped the women froze. Anyone who moved had to take something off.As the jars of rice wine emptied and were refilled by silent attendants, the dancers found it more difficult to stay motionless during the drum's silences. Around the women's feet, their silk robes and underrobes and their long brocade sashes swirled in a shimmering lake of color. Their stiff, white, split-toed cotton socks floated like ducks on top.The game had reached the point where the guests joined in. Apparently one of the men was dancing with an undergarment draped over his head. Cat could hear its owner's giggles and playful slaps as she tried to retrieve it.As Cat knelt, watching her own guest die, she heard the merrymaking as she would have heard a distant waterfall or a windstorm. She was still wearing her thinly quilted lavender silk robe and a heavy brocade sash. Over it she wore a full, plum-colored satin coat embroidered with peacocks and crimson maple leaves. It kept her warm in the chill of the eleventh month. Its heavy, trailing sleeves were folded neatly across her thighs, as though she were a guest at a tea ceremony.The soft light of the floor lantern outlined the long slope of Cat's neck rising into the glossy black loops and wings of her hairdo. The collars of her robes were set far back to reveal the most alluring part of a woman's body, the sensuous, vulnerable curve of spine and nape. Therush light glowed on Cat's face, delicate and slender as a melon seed. The gold of its flame was reflected in the dark brown irises of Cat's eyes.Cat had swallow's eyes, long and curved. Her feathery black eyebrows arched high and symmetrical as a silkworm moth's antennae. She had brows that physiognomists said belonged to someone who made plans and carried them out. Her narrow, high-bridged nose and the full lips of her small mouth cast shadows across her chalky-white cheek.Cat was as cultured as she was beautiful. She was the secret daughter of a",

        "Lord Asano, and his outside-wife. She had been trained in music and literature and art. She had never thought she would use her skills in a house of assignation in Edo's pleasure district, but then she couldn't have foreseen the tragedy that had brought ruin and disgrace to her mother and father.A year ago Cat, whose real name was Kinume, Golden Plum, had arrived here on foot. Palanquins were not allowed in Edo's pleasure district, the Yoshiwara. She had hidden herself under a striped travel cloak and large-brimmed hat of woven sedge. Two of her dead father's former box bearers had followed single file with a large wicker chest slung on a pole between them. The chest had held Cat's remaining silk robes and sashes and her favorite books and scrolls, her matched, lacquered cosmetic set, her writing box, and a few precious keepsakes.Cat herself had signed the contract with the owner of the House of the Carp where she would live. By the time her grief-stricken mother learned what she had done, it was too late to change her decision.When Cat's high wooden pattens clattered across the slate paving of the House of the Carp's entryway, she had been struck by doubt so sudden and intense, she had almost turned around and left. But Cat's nature wasn't to quit what she had begun. She had hidden her fear and grief and loneliness behind a lovely, impassive mask ever since.The usual custom was to give oneself a new name when starting out on an important enterprise. A different name was especially vital in Cat's case, to keep her real identity a secret. Her friend Plover had begun calling her Koneko, Little Cat.Plover used the nickname affectionately, and it caught on. Others began calling her Cat because she was as graceful and aloof and unpredictable as her namesake. But Golden Plum couldn't replace her sorrow the way the nickname Cat replaced her old name and identity. She could only do her duty as the daughter of a lord and a warrior and endure her fate without complaint or self-pity.She moved through her duties in the assignation house called the Perfumed Lotus with the grace and reserve of her class and breeding.

Saliva oozed in a froth from his half-opened lips and dangled in a thin rope from his chin. His wiry black topknot was askew. His eyes were open.Without rising from her knees, Cat moved closer. She laid two pale, slender, impeccably manicured fingers on his neck. Nothing. Not a flutter of a heartbeat. The customer had left his homely body, never to return. The next occupants would be small, white, and legless. Already a hardy fly, an emigre from the privy, was circling solicitously.Cat felt panic rising from the seat of her soul, behind her navel. She drew several deep breaths. She needed to be calm. She needed to think.Soon the watchman would strike midnight, the hour of the Rat, on his wooden clappers. At midnight Centipede would close the small door in the Great Gate. He would lock the corpse into the pleasure district and into Cat's company until cock's crow.Cat was sure the guest had been murdered.

I mentioned Cynthia Ann\\'s story to Brian and his editor who referred me to Pamela Strickler of Ballantine Books.

It also won the Western Writers of America\\'s Spur Award for Best Historical Novel of the year.
