        "Compelling, dark cabaret with a little glam and a lot of innovation. Imagine the 1980s as an agrarian society. Imagine the spirits of Bald Mountain forming a rock band. Originally on Animal World/Global Symphonic, Absolutely Kosher has re-released this masterpiece with extra tracks.",
        "Review",
        "(9.1 out of 10) Personal and cultural memory bleed together, as Mercer spins fractured images lifted straight from the pages of Grimm Brothers fairy tales and Homeric Epics. And yet, nothing about The Golden River seems contrived or gratuitously literary: its otherworldly sonic and lyric richness is matched at every turn by the striking immediacy of Mercer's wide-eyed delivery. The result is a record every bit as stunning and imaginative as it is memorable and affecting, and one of the most unique and interesting I've heard in ages. --PitchforkThis album is a flight above the woeful world, launched on the wings of pure nervous energy. The Golden River is intensely textured and yes, ultimately prophetic; it speaks greatly to its strengths that, like the wandering madman, you will never quite figure this whole thing out. --Better Propoganda's Top 100 Albums of The DecadeThis album is a flight above the woeful world, launched on the wings of pure nervous energy.
