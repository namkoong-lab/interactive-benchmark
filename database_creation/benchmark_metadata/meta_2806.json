        "Amy L. Bernstein writes for the page, the stage, and forms in between. Her literary preoccupations include rooting for the underdog and putting ordinary people in difficult situations to see how they wriggle out. Amy is an award-winning journalist and speechwriter as well as a playwright. When she's not glued to her computer, she loves listening to jazz and classical music, drinking wine with friends, and prowling around Baltimore's glorious waterfront.",
