        "WoodChart's beautiful map of Chesapeake Bay. A 3-D nautical wood map of the Chesapeake Bay region. More than 150 rivers and streams drain into Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States. It drains a basin of over 64,000 square miles into the Atlantic Ocean, but it's actually quite shallow. Its average depth is only 21 feet and almost a quarter of the bay is less than 6 feet deep. Points of Interest Include: Arlington, Baltimore, Dover, Lexington Park, Nanticoke River, Pocomoke Sound, Potomac River, and Washington D.C. Our wood charts are made from Baltic birch and have a solid wood frame. They come ready to hang."
