        "Why are we so vulnerable to others’ judgement? What makes us accept tags, hide behind them, lower our personality, silence down our inner voice and let them define us? Why do we bend our heads to sarcastic remarks, allow getting bullied or worse, from childhood and throughout life? Is it because of fear, depression, low self-esteem? Or are all these just by-products? Is Happiness only real in fairy tales or only reserved to others? No way! Or, not any more! Long live Happy Endings! Or Happy Beginnings! And, now that we started, why not Long Live Happy Fulfilled Lives ! Based on a so very common but nevertheless so very painful separation, narrated with humour and lucidity, Angelika Delf explores one of the most fundamental questions: Why? And all this mess becomes the basis of the reconciliation with the past, Life and most importantly, with the inner Self."

        "About the Author",
        "Angelika Delf used to be a seriously heartbroken, neurotic, fade, shy, clumsy, life-passing-by bystander. She would like to be a mysteriously magnificent, outrageously brilliant quantum physicist or an Indiana-Jones-like extremely brave and seductively famous archaeologist. What she really is: an exasperatedly loving Greek-French mom, with a multicolored personal accent, still clumsy, who loves to laugh, loves to observe but mostly, loves to communicate in her own way, with everyone and everything - with God, with Mother Nature, with the Universe and with the inner Self. All is energy after all. One of her favorite quotes is Oscar Wilde's \"Life is too important to be taken seriously\", which she tries to apply on a daily basis."
