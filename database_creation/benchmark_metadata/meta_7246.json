        "Another name in another city; Mason Standing feels he’s in the twilight of life…if his life would end. That’s why his torturous existence makes so much sense. An angel who fell with Satan didn’t deserve comfort and happiness. Mason exists; he no longer lives. Until he meets a pair of hazel eyes...then his bitterness turns to desire for this artist, Oasis Jones, who can steal his breath with just her touch. But his past won’t let him rest. The Devil would find him here too, in the sordid French Quarter of New Orleans just like he found Mason in every other place in the world for centuries. This eternal vendetta would not be satisfied until Mason would see another he cared for dying in his arms as she is sacrificed to the Devil as the purest of blood on earth. It was time to take a stand – starting with the voodoo shop down the street. And this time, she wouldn’t be lost, unless Mason was."

        "About the Author",
        "E.L. Pearson has rarely been seen without a book in her hand. Naturally, this opportunity to share with others the story God placed upon her heart has represented the apex of her life's dreams. From early on, this natural born author has been fascinated by the art of telling stories; her favorites to this day include White's The Once and Future King and Scott's Ivanhoe. According to those who know her best, the first literature that truly made her imagination blossom were in fact Bible stories... especially those involving Angels. As her fascination with these celestial beings grew, so did a yearning to weave a compelling storyline and thus, the bedrock for Prodigal Lost was born. Through her own trials and failures, E.L. Pearson has seen the influence of darkness in this fallen world and has herself felt the burden of those who feel suffocated by it. But through her faith, she has also felt the joy of God's grace and mercy, a redemptive power which pulled her from her despair and set her to work reaching others with a life-saving message. E.L Pearson desires but one thing - to let the world know that no matter the sin, no matter the stain from the past, Jesus Christ is the cleansing power of redemption. As her relationship with God has grown, so have her blessings, which include a patient and loving husband and twin sons who remind her just how much God loves her. Together, they do life in Nebraska."
