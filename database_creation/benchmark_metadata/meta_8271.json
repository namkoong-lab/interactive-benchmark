        "She is a Russian mafia princess, kidnapped to be used as a pawn in a deadly turf war. I was hired to bring her home, but the moment I saw her I knew I must have her for myself. She can run, but I will always be watching from the shadows. Like a feral beast stalking his prey, waiting for the right moment to take what is mine. I am her protector, but no one can protect her from me. Publisher's Note: Sweet Ferocity is a stand-alone novel which is the fifth and final entry in the Ruthless Obsession series. It includes spankings, rough sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book."

        "Review",
        "I've read all of this author's dark romance mafia books, and when I say she is QUEEN, she. is. QUEEN. Her men are Addictive, hot, alpha holes, ruthless and deviants. Kylie T.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Sweet Ferocity might be my favorite of the series by far. Between Luka's sweet side, his dirty mouth and Katie's defiance this has it all. - BookBirches ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ So ferociously raw that it will shock the readers into silence! Ana E. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ If you like spicy, mafia romance with action, plot and complete over the top alpha males, bad a$$ females then this book is for you!  - Amber K. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Move over alphas!!! Luka is THE alpha of all alphas! Sweet Ferocity is fiercely hot! My favorite story in this series hands down! - Melissa C. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I'm like a broken record but nobody writes a possessive, dominant Russian mafia man like this author and they just keep getting better and better. Caffe and Books ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ If you like mafia romance, spicy scenes, and that hot yummy alpha male.... get this! Jo McCall, Dark Romance Author ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ One of the greatest things I love about Zoe's books and this series, specifically is that we see ALL the characters interact with one another. It's like a family reunion with every book. Karen ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I never want this series to end. I am obsessed with these characters. - Vxhexn Reads ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Zoe Blake has done it again! Another hot mafia hero and spunky heroine! Spicy, belt snapping goodness! - Tina J. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Nobody writes fabulous Alpha men like Zoe Blake, and Luka is no exception, he is very dominant and possessive. - Kelly Reads Books ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This book was ten stars of delicious! I thought I had read it all but Luka....is an over the top alpha and probably the best written from Zoe Blake. - Nancy R. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I always fall in love with the men Zoe writes!! - Samantha H. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This Mafia romance story has it all. Tattooed, growly, sexy possessive alpha. Mafia Princess. Arranged marriage. Strong female lead. Fast paced story.  - Tiffany J. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This entire series is amazing and this book did not disappoint! All of Zoe's men are sexy, possessive and dirty AF and I love every second of it! - Abbie S. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
