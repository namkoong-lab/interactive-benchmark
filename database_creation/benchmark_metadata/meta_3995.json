        "Kershaw’s Leek is the perfect EDC, now more versatile with a partially serrated blade. A perfect holiday present, the Leek fits discreetly in a stocking or wrapped under the tree. Its slim design is easy to carry and the Sandvik 14C28N stainless steel blade is capable of a variety of cutting tasks. Great for holiday comfort food prep, the modified drop-point blade is an excellent slicer and the slim tip is good for detailed work. Both the blade and handle are bead-blasted for a non-reflective matte appearance. Equipped with SpeedSafe assisted opening, the Leek easily opens with one hand by using the built in flipper. A secure locking liner keeps the blade locked open for safe operation, and a Tip-lock slider keeps the blade closed for safe transportation. The Leek’s reversible pocket clip is user adjustable for either sided carry, and the pre-drilled handle allows attachment to a lanyard or keychain. Celebrate love, caring and fellowship during the holidays; give the gift of Kershaw."
