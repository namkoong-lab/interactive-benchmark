Your standard M-style air hose connectors and air tool connectors won’t let your pneumatic tools work at their highest capacity. This compressor hose connector set comes with male air hose fittings and female fittings. Standard compressor air fittings can leak air, limiting your maximum PSI. But, with this air compressor hose fittings set, your pneumatic cut off tool can work without dips in air flow that occur with standard air hose couplers and plugs. The quick connect coupler has a one hand push-to-lock design that makes changing tools fast and easy. Kit includes: (1) High Flow Plug (1/4 Inch Body, 3/8 Inch FNPT), (1) High Flow Plug (1/4 Inch Body, 3/8 Inch MNPT), (2) High Flow Plugs (1/4 Inch Body, 3/8 Inch FNPT), and (3) High Flow Couplers (1/4 Inch Body, 3/8 Inch MNPT)."
