        "This is a high quality paraffin wax that melts quickly. The bag will keep your wax safely stored for years, and is a perfect container for scooping accurate amounts of granules from. Our paraffin is a very common ingredient as a candle making wax - it is often combined with soy wax for votive and container candle making. Use it as an unscented candle wax base for adding fragrance oils and candle dyes. This is a food grade wax, extremely useful for coating candies and as a chocolate wax. Mixing paraffin wax in with chocolate will give it a wonderful glossy sheen when finished. Use it on sticking wood, as a skateboard wax, on snow shovels and saw blades - and more! Because we want you to be happy with our product, please note that parafin wax has a high melting point, and is not ideal in a paraffin wax warmer or wax melting machines that do not work at this temperature. Use our Parapeutic Wax for that. PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR LABELING HAS RECENTLY CHANGED. The product remains the same. If you get a box with a different label than a previous order, rest assured it is the same product from us; and yes it's still proudly made in North America."
