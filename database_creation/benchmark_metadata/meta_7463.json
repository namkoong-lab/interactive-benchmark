        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "Kraybill, Nolt, and Weaver-Zercher (Amish Grace) team up once more to offer insight into the often misunderstood world of the Amish. Refreshingly, this study makes a point of focusing on the spiritual and theological aspects of their world rather than simply cataloguing the outward cultural characteristics. Horse-drawn transportation and simple clothing do make their appearances, but they are revealed to be simply incidental to a deeply felt faith rather than something to gawk at. Focusing on a triumvirate of religious beliefs, practices, and affections, the authors weave the spirituality of the Amish through the everyday fibers of existence. Chapters are organized by broad themes including \"nature,\" \"sorrow,\" and \"family,\" then further subdivided into short vignettes featuring a particular practice or belief. The final chapter contains the broadest appeal. It includes a candid appraisal of the costs of living the Amish way, but, more importantly, also suggests how American culture could greatly benefit from the patient faith of this proudly \"peculiar\" people. All together, the book reads quickly and provides a fine and appropriately simple introduction to the Amish faith. (Oct.) (c) Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

        "Review",
        "In their second book together after their best-selling",
        "Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy",
        ", Kraybill (senior fellow, Young Ctr. of Elizabethtown Coll.), Steven M. Nolt (history, Goshen Coll.), and David L. Weaver-Zercher (American religious history, Messiah Coll.) go further in depth into Amish spirituality.Filled with Amish voices, the book is a compelling weave of anecdotes of Amish religious beliefs, practices, and affections, divided into four parts: spirituality, community, everyday life, and the things that matter. Describing the Amish faithful as secure, serene, and content, the authors further explore ways in which the non-Amish, or \"English,\" can learn from Amish spirituality. Their inclusion of a short history of Anabaptists (the antecessors of the Amish), a sample lectionary, and the \"Rules of a Godly Life\" makes this insightful work even more delightful.",
        "VERDICT",
        "Adding to the growing body of literature on the Amish, this book will be a welcome addition to academic religion collections and of interest to readers at public libraries as well. (",

        "From the Inside Flap",
        "The Amish continue to be a source of curiosity for millions of people who are fascinated by, and sometimes attracted to, their steadfast ways. The 2006 shootings at the schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, heightened public interest in this unique people, and their extraordinary acts of compassion in the wake of that tragedy both inspired and puzzled many observers. The Amish themselves do little to satisfy this curiosity, and they trust very few outsiders to do it for them.",

Kraybill, Ph.D., is senior fellow at the Young Center of Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pa. Among his many publications, he has authored, coauthored, or edited eight books on Amish society. The Riddle of Amish Culture (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)is his flagship book that explains why the Amish are thriving. Amish Grace and The Amish Way (both by Jossey-Bass) explore Amish forgiveness and spirituality. His Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites and Mennonites is the only book that provides an overview of some 200 Anabaptist groups in North America. Kraybill's The Upside-Down Kingdom, which won the Religious Book of the Year Award, in print for more that thirty years, it is still widely read. His books have been translated into more than half a dozen languages. The Young Center, where he is based, is the premiere national institute for Amish studies. Kraybill's commentary on Amish life has been featured in dozens of broadcast and print media including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian (London), The Australian, Newsweek, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, NPR, and BBC Radio to name a few.\"]}"
