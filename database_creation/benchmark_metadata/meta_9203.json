        "Dr.",
        "James Jaccard",
        "is Professor of Social Work at New York University Silver School of Social Work. He received his doctoral degree from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1976. Dr. Jaccard’s research focuses on adolescent and young adult problem behaviors, particularly those related to unintended pregnancy and substance use, broadly defined. He has developed parent-based interventions to teach parents how to more effectively communicate and parent their adolescent children so as to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies and problems due to substance use. Dr. Jaccard has written numerous books and articles on the analysis of interaction effects in a wide range of statistical models and teaches advanced graduate courses on structural equation modeling. He has written influential articles on the issue of arbitrary metrics in social science research. Dr. Jaccard also has written about theory construction and how to build conceptual models in a book published by Guilford Press."
