Kerry has since become Lieutenant of the Chicago Police Department’s Crime Scene Investigation team. She utilizes the Choice system, a computer network that registers the thoughts of willing citizens, to keep the city safe. Most believe that the Choice system has allowed America to retain freedoms absent elsewhere in the world. Connor is a skeptic, and his outspoken views have led to his success. Now wealthy, the O’Malleys live in comfort and freedom with their two children in an idyllic Chicago suburb.One autumn day, their comfort is shattered. While Kerry delves into an organized crime plot with national security implications, the O’Malleys are violently attacked. The subsequent investigation leads Kerry to an enemy she has long worked to eradicate. A meeting between the crime boss and the CSI Lieutenant leads to more questions than answers. This exciting, action-packed adventure is the first installment of the O’Malley family’s epic efforts to save the very idea of liberty."

        "From the Author",
        "The 2021 Edition:The Not-So-Distant Future series was originally authored from 2006-2009, and then edited and published in 2012-2015.  Then, in 2021, I felt as though God was calling me to re-edit the novels.  This new version of the series does not change the core story or message, but some of the details have changed.  More importantly, I believe the central message is now clearer.  A chilling dystopian world comes to life in these pages.  Alongside the hopeful wonder of near-future science fiction is a decrepit society, the characteristics and origins of which you may recognize in our own world.  Fiction serves the purpose of entertainment, but it can also act as a harbinger.  It is my hope that as you read or reread these stories, they will make bare critical truths that can save our own world from similar devastation.  At the very least, I pray that as you see these characters struggle against their Goliath, their story will bolster your motivation to move your own mountains.  Never forget where your hope comes from; you may not be strong enough to conquer what you face, but there is One with power beyond imagination, and He will lead you through. From 2012:My family's love and support for my passion of writing has inspired me and fueled my drive to publish these books.  I owe gratitude to my family and friends who are my editors, willing to read my works and offer real-time critique as I write.  They have made me a better writer.  I would particularly like to thank my parents, who have never ceased their encouragement and support for all of my dreams.  In the analogy my Dad crafted for me when I was six years old, I will approach every challenge like we did Seneca Rocks! M.K. Gilmour"
