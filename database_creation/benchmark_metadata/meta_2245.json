She's in good company, though, when she moves in with a bunch of equally maladjusted misfits: Josh, a terminally nice boy, has issues; Kate, the high-flying, no-nonsense career girl, wilts every time a married man comes along; and then there's Addison, the drop-dead-gorgeous lodger (\"Johnny Depp in geek form\") who never leaves his room, already has a girlfriend (albeit over the Internet), and is a certified",

        "Riding goofy, self-deprecating Bridget Jones's coattails in this second novel by the British author of Amanda's Wedding is a clumsy 28-year-old florist named Holly Livingstone, who desperately needs a sympathetic London flatmate. While most women always pick the wrong men, Holly assures us that she picks the wrong places to live. Since she makes barely more than the minimum wage when most of her fellow college grads are concerned with mortgages Holly's apartment prospects are limited to dubious arrangements such as the \"Turkish Lesbian Women's Collective\" until Josh, a former college classmate of indeterminate sexual orientation, takes pity on her. Josh lives in a rundown old house in Pimlico with posh, business-studies Kate and a rarely seen or heard from computer nerd named Addison Farthing. Once Holly gets one look at Addison, however (by barging into his room, which is equipped like the Star Trek Enterprise), she begins spinning fantasies of perpetual geek bliss. What it lacks in plot, Colgan's spirited, eye-rolling romp tries hard to make up for in characterization of Holly's idiosyncratic flatmates Josh and Kate, her working-class florist acquaintances (including one tough chick who beats her up), various unpromising young men who will never go for her (but sometimes do) and ungainly, unsociable Addison himself. Colgan keeps the dialogue skipping along with tongue-in-cheek, exclamatory asides such as \"Poo!\" and \"Had I let a four-year-old do the shopping?\" In the end, it's Holly who has to carry this serviceably silly novel. She is snake-tongued, unambitious, rude a lot of the time, but she'd be almost likable if she didn't sound so familiar. Though the field is dangerously close to being glutted, American readers may fall for this desperate-to-be-liked, lowest-common-denominator girlfriend.",

        "There is no doubt that confessional chronicles narrated by aspiring British hipsters have become popular with American readers. Here, Colgan follows up Amanda's Wedding, her first contribution to this new class of humorous fiction, with the tale of a young, would-be florist smitten by the computer geek with whom she and two friends share a flat. Holly's late-night encounters with reticent programmer Addison and his agoraphobic cyber-girlfriend, Claudia, are rife with the absurdities and social ineptitude that modern communication engenders. Meanwhile, the cast of characters assembled for this satirical romp would give Thackeray a run for his money: there's Josh, perched precariously on the sexual-identity fence; Chali, a wannabe rock singer goldbricking in her uncle's flower shop; and poor, overlooked Finn, whose good intentions are almost always misunderstood. At once unpredictable and endearing, this book should find its way into the hands of those ready for a chuckle at the expense of contemporary life.

        "Holly personifies the nearly 30-something Londoner coming of age in the computer generation. It's tempting to think of Bridget Jones, but Holly is funnier, brighter, and less whiny. She is a freelance florist, who shares a flat with a couple of school chums, Josh and Kate, and a reclusive computer geek named Addison. Once Holly sets her cap for Addison, the novel turns a hilarious eye on the horrors endured by today's dating singles. Characters may fumble, fall off walls, or otherwise make fools of themselves, but Colgan's humor is deft. Kudos for narrator Anne Flosnik's unbridled enthusiasm. She howls her way through H.M.S. PINAFORE and wholeheartedly yelps slacker-rock lyrics that elevate death to a preferred status. Flosnik's performance creates memorable personalities for Colgan's assortment of witty Brits.
