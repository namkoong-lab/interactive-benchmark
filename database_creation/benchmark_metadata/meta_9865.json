        "Our DCXL plants were selected from the seeds of a selfed DCXL plant for parental traits. The DCXL is well known for surpassing the B52 in terms of claw size. Compared to the B52, The DCXL will grow longer leaves. The DCXL is a hardier plant than the B52, and grows a much bigger root system. Your terrarium will start off with several DCXL plants, and eventually multiply to over 30 plants over the course of 6 months.",
        "Our Venus Fly Traps grow in a gel medium that contains all the necessary nutrients and water to grow and thrive! Once the Fly Trap grows too large for the container (takes over 6 months), you can open the lid, take it out using tweezers, and plant it in 3 parts sphagnum peat moss and 1 part perlite (no added fertilizers). By this time your Venus Flytrap will have divided to over 30 plant clusters while increasing in height and claw size.",
        "Instructions: DO NOT remove the lid until you plan on taking the plant out, or the gel will become contaminated with mold. Set it on a surface avoiding sunlight or strong light with heat (fluorescent or LED is fine, but will cause interior condensation). A darker area “tells” the plants to grow taller, and a brighter area “tells” the plants to green up, broaden the leaves, and increase claw size. Play with these parameters to customize your growth! Enjoy your plant for months, without worrying about maintenance, bugs, or spills! That’s it! Your purchase will include a care guide.",
        "At Bloomify, we use state of the art plant technology to bring you beautiful maintenance free plants. Our plants are non-GMO and sustainably propagated in house. The gel that our plants live in is known as tissue culture media. In plant biology research, plants are grown and reproduced in tissue culture media.
