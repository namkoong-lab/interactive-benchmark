        "“Kin moved me, disturbed me, and hypnotized me in ways very few memoirs have.\" –Rosanne Cash",
        "A heart stopping memoir of a wrenching Appalachian girlhood and a multilayered portrait of a misrepresented people, from Rona Jaffe Writer's Award winner Shawna Kay Rodenberg.",
        "When Shawna Kay Rodenberg was four, her father, fresh from a ruinous tour in Vietnam, spirited her family from their home in the hills of Eastern Kentucky to Minnesota, renouncing all of their earthly possessions to live in the Body, an off-the-grid End Times religious community. Her father was seeking a better, safer life for his family, but the austere communal living of prayer, bible study and strict regimentation was a bad fit for the precocious Shawna. Disciplined harshly for her many infractions, she was sexually abused by a predatory adult member of the community. Soon after the leader of the Body died and revelations of the sexual abuse came to light, her family returned to the same Kentucky mountains that their ancestors have called home for three hundred years. It is a community ravaged by the coal industry, but for all that, rich in humanity, beauty, and the complex knots of family love. Curious, resourceful, rebellious, Shawna ultimately leaves her mountain home but only as she masters a perilous balancing act between who she has been and who she will become.",
        "Kin",
        "is a mesmerizing memoir of survival that seeks to understand and make peace with the people and places that were survived. It is above all about family-about the forgiveness and love within its bounds-and generations of Appalachians who have endured, harmed, and held each other through countless lifetimes of personal and regional tragedy."

        "Review",
        "“Defies easy definition . . .Partly a memoir about growing up in an end-times religious community, partly the story of the author’s childhood in a dilapidated mining town,",

        "The Washington Post",
        "“From the opening pages of this singularly American memoir, author Shawna Kay Rodenberg enchants . . . this super-smart, gorgeously gritty debut smashes stereotypes and has a similar can't-take-your-eyes-off-it appeal as Tara Westover's EDUCATED.” -",

        "Newsday",
        "“Whatever you believe about Appalachia, prepare to have those beliefs upended, or at least beautifully complicated. Unless, of course, you are from there, and then prepare to glimpse what is possible.",
        "Kin",
        "in about remembering ‘who and what’ we are―to not only making peace with that, but to shape it into something remarkable” -",
        "Nick Flynn, author of THIS IS THE NIGHT OUR HOUSE WILL CATCH FIRE",
        "“Shawna Kay Rodenberg tells her story with a near-heroic self-awareness and insight into her family, her Appalachian ancestors, her spiritual suffering and religious sustenance, the damage done by generations of abuse, and the damage repaired by love and her own self-witness. She is a masterful storyteller, and I have tremendous admiration for her lucid courage and for the way her personal resiliency seems to have generated a specific kind of prose, both powerful and kind.” -",
        "Rosanne Cash",
        "“This startling memoir of a wild soul will electrify you. The unbreakable Shawna Kay rises again and again to forgive, despite every institution that failed her.” -",
        "Bonnie Jo Campbell, author of MOTHERS, TELL YOUR DAUGHTERS",

        "Janisse Ray, author of ECOLOGY OF A CRACKER CHILDHOOD",
        "“Shawna Kay Rodenberg may have been born 'bruised-ass-backward into a world of chaos' in Appalachia, but her memoir",
        "Kin",
        "is so full of ballsy intelligence and unremitting love that it feels like secular scripture. Like Richard Wright's",

        "Benjamin Anastas, author of TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE",
        "“I hope this book will fall into the hands of everyone who has ever swallowed their words, hid their scars, been mocked, laughed at, or ignored. Rodenberg’s lyricism, mastery of form, and command of image and metaphor are matched only by the power of her honesty and the precision of her recall.",

Good for biography readers eager to explore the complexities of family relationships, or readers interested in women’s lives in Appalachia.” -",
        "Library Journal",
        "“A fascinating memoir. What makes this one special is the way the debut author widens her view to tell the stories of her parents, grandparents, and other relatives, including times before she was born, with as much compassion and realistic detail as she gives her own story . . . a nuanced portrait of a complicated place and people.” -",
        "Booklist (starred review)",
        "“Kin is highly readable, even in the darkest of its many dark moments. Rodenberg is a gifted writer and brings her setting to life. It is a beautifully written look at resilience and the power of family and place.” -",
        "Bookreporter",
        "“[Rodenberg] intersperses third-person accounts of her mother's life in Kentucky and her father's before he went to Vietnam . . . the alternating chapters provide context and feed Rodenberg's overarching theme about how stories repeat in families, that lineage ‘wasn't about the past, like people often thought, so much as the future’ . . . [Rodenberg’s] life doesn't end with the memoir's last page. There's always more to be said. Here's hoping she will.” -",
        "The Minneapolis Star Tribune",
        "“Rodenberg’s memoir captures so many of the feelings Appalachian young people experience as they must choose between staying in the place they love or leaving for better opportunities.” -",
