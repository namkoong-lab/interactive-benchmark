        "Review",
        "One of the reason I love Collector Books is that they have wonderful niche books that just no one else covers. Take this latest toy book, Housekeeping Toys 1870 - 1970. This paperback edition covers, what else, those play toys that simulated domestic activities such as cleaning and cooking. What immediately strikes you as you read the book is the many wonderful metal toys they USED to make as opposed to today's dull plastic toys...-Tim Janson",
