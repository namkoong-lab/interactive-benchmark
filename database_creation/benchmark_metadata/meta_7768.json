        "CHAPTER 1",
        "A Woman Has theCourage To AcknowledgeHer Strength andSet Limits",
        "Feminism called upon me to have thecourage to grow up, to discover and exercisemy womanly strength, to be unafraid of pain—andthe pain is immeasurable—knowingthat fully experienced, it makesjoy fully possible.—Sonia Johnson",
        "Our daily lives are proof of our inherent strength. We women move throughuncharted occupational territory, have and care for children, nurture othersemotionally and physically, and explore our psychological and spiritualdimensions. Although we are usually strong for others, we often feel weak andvictimized while attempting to set realistic limits that respect us asindividuals. However, every human being has limits and, if we do not honor ours,we can become overextended, resentful, and even ill. So sometimes the mostcourageous thing we can do is be aware that we can't do it all for everyone.",
        "Even when others disagree, it is important that we remember we have the right tobe strong and to say no. When we know in our hearts that it is okay for us tohonor ourselves by having limits, we can set them in a gentle way. Although itis one of the most difficult things women have to learn, often the courageousand loving thing for us to do is to acknowledge our strength and learn to sethonest limits.",
        "Imagining Ourselves Strong",
        "We all face situations in which we feel powerless and afraid. I once had aclient who was terrified of an upcoming child custody hearing. She feltintimidated by the legal system, her lawyer, and especially her ex-husband. Iasked her what it would take for her to feel safe and strong in the court room.",
        "\"Nothing short of riding in on a brahman bull!\" she answered jokingly. It was agreat idea, straight out of her inner wisdom.",
        "I had her work with the image. She had fun creating the scenario of herselfgalloping into the court on a huge, snorting bull that threatened to gore anyonewho tried to frighten her. Her day in court was a success because each time shefelt the least bit scared she visualized herself astride her bull. With the helpof her amusing but effective mental imagery she felt strong and capable. As aresult, she was treated as if she were powerful, someone not to be dismissed ormanipulated.",
        "As the story illustrates, we are all as strong as we imagine ourselves to be.When we act as if we are strong, we move towards becoming the powerful women wedesire to be. Having the courage to see ourselves as strong, capable, and wise,able to do what we need and want helps make it so. But we need not do it alone.We can move creatively through our fears by accepting support and guidance froman unseen helper, whether that is a higher power or a brahman bull.",
        "I am strong and capable.I can do whatever I set my mind to.I am filled with strength and confidence.",
        "Acting in Spite of Fear",
        "To act even though we are afraid is to be courageous. Amazingly, we do it almostevery day. If we did not do what we feared, how many of us would move to a newstate or decide to change jobs? More importantly, how many of us would begrappling with the intense need to be our own person if we were not, indeed,already courageous?",
        "For years Fiona had felt at the mercy of her husband's temper. She was terrifiedby his outbursts; faced with his fury, she would appease him, suppressing herown feelings in the hopes he would calm down. Finally, cautiously she began towork on setting limits in her relationship. She talked to a therapist and wentto Al-Anon meetings to help her have the courage to break the destructivepattern she was in with her husband. She knew she had succeeded when, on the eveof a trip to Hawaii, her husband blew up and said they were not going. Calmly,she continued to pack. With sadness but without anger, she told him she wassorry he felt as he did because she had been looking forward to a secondhoneymoon with him, but that she was going without him.",
        "Getting to that point took tremendous courage for Fiona. She faced her fears andtriumphed. Her story has a happy ending, too—her husband apologized for hisoutburst and they had a wonderful time in Hawaii.",
        "Take a moment now to focus on your courageous acts. They can be very simple. Ifyou are grieving, depressed, or otherwise in pain, it may take quite a bit ofcourage to do something as simple as getting out of bed or making dinner. Take afew moments to make a list of times when you have acted in spite of fear andthen share your list with someone you trust. We are courageous every day, but ithelps to remind us when we share our courage with others.",
        "I have the courage to act even thoughI feel afraid.I have the strength to do the thingsI need to do.",
        "Knowing We Are Not the Target",
        "We often allow ourselves to be deeply wounded by the actions of people aroundus. We feel guilty and irrationally think that it is our fault if people treatus badly. It takes courage not to do this.",
        "Sarah's father and sister were invariably doing and saying things that woundedher deeply. She felt somehow responsible for their actions and became mired inguilt. One day, while visiting the zoo, she saw a gorilla bellowing and throwingexcrement at onlookers. She realized that while she was among the crowd, shewasn't being personally targeted. Sarah decided to view the attacks of herfather and sister in the same way. Now, when Sarah finds herself believing sheis the target of her family's anger or manipulation, she pretends she is at thezoo observing another species and emotionally moves out of the line of fire.",
        "It takes strength to know that we are not to blame for the actions of others,and that we do not need to be their target. Even if people insist on projectingtheir unfinished business onto us, we can train ourselves to remember that weare not responsible for what anyone else does or says. We can learn to take thebull's eye off our chest and put it in the closet.",
        "I have the strength to know I am not the target.I know I don't need to \"fix\"anyone else's attitude or circumstances.I dodge anger that is inappropriately aimed at me.",
        "Chewing Bite-Size Pieces",
        "Many times our automatic reaction when faced with an uncomfortable or confusingsituation is to thrash around trying to change it immediately. We attempt toswallow the whole predicament at once and spit it out, solved. Very rarely doesthis approach ease our pain or alter the situation. In fact, thoughtless, quickaction is often more frustrating than productive.",
        "When baffled or upset, we need to PAUSE, take a deep breath, and have thecourage to recognize that we are intelligent and resourceful enough to solve theproblem. We can either figure out a solution ourselves or find the people tohelp us. Slowly and thoughtfully, we can then begin to explore the problem andits possible solutions in bitesize pieces. Usually, as each small piece issolved, anxiety subsides and the entire puzzle fits together more easily than wemight have feared.",
        "Who, for instance, hasn't experienced qualms of inadequacy and frustration whenfirst faced with a convoluted income tax form or an incomprehensible insuranceform? Without a small-step approach to such chores, we can feel discouragedbefore we even start. But if we pause, take a deep breath and affirm our abilityto solve our problem, then divide our task into small pieces, we can almostalways conquer whatever is in front of us.",
        "We can find what we need to solve our problems if we don't allow ourselves tobecome overwhelmed. Three little slogans we can use to remind ourselves of thisare: Pause, don't panic; this isn't an emergency; I rarely choke on bite-sizepieces.",
        "I am resourceful.I take one thing at a time in bite-size pieces.I solve problems with ease and intelligence.",
        "Putting Our White Horse out to Pasture",
        "Women tend to be habitual rescuers. We leap on our white horses at the firstsign of distress, believing that it is our job to save everyone. It isn't.",
        "I was giving a talk at our local hospice meeting about how tiring it is to getstuck in the \"rescue\" mode. One woman volunteer exhaustedly said, \"I agree, butwhat if your white horse is parked next to your husband's mule?\" This woman hadlet herself be labeled The-One-Who-Fixes-It in her marriage, and her husband wasstubbornly refusing to have it any other way. I asked her, \"Do you believe youneed to keep rescuing him?\" Her answer was a hesitant, \"Well, no, but ...\" Eventhough she was complaining, she really did believe it was her job. And ofcourse, she couldn't get out of the position until she gave up her belief.",
        "In reality, no one can rescue anyone else. Everyone must find his or her own waythrough life. However, breaking the whitehorse habit is very difficult and takescommitment on our part. We need to keep reminding ourselves that, althoughsociety has fostered the myth of woman-as-rescuer, it is invalid.",
        "As we have the courage to continually halt our white horse in mid-gallop wewill, in time, believe it is okay to do so.",
        "I know I can rescue only myself.I put my white horse out to pasture.I trust others know how best to live their lives.",
        "Crediting Our Life's Account",
        "The myriad of demands on our time and energy can leave us feeling emotionallydrained and physically exhausted. We become imbalanced when we give out morethan we take in. Because women have been taught to be givers and receiving seemsselfish to us, it takes enormous courage to see the value in allowing ourselvesto give only that which is reasonable and healthy.",
        "If your life were a bank account, how many daily deposits and withdrawals do youmake to and from the account of your body, feelings, mind, and spirit? In fact,we all do have a \"life account,\" from which we frequently make too manywithdrawals or allow others to withdraw too freely.",
        "In order to have a comfortable \"balance\" in our lives, we need to creditliberally and debit wisely. When we overdraw physically, emotionally, mentally,or spiritually, we \"see red\"; i.e., we experience frustration, anger, andexhaustion. But when we credit our life's account by setting realistic limits,we have more to give. Although taking care of ourselves is often difficult todo, it is an excellent investment in creating the quality of life we want anddeserve. By taking the time to nurture ourselves, we ensure that we will not get\"overdrawn.\"",
        "I credit my \"life account\"by setting realistic limits.I have the courage to decidewhat I will give and what I will not give.My life is blessedby balance and harmony.",
        "KISSING Our Life",
        "\"Yes\" is a little word, but it can lead to lots of complications in our lives ifwe use it too liberally. Saying \"No\" is particularly hard for women because wefeel guilty turning down requests or demands. We want to live up to our own andothers' expectations, even if they are unreasonable.",
        "How often do you find yourself overwhelmed by more commitments than you cancomfortably handle, wondering, \"Why did I say 'Yes' to this commitment? I knew Ididn't really want to do it.\" One of the biggest reasons we say \"Yes\" is becausewe don't honor our limits—many of us aren't even aware of them until it's toolate. But we all need to give ourselves permission to be aware of our limits, tolisten to the inner warnings as they come, and then honor our wisdom by saying\"No.\" One way to begin to do this is to implement the old KISS philosophy ofKeep It Simple, Sweetie. Say \"No\" to complexity and \"Yes\" to simplicity in yourlife. Complexity is exhausting and fragmenting while simplicity is energizingand centering.",
        "Write a list of ways you can simplify your life. What obligations can youdelegate to others, give up altogether, or modify in order to be comfortablewith your commitments and feel you have not overstepped your limits? Gentlyclose your eyes and visualize yourself living more simply. Having weeded outunnecessary responsibilities and commitments from your schedule, think of thingsyou find nourishing, such as solitude, friendship, or romance, and visualizeyourself enjoying them. We deserve to have a simply beautiful life.",
        "I am aware of my limits and I honor them.I give myself permission to keep my life simple.I create the time to do things which nourish me.",
        "Saying \"No\" without Feeling Guilty",
        "What in the world impels us to say \"Yes\" when we feel \"No\"? We think we should.We're afraid of what they will think of us if we don't do what they want.",
        "Vickie tearfully lamented to me, \"I knew it wouldn't work when Jack (herhusband) asked if he could come to work for me. Now he's there and I hate it!Why did I say \"Yes?\" Vickie had been taught to feel guilty if she refused arequest. She is not alone—we women have been brainwashed to ignore what we feelis right for us if it doesn't comply with what others want. That's why it takesa lot of courage to stand up for ourselves and set limits; if we don't we canend up filled with regret and resentment, as Vickie did.",
        "Even though we are afraid of disappointing others, when we really feel we have aright to say \"No\" and say it with full awareness of that right, people usuallythink it's just fine. For when we expect people to accept our No's and to honorour limits, they generally do. Our conviction that we have the right to chooseto say \"No\" comes across and is accepted.",
        "So we need to respectfully pay attention to ourselves, tuning in when the littlevoice inside wants to say \"No.\" We are our own best experts. We can replace ourdraining shoulds with empowering words like can, want to, choose to, or will.",
        "I have the right to say \"No\"without feeling guilty.I have the courage to say \"No\"without feeling guilty.I pay attention to what I know is right for me.",
        "Retiring Aunt Jemima",
        "Lurking in the subconscious of some women is the archaic belief that as a woman,wife, and mother, our proper role is willing servant to our families. Mindy cameface to face with her hidden belief about the role she felt she played when shesaw her family's Christmas photo. The idea had been for each family member todress in outfits that indicated one of their main interests. The children weredressed in sports uniforms or theatrical costumes, and her husband wore hisjogging togs. Mindy had chosen Aunt Jemima. She thought she dressed as a slavefor a joke, but, after seeing the picture and thinking about her reasons forchoosing as she did, she became aware that she really did feel like a slave. Andshe began to comprehend how resentful she felt as a result.",
        "Realizing the role she had allowed herself to slip into was a turning point inher life. She decided to send Aunt Jemima into retirement. She began affirmingthat she deserved to be her own person. As that belief took hold, she was ableto set firm limits about how much she would do for everyone and stick with them.She also began seriously to pursue her career. It wasn't easy, but the eventualbonus for Mindy and her family was that she began to feel more loving and givingas she gave up her slave role and became committed to having a life of her own.",
        "It takes courage to retire Aunt Jemima and give ourselves permission to do whatwe choose to do rather than what we feel we have to do. As we gather thestrength to give up living under the tyranny of our shoulds, we will feel moreloving, and our giving will not be laced with resentment. We have the right toset limits and have lives of our own.",
        "I have the right to set limitsand the courage to do so.Setting reasonable limitsmakes me more loving to myself and my family.",
        "Teaching Others How to Treat Us",
        "A burdensome problem many of us have is the inability to accept our own worth.At some deep level we believe that we are not worthy of success, happiness, orsupportive and loving relationships.",
        "There is an old adage that \"we teach people how to treat us.\" Do you teach thosearound you to treat you with respect or disrespect? When we believe we areunworthy, others treat us accordingly, but when we believe we are worthy ofbeing treated well, we will accept nothing less. Inherently, we are worthy—ourchallenge is to know that and treat ourselves as we want others to treat us.",
