        "Lions live in a world of grassy plains. To dolphins, the world is water. Lush green trees make up gorillas' world. And yet, all these animals share the same world. This is the point artist Schim Schimmel makes over and over and over in",
        "The Family of Earth",
        ": \"The earth may look different to each of us, but we share only one earth.\" Through his surrealistic acrylic paintings of leopards, penguins, hippos, and gorillas, each in their appropriate landscape (or floating in space with the moon and stars and planet Earth hovering nearby), the author-illustrator expresses his beliefs about planetary interdependence. Schimmel describes his paintings as Environmental Visionary Surrealism, and hopes to change the way readers see the world, with intriguing lines like, \"Leopards do not swim with dolphins. They have never seen a penguin.\" Although heavy-handed,",

        "reS-Gr 3-This title features Schimmel's \"eco-surreal\" artwork, which suggests the interdependence of all of Earth's creatures. The text attempts to describe the perspectives experienced by a variety of animals. For example, snow leopards don't see the same environment as dolphins. Gorillas call the forest home while lions live on the grassy plains. The point of the narrative is that although all of the creatures live in different habitats, they all inhabit the same planet. Unfortunately, the reiteration of the theme becomes monotonous after several pages. The striking acrylic paintings are minutely detailed and the animals are incredibly realistic, if a bit romanticized. This is a lovely browsing item, but other, less message-driven books on wildlife and conservation might be more useful.",

Schimmel began showing his fine-art in Japan in 1991. In 1992 one of Japan\\'s largest book publishers, Shogakukan, asked Schimmel if he would be interested in writing a children\\'s book. \"Dear Children of the Earth, A Letter from Home,\" was released in 1993 in Japan, and published the following year in the United States.', \"Since then, three more children's books by Schim Schimmel have been published: Children of the Earth...Remember; The Family of Earth; and his newest book, The Butterfly's Treasure. In addition, three books of Schimmel's collected artworks have been published, two in Japan and one in the United States.\", 'Schim Schimmel communicates a simple yet profound message through his artwork and writing--the need to cherish and protect this world. In his words, \"It is so easy with our complicated, busy, sometimes difficult lives to forget just how magnificent, how miraculous our planet earth truly is. It is equally easy to forget that we do not own, but share this planet with all its many life-forms. As an artist and writer, my desire is to remind all of us that we are responsible for the well being of this world.\"', 'Today, Schim Schimmel and Kirk Smith own their own fine-art/book publishing company--SchimmelSmith Publishing, located in Burbank, California. Schimmel continues to travel to Japan every year to attend exhibitions of his artwork.']}"
