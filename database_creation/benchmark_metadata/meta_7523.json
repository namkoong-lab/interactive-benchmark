        "Form",
        "is the first volume in a new art instruction series from Barronï¿½s focusing on several different approaches to creating imaginative, finished, highly professional paintings. The titles in this series are designed for use by advanced students and experienced amateurs. A paintingï¿½s form is the element that lends it visual coherence, and form derives from combinations of shapes as simple as triangles, circles, and squares, or as complex as intersecting lines and overlapping irregular shapes intended to suggest motion, perspective, repose, or very many other qualities. This title shows examples of still life, portraits, landscapes, water scenes, skies, and even abstract paintings, then analyzes these works, demonstrating in clear illustrations the fundamental shapes from which each painting is constructed. Examples include works by famous artists, among them, Leonardo da Vinci, Joshua Reynolds, Vincent Van Gogh, Edvard Munch, Joan Mirï¿½, Wassily Kandinsky, and many others. Vivid and instructive color illustrations on every page."
