        "I",
        "am the person writing this book, a book specifically about how to introduce new foods to picky toddlers; a book that unravels toddler development and essentially explains to parents why almost every toddler is hardwired to be “picky”; a book that urges frantic parents to keep calm, cool, and collected at all times in regard to feeding—despite how much food your tot actually swallows; a book that",
        "in essence",
        "reminds you that feeding is not perfect—and that it’s OK to have the meals that are, well, less than perfect. All I can say is that I am glad our dinnertime tonight was not broadcast on YouTube for the world of potential readers to view as both my son Jake, now seven, and my daughter Maggie, just four, looked at me in utter disbelief that I made ravioli—with something other than cheese on the inside.",
        "At first mortified at the thought of someone witnessing this scene, I quickly stopped to wonder—what if dinnertime at my house was on YouTube tonight? Could it be a good thing?",
        "Watching me, mother first, pediatric dietitian last, fall into coaxing both of my children to “just take a bite” and try this Martian ravioli. (For the record, it was pesto, and it seemed like a good thing to buy at the time.)",
        "Watching my son Jake spit out his pesto ravioli—properly on a napkin, thank you very much—moaning in sheer despair as his taste buds registered “unfamiliar flavor: get it out!” (I prayed the neighbors were all inside as he carried on like a wounded animal on prime time Discovery. I mean really, I can’t help but wonder what would have happened if they were portobello-stuffed…)",
        "Laughing all the while as my daughter Maggie, surprisingly very willing to try new foods, takes a bite, scrapes it off her tongue, and declares, “These are disgusting!”",
        "And could it really be a good thing, considering the preacher of family dinners is missing a very important someone at the dinner table (scandalous!) on this particular night, that someone being Dad?",
        "So far, this YouTube possibility seems like a bad idea—maybe even awful.",
        "BUT WHAT IF I ASKED IF YOU NOTICED…",
        "…How the coaxing was short-lived, as I pulled my professional self together and tried desperately to remain neutral for the rest of dinner by eloquently redirecting conversation about what went on during the day.",
        "…How Jake went about the meal and declared he was going to eat only his broccoli, meatballs, and garlic bread on his plate—but not",
        "those ravioli",
        ". Fine by me, I thought quietly in my head, resisting my desire to applaud his decision.",
        "…How Maggie, following in her older brother’s footsteps, chose to eat the part of her meal she liked as well: one and a half small meatballs, equal to a ping pong ball, giving her just about all the protein she needed for the whole day, with three small trees of broccoli (check one serving of veggie), and the squishy inside of three thinly sliced pieces of garlic bread (check carbohydrate). All washed down with about a quarter cup of 1% organic milk.",
        "AND YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN…",
        "The three of us shuffling out to the car and racing toward hockey practice, where we find Jake’s coach, Dad, anxiously waiting to lace up his skates in locker room number three.",
        "Though it was a bit hectic, I hope you can see the small successes of that particular meal—because we all know the outcome could have been a lot worse. For me, my goals were met. I felt good about what my kids ate, how much they ate, how they were sitting down to eat, and most importantly, how we got to spend that twenty minutes (OK, maybe fifteen) sitting at the table—together.",
        "Even though I am a registered dietitian, just like you I am constantly in search of the perfect balance between the dos and the don’ts of feeding a family—especially the ever-challenging toddler.",

        "WHY WRITE A BOOK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TODDLER NUTRITION?",
        "As a registered dietitian (RD) and a specialist in pediatric nutrition, I take care of infants and children throughout all stages of the life cycle. Toddlers, who will be defined for the purposes of this book as ages one to three years, are some of the most vivacious yet demanding creatures on Earth. One minute they’re your friend; in a nanosecond, they’re your enemy—often for what appears to be no good reason at all. It has taken me twelve years of working in this field and having two children to understand that feeding a toddler is ten percent about actual food and nutrition and ninety percent about parenting. Through my work and home life, I have come to fully understand that feeding a toddler and parenting go hand in hand, and I am excited to share some of the secrets I have learned about toddlers that will make feeding during this life stage more enjoyable—for everyone.",
        "Having been fortunate enough to work with hundreds of families at some of the preeminent pediatric hospitals in the nation, I have developed a tremendous understanding of what makes children grow—even under the direst of circumstances. At the beginning of my career, I worked with undernourished, critically ill children where I saw firsthand what a task it was for them to eat. I was committed to making it easier for sick children to gain or sustain their body weight. I counted endless calories and grams of protein and trained myself to write prescriptions for how much food was enough. Once my career path changed and I began to work with young children who were not critically ill, a specific population of “troubled eaters” quickly surfaced with each consultation. Most were toddlers who were simply driving their parents mad with each and every bite of food (or lack thereof!). I soon realized that the one- to three-year-olds I saw for “feeding difficulties” typically fell into one of the following four categories.",
        "1. Grazers",
        "Toddlers who were offered food, milk, or juice whenever they asked for it because",
        "a) their parents had been told that their tot’s weight was faltering a bit from the growth curve;",
        "OR",
        "b) parental perception of how much food their toddler",
        "should",
        "be eating versus how much the toddler actually ate.",
        "Well-intended parents were often more exhausted from trying to get their toddler to eat than from the toddler himself. In many cases, parents were confessing to me that they were leaving random snacks around the house (e.g., Goldfish crackers on the coffee table, the remainder of breakfast on the table right up until lunchtime) and toting snacks just about everywhere in case the toddler got hungry. After taking countless diet histories from families and listening to endless feeding schedules, it became evident that the grazers were able to eat just enough food every one to two hours to squelch their hunger cues and keep their blood sugar in check, but never really had the chance to develop physical hunger to eat enough food at mealtimes. So, when breakfast, lunch, or dinner rolled around, there was zero motivation to come sit down and eat, and if the toddler",
        "did",
        "make an attempt to eat (usually after a battle of wills), only a few bites of food were consumed. The result? Parents felt that their toddlers “ate nothing!”",
        "Secret #1: Toddlers need very small amounts of food to grow and thrive. After the first year of life, their growth rapidly slows down and their calorie needs decrease. From birth to one year of age, an infant will essentially triple his or her birth weight. A toddler’s rate of growth is much slower. A two-year-old may gain only four pounds by the time he or she is three, which is only about 15 percent of his or her body weight.",
        "2. Excess Empty-Calorie Consumers",
        "It has become increasingly clear that in today’s very hectic lifestyle, parents are frustrated with their toddler’s ability to eat foods from the family table. So many families neglect cooking meals for a lot of reasons: lack of interest, time, and patience, particularly with young toddlers in the home; when effort is put into cooking and the toddler doesn’t eat, the line seems to be drawn—in concrete. So many parents come into the office starting the conversation with the same sentence: “He just won’t eat what we eat.” When probed, the story would go something like this: “He only ate a few bites of baked chicken and maybe a few spoonfuls of carrots, so I made him a hot dog.” As time went on, I came to understand that parents feel compelled to feed their toddler “something” at every meal, so they resort to feeding junk or snack-type foods if the toddler doesn’t appear to eat enough table food, or what I like to refer to in this book as",
        "proper food",
        ".",
        "Secret #2: Toddler development is unique when it comes to feeding and food choices. Let’s think about the first six months of an infant’s life: she is essentially on a liquid diet; she eats, sleeps, and poops; developmentally, she is working on trust and is relatively immobile. For the most part, she can be contained in a high chair and is willing to consume what she is given. When she reaches toddlerhood, she is learning to talk and walk, which means she is able to say no with authority and can hop down from the table at any given moment (if allowed), not to mention working tirelessly at learning to feed herself. This new person can’t help but offer her opinion when she has the chance and takes every opportunity to express how she feels—simply because she can. This is quite a change from the relative ease of feeding a snuggly baby around the clock every three to four hours in response to a simple cry. Couple this with the transition from jarred baby food in perfectly portioned containers labeled with calories, and ..."
