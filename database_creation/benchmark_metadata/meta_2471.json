        "“ ‘Where does someone go to hear from God in this place?’The bookseller stared blankly back at me.So, I revised my question: ‘If I came in here troubled about what’s happening, and wanted to know how to be okay with God, where would you direct me?’The clerk led me back to a corner where I found several books about living off the grid. As he left me there I realized he must have missed the God part of my question…”So begins one author’s investigation into what’s available for solid answers. She takes us into her own journey from a shattering grief to a search for truth. And then, in spite of many-layered hesitations a real exposure into what the Bible has to say about these things. The words there reveal the Voice, and His voice can change your life.Nees continues, “Have you ever wondered if the One called God were to speak or to write…and if He presumably cared to send a message into our troubled planet, what format would He use? Would He join the bazaar? Or would He hide out in a desert waiting for the hardier souls to find Him? And even if He could make sound wave echoes through time and across continents, would my ears be able to tune into His frequency?”“I am going to start with a pretty safe assumption: you’ve already concluded that if He is reliable, and if He has really spoken, you might want to listen. Then, I’m going to lay all my cards on the table right here and say that He has spoken; and, what’s more, He is still speaking.”This seven-chapter book, highlighted like a trail guide with Markers, will ease you into most basic, repeated themes found in the ancient texts. What is called the Old and New Testaments is a remarkable collection. It is intimidating for sure, but wise, prophetic, thorough and particular, with echoes that repeat into every culture. Through story and turn-arounds you will see how some very different individuals, in different times found their way into God’s real and sustaining peace. They listened to and reckoned with what God offers for soul survival. There’s hope here if you'll take it. Jeremiah, the Hebrew prophet scanned the options in his own time and summarized it this way: “Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; and you will find rest for your souls.”"

We were both 19 and pretty dumb. It was shortly after that trip that I decided that going along for the ride, any ride, was even dumber. Now my preferred mode of travel is walking. Deliberately. With eyes wide open. And so, it is of interest to me that “walking”, even “walking with God” is a thing in the Bible. Such travel is described of a few folks early on in Genesis, intimated in the middle of the ancient collection of writings, and encouraged for anyone near the end. To walk with God is a possibility then—practiced through the whole remarkable book by folks just as messed up as we are. To consider such a beckoning travel partner as God could be life changing for you too. The Bible is itself a journey through time and cultures. From its beginning, there are key themes that echo: through the books of Moses, the histories, then the warnings of the prophets culminating in Jesus’ crucial sacrifice to the unfolding in Revelation. Markers provides one trail guide into the ancient words that reveal how one can walk deliberately, eyes wide open—with God.\"', 'Mary is a retired Art History instructor, a practicing artist and a life-long learner. She trained at Cornell University, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and earned her MFA at East Tennessee State University.']}"
