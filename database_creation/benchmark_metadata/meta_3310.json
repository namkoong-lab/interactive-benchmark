The World's #1 Olive Oil Brand For over 150 years, Bertolli has remained dedicated to crafting the highest quality olive oil on the market. In 1865, our founders, Francesco and Caterina Bertolli, started a store beneath their home selling local Tuscan wines, cheeses, olives and olive oils. Italian immigrants began asking the Bertollis to send their olive oil to America, and soon, Bertolli had become a pioneer exporter of olive oil. Our commitment to purity, timelessness and integrity are the reason we've been able to bring Tuscan-inspired culinary experiences to food lovers around the world for more than a century and a half."
