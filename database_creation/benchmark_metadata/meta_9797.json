        "Why you need fabric grow bags",
        "?  NvVn fabric grow bags readily breathe, Compared to the compacted soil in traditional plastic pot, the soil in our smart pots (benefited from the breathable fabric) have incredible aeration to allow air, water and nutrients to penetrate the plant roots. This helps the roots grow deeply and produce a stronger, more vigorous plant.",
        "How air pruning works",
        "?  Air pruning happens naturally when roots are exposed to air in the absence of high humidity. The roots are effectively “burned” off, causing the plant to constantly produce new and healthy branching roots. If roots are not exposed to air, they continue to grow around the container in a constricted pattern.",
        "Is it really effective for increasing yield",
        "?  Air-pruning occurs naturally when your plant’s roots hit the edge of the aeration fabric pot by detecting air. resulting more opportunities to uptake food & nutrients to grow stronger, healthier and yield better."
