        "Survival of the fittest starts with the best fit. Husky X-act Contour liners combine laserscanned, exact fit with a no-slip, DuraGrip surface and a softer feel. It’s the highest evolution of the same grit-tough durability that’s gone into the Husky brand since 1988. Built for abuse that would curl the edges of lesser liners. It locks to your vehicle’s factory retention posts, with the added stability of our Stay-Put Nibs for a no-slip, no-slide, surface with absolutely zero compromise in protection. They’re made to stand up to whatever you’re laying down— including chemicals like battery acid and oil, with our FormFit Edge to keep spills contained for easy cleanup. Just remove, spray, and they’re back on the job. Available in black. Built to last a lifetime, warrantied the same. Right here in Winfield, Kansas, America."
