        "How to Start, Run & Grow a Million Dollar Success From Home!",
        "In this book, I don’t tell you how to make beautiful candles in few steps and then give you a few recipes to try, so you can start your own Candle making business. You can find that information anywhere, don’t have to buy my book to learn that. Wait! Oh! I did that in this book. I did explain how to make Beautiful Candles, I also did give you a few simple recipes too. But I hope that is not why you bought this book.",
        "In this book my goal is to explain to you in simple terms how to CREATE great natural and organic candles and not just MAKE any candles, there is a difference. You will get to see and understand that difference when you understand each ingredients and how they interact and react with each other.",
        "You will not have a great business if you are just making carbon copy of few candles of other people which your customers can go buy from any local stores. What will make you unique is when you create a blend or two of your own and people start liking your creation. That is when you can hit the home run in business.",
        "Imagine growing your candle company into a local, regional and ultimately a national brand, where your candles will be sold at every Whole food, Body, Bath and Beyond, Home Goods and many other great retailers.",
        "This is a two part book. In the first part I show you how to get started with candle making, I show you every steps you need to take to make your first batch of candle. Then I show you how to test your creation and how to figure out what works and what does not.",
        "On the second part of the book, I teach you everything you need to know about turning your new found passion into a successful business. In my last book, “Soap Making Business Start Up” I shared how I grew that business from 0 to a six figure business and then sold it for a good profit. If you have read that book than you know dream are not just dreams, they can become a reality with some dedication, focus and hard work. I think you may find it inspiring that an average housewife like myself was able to build the business and then was able to sell it for a good profit.",

        "\"This is a great resource for anyone that wants to get started in the candle making business or even if they want to try it as a hobby. In this book, she goes into a lot of details about how to start making candles at home. But what makes this book unique is her passion to turn it into a big business, as she has done that with her soap business. Follow your passion",

        "I am Suzanne Carpenter; I always had a dream about making beautiful soaps and candles and have a successful business where people would see my soaps and candles on store shelves and know right away that it came from me. I was able to make that into a reality, well for the most part, other than the personal recognition part.",
        "Thought the process was extremely tedious and difficult especially since I didn't know much about starting a business. Only passion I ever had was to make beautiful soaps and candles, boy! I made some great ones. But soon after starting to build my business I realized, making soaps or candles are totally different than making them into a full blow business.",
        "The learning curve was steep, and I was determined to make a go of it even if that meant I would have to sacrifice whatever I had. I took me two long years to finally be able to break through all the walls and see success. I build my business from zero to a 6 figure business in 26 months which is in little over two years' time.",
        "By then I figured out the Ins and Outs of this business and had a great distribution channel set up who were helping to market my soap all over the country. My soaps were mostly selling in boutique shops, some TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods and even in few Whole Foods market.",
        "One day I got a call from an agent who was representing a name brand soap company and they expressed interest in buying my business. After three months of hard negotiation and planning, I was able to sell them my company for a good price.",
        "Since I can't make soap anymore, I started on my other passion, which making beautiful unique candles. Since I shared my soap making passion in the previous book, I have decided to share my Candle passion and the \"know how\" so if any of you are looking to get started, you don't have to go through what I have gone through and waste two years trying to make a go of it."
