        "Mara honors the memory of her Grandmother and the struggles of other family members by donating one dollar from the sale of every album to benefit breast cancer research. Mara's original acoustic rock with soul showcases classic songwriting sensibility reared on modern pop radio. In 2001, Mara was nominated by the LA Music Awards as 'Best Female Singer/Songwriter' and secured a coveted spot on Music Connection Magazine's 'Hot 100 Unsigned Artists' list. Her songs have been featured in independent film, on national television and on compilation CDs from MP3.com (Mara's song 'Don't Let Me Run' was #1 on their acoustic charts) and GuitarGirls.com. Mara's debut album on Flying Coaster Records, It's Who I Am, is an upbeat collection of positive songwriting and melodic hooks. The overall theme of finding your place in the world and being comfortable with your own self-image has struck a chord with diverse audiences of all ages. Mara (pronounced like marathon) is a native New Yorker currently living in Los Angeles while touring colleges, popular clubs, coffeehouses, youth hostels and seasonal festivals as well as private engagements. Her dynamic, soulful vocals and captivating stage presence reflect her musical theater roots and keep her loyal and growing following coming back to her live shows (and bringing friends!) at home and around the world. Mara jump-started her career playing in the pubs of Scotland for a ravenous following of international travelers and loyal locals who persuaded her to come back for the Edinburgh Festival. Within two months, she was playing five packed nights a week, selling (and signing) all available copies of her acoustic EP, accepting invitations for live radio appearances and enjoying life as a featured performer in the Fringe Festival. Fans who discovered her there have continued to support her music to this day in countries around the world and at home. Mara's music has proven to know no language or cultural barriers."
