        "\"Fink's ability to overcome the Youngs' code of Scottish-Australian omertà is impressive... a cut above other AC/DC tomes, and Fink knows it.\"",

        "9/10 review\"An entertaining book... fans of the band will want to get their hands on this. Pronto.\"",
        "- Booklist (American Library Association)",
        "\"A fascinating, insightful look at the brothers who changed the face of rock 'n' roll and the politics and business that goes hand in hand with the music we all know and love.\"",
        "- Jimmy Stafford, guitarist of Train",
        "\"It's extraordinarily well written and presents a fascinating view of the band and the people that helped make it happen... a great piece of research and magnificently presented.\"",
        "- Phil Carson, former vice-president of Atlantic Records who signed AC/DC",
        "\"A largely untold, more controversial story... anything but a hagiography. A fresh, incisive take on the band.\"",
        "- MOJO (UK)",
        "★ ★ ★ ★ (four-star review)\"An essential read for fans of the band... a full portrait of just how significant a role George Young, Malcolm and Angus's older brother, played in AC/DC's development.\"",
        "- The New Yorker",
        "\"Until a band member puts pen to paper in a proper tell-all exposé - they won't - Jesse Fink's work here is the number one go-to book on the subject, warts 'n' all.\"",
        "- Uber Rock (UK)",
        "\"Fink's look at the band addresses the question that he believes most mainstream rock critics have never been able to answer about AC/DC: 'Why have they endured and resonated with hundreds of millions of people and inculcated such fierce loyalty and outright fanaticism?' The answer is the unrelenting tenacity of the Young brothers... fascinating.\"",
        "- Publishers Weekly",
        "\"This thought-provoking book definitely breaks some new ground. Arrangement by chapters dedicated to specific songs is a satisfying way of telling the AC/DC story while providing music criticism. Scholarly fans will appreciate the bibliography. This one's a must-read for fans.\"",

        "\"A great narrative... it has one very simple, very powerful message for those who would like to dismiss AC/DC as childish hacks: 'Stop being so bloody pretentious!'\"",

        "With sales of over 200 million albums, AC/DC is not just the biggest rock band in the world. It's a family business built by three brothers: George, Malcolm and Angus Young. And, as with any business, some people prospered while others got hurt along the way. The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC is unlike any AC/DC book you've read before. Less a biography, more a critical appreciation, it tells the story of the trio through 11 classic songs and reveals some of the secrets that went into their making. Important figures from AC/DC's long way to the top open up for the very first time, while unsung heroes behind the bands success are given the credit they are due. Accepted accounts of events are challenged while sensational details emerge to cast a whole new light on the bands history, especially their early years with Atlantic Records. Former AC/DC members and musicians from bands such as Guns N' Roses, Dropkick Murphys, Airbourne and Rose Tattoo also give their take on the Youngs' brand of magic. Their music has never pulled its punches. Neither does The Youngs. After 40 years, AC/DC might just have got the serious book it deserves."

        "\"The best book I've ever read about AC/DC.\"-",
        "Mark Evans (AC/DC, 1975-'77)",
        "\"A savvy new book... Fink, quite properly, can't stand the kind of music critic who feels pleasing a crowd is a suspect achievement, somehow antithetical to the spirit of rock. In the end, [he] seems to be in two minds about AC/DC. That seems the right number of minds for an adult to be in about them, especially an adult who encountered their best albums during the sweet spot of his youth.\"-",
        "The Australian",
        "\"Recent books [about AC/DC]... didn't offer much to change our perception of the band. Jesse Fink's study of the Young brothers takes a different approach... giving us a different version of many stories, especially when it comes to the wheeling and dealing behind the rock. Fink is clearly in love with AC/DC, but he knows the old bird has some warts under her make-up, and doesn't shy away from revelations that cast the Youngs in a less than flattering light.\"-",
