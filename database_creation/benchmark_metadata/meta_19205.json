        "The 410 stainless steel thread cutting screw has a plain finish, a Type F point style, and a pan head with a Phillips drive. The type F point is suitable for heavy gauge sheet metal, aluminum, cast iron, brass, and plastic. The screw has machine screw threads that taper down to a blunt point with multiple cutting edges and chip cavities. The 410 stainless steel material offers high strength and hardness, and resists corrosion in mild environments. The material is magnetic. The pan head has a flat top and short vertical sides with a rounded top edge. The Phillips drive has an x-shaped slot that accepts a Phillips driver and is designed to allow the driver to slip out of the head to help prevent over-tightening and damage to the thread or fastener.",
        "Thread cutting and thread rolling screws, two types of self-tapping screws, are threaded fasteners that create a mating thread in the wall of a hole. The two screws differ from each other in the way that they create the threads. Thread cutting screws cut the wall of the hole to create the thread, creating material chips that need to be cleared away from the hole to prevent clogging. Thread rolling screws, also called thread forming screws, do not remove material but instead press against the wall of the hole to displace the material and form the threads."
