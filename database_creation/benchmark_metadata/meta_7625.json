Readers take away an example of what an American patriot and loyal family man looks like, traits they should strive for to be a better person. I recommend people read this book to either reminisce on past military campaigns and identify traits of superior leadership to help them grow in their profession. --Maggie Carter"

        "Review",
        "Cutshall, who has previously written self-help material, shows here her skills as a sensitive, organized wordsmith, combining personal recollections with some pertinent historical data in this finely honed posthumous biography. Though necessarily poignant, her account is not without humor. --Barbara Bamberger ScottThe book arrived today, and Harry and I are passing it back and forth, reading snippets. I cannot read it without big tears streaming down my cheeks. Having lost my dad recently, it hit me twice as hard. After my own dad, Jean-Luc was just the greatest man I ever met. --Ginny ShawAn inspiring story of military service, family, loyalty, courage, leadership, and honor.
