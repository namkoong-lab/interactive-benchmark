        "How do we create a health care system that includes every citizen, improves health outcomes, and reins in escalating costs? Dr. McCan shows how the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), called \"Obamacare\" by some, addresses these three fundamental concerns.  Learn about the most far-reaching legislation of our time--as important for every American as Medicare is for senior citizens. Understand how the reforms build on the existing components of our system and provide for continuous improvement. Appreciate the political context and background of the legislation. Learn about and compare other countries' health care systems with our own. Consider the moral issues. Help prevent co-option of the reform legislation by special interests. Examine the Republican response. Detect misinformation and duplicity. Share a vision of how we can create a more humane and sustainable society.  Dr. McCan presents complex information in a clear, factual, yet highly engaging way. He invites citizens to become informed and serve as advocates. He reminds them that a Republican victory in November would probably lead to repeal of this historic and live-giving legislation."
