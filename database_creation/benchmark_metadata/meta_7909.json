        "Agnes Crandall's problems are rolling to a boil. First, a dog-napper invades her kitchen, seriously hampering her attempts to put on a wedding that she's staked her entire net worth on. Then a man climbs through her bedroom window to save her. \"Shane\" (no last name) may be Agnes's hero, but he's also a professional hitman―so he's no stranger to trouble himself…",
        "Between a rival who wants to take him out and an uncle who may have lost five million bucks in Agnes's basement, Shane's plate is plenty full. Soon Agnes and Shane are tangled up with the lowlifes after the money, a gang of Southern mob wedding guests, a dog named Rhett, and―most dangerous of all―each other."
