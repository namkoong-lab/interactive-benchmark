        "Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna from fresh, Non-GMO, sustainably farmed coconuts is an incredibly tasty, whole food treat made of pure coconut flesh. You can enjoy this coconut butter straight from the jar, or warm it up to spread the goodness! This tropical melt-in-your-mouth treat is rich in lauric acid and medium chain Triglycerides (MCTs), making it one of the world's most nourishing and versatile superfoods. Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna starts by sustainably harvesting organic, Non-GMO Southeast Asian coconuts. Immediately after harvest, the fresh, creamy, white meat of the coconut is scooped out of the shell by hand and pureed using a USDA Certified organic process-neverr hexane or other dangerous chemicals. The result is coconut butter with the creamy, fresh flavor of pure coconut. This aromatic, flavorful, and versatile spread is solid at cooler Temperatures and becomes spreadable when warmed. It's perfect in smoothies, sauces, desserts and baked goods. Nutiva’s organic coconut Manna is a healthful addition to vegetarian, vegan, whole food, paleo, ketogenic, and gluten-free diets. Nutiva was founded in 1999 with a single purpose in mind - to revolutionize the way the world Eats. Our role is to produce and promote organic, nutrient dense superfoods that are good for you and good for the planet. Social and environmental responsibility is a core part of Nutiva’s culture and business. From sourcing organic products, to obtaining fair Trade certification, to greening our facilities and operations, to funding tree planting at schools in our local community, we are constantly seeking ways to better protect our environment and ensure a better quality of life for employees, customers, and the communities we serve."
