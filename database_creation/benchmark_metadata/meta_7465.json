        "Thelema is one of the most powerful and influential systems of magick the world has ever known. But to truly understand the philosophy and practice of Thelema, you need to understand its charismatic founder, Aleister Crowley.",
        "Thelema",
        "reveals this enigmatic figure in all of his provocative and brilliant glory, providing a biography of Crowley and showing how his work evolved to become a paradigm-shifting system of magick. This book also explores the texts and writings that form the basis of Thelema, and it provides step-by-step instructions for practicing the basic rites and rituals of this often-misunderstood tradition.",
        "Thelema",
        "provides a multifaceted method for spiritual attainment that focuses on manifesting your true will. Discover how Crowley developed his remarkable techniques, and learn how to begin or deepen your own magical practice with elements of Qabalah, Gnosticism, Eastern philosophy, Egyptian spirituality, tarot, and more. Along the way, you'll learn about Crowley's involvement in the Golden Dawn and the O.T.O., his clandestine activities during both world wars, and the nature and influence of his personal relationships.",
