        "Over the last three decades our team of candle artisans has worked to create high quality candles for people to enjoy in their own homes. We now are very excited to present our newest line of candles made with 100% soybean wax. It has taken two full years to develop the formulations that enable us to pour container jars using 100% soybean wax combined with aromatic oils so the wax and fragrance do not separate. We do not use a soybean wax \"blend\" as most other \"soy candle\" manufacturers do. If a candle doesn't say \"made with 100% soybean wax,\" chances are the candle is made with a blend of 25% soybean wax and 75% petroleum wax. Squire Boone Village started making candles in 1979 to show visitors how the early pioneer settlers of our country made their own candles. Squire Boone Caverns and Village is a real place located in Southern Indiana and is a real place celebrating the life of Squire Boone, younger brother of Daniel. Visitors can step back in time to the late 1700s and see Squire's Grist Mill grind corn, watch soap being made from rendered hog fat, and marvel at how hard it was for the early pioneers to make their own candles. Visitors can also step back in time another million years at the Village and go underground through the caverns that once saved Squire Boone's life from a small tribe of Indians that were in his pursuit."
