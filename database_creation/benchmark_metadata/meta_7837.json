        "\"Fascinating puzzle book of brain teasers for all ages and educational backgrounds. Challenging and lighthearted. Are You Smart, or What? is the perfect gift book. Highly recommended.\" -- Jim Cox, The Midwest Book Review \"I love puzzles and this is one of the greatest word game books I have ever read. Lighthearted and fun it still proved challenging. The answers are basic and obvious but somehow often elude the reader. When I could not figure one out and had to look at the answer it was always followed with a groan as I realized that I had overlooked the obvious. A great gift idea that the whole family will enjoy, I highly recommend this book.\" -- Harold McFarland, Amazon Top 50 Reviewer\"This book's puzzles are so good they should be read with gloves. Why? They'll help protect the readers who'll slap their foreheads and yell \"God! How could I miss that!\"\" --Erik Stetson, Soundings (Virginia Military Newspapers)\"The perfect gift book for that special someone who thinks he/she is the brainiac of the group. Very cleverly laid out answers uniquely concealed in the book.\" -- Eric Dondero, Independent Publishing Reviews\"This is a fun book that can be enjoyed by the whole family.\" -- The Nashville News (Nashville, TN)\"It's a great book for couples, and family fun. Everyone can participate.\" -- The Courier Times (Sutherland, NE)\"Battaglia, a former rocket scientist, has put together a collection of clever challenges with surprising answers and amusing features. But unlike rocket science, the games are easy to understand and are fun for readers of all ages.\" -- Modesto Bee (Modesto, CA)\"Dr. Fun's book, \"Are You Smart or What?\" is guaranteed to keep your kids occupied and entertained during even the longest road trip. Great word games and challenges - even (or especially for) adults!\" -- Marisa D'Vari, Author/Consultant/Speaker",

His unique brand of brain teasers has challenged and amused readers across America. He is a former rocket scientist who helped develop rockets used in the USA's space program to get man on the moon. However, his puzzles are definitely not rocket science.\", 'Cleverness is one the distinctive features of his word games. His puzzles are devised to be tantalizingly challenging, yet lighthearted. Answers may initially elude readers but after becoming known they seem surprisingly self-evident.', \"Pat is a bit paranoid about people who read a puzzle and then take a furtive look at the answer without even trying to solve. That's not right! So all of his books include various intriguing schemes to prevent answers from being seen at a glance. However all answers are still readily available but not until readers deliberately seek them.\", 'In addition to his games, Pat likes to add unusual features in his books. For instance, in his brand new book, \"The Cleverest Brain Games on the Planet\", Pat includes an illustration of a character on each puzzle page. Its facial expression and body language reveal the degree of challenge that readers will likely encounter. His book \"Are You Smart, or What?, A Bizarre Book of Games & Fun for Everyone\" includes a playful scoring technique for each puzzle and a hilarious evaluation of brain power at the end of each of three sections to add to reader enjoyment. His book \"Smart Is as Smart Does, Brain Games to Reveal the Genius in You\" has much the same feature.', 'The book \"So You Think You\\'re Smart, 150 Fun and Challenging Brain Teasers\" is also unique. All answers are given in a mirror image and an unbreakable plastic mirror is provided with every book to read the answer. Apparently people like this innovation because the book is in its 19th (and final) printing.', 'The answers in his book \"If You\\'re So Smart, Prove it!, Amusing Word Games For All Ages\" presents answers in yet a different way. All answers are given upside-down on the opposite page and in a reduced size script font to obscure it from being read accidently.', 'Obviously, Pat is a fun-loving guy. When entertaining organizations with his word games he appears in costume as a stereotypical rocket scientist reminiscent of his former career. He is then known as Dr. Fun to the delight of his audiences.']}"
