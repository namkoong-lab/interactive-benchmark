One of four children, she suffered abuse at the hands of her great-aunt and uncle until she moved to Seattle to be raised by her maternal grandparents. Early on, McCarthy lets the reader in on her secret: The chapter you just read may not be wholly reliable—facts have been distilled through the hazy lens of time and distance.In",

        "Review",
        "“Time has not dulled the sharpness of the image and incident here, and the portraiture has an exceptional definition to which the polished prose—there is never a flubbed phrase—is certainly contributory. There is also a warmth, and an often gamine charm . . . which may attract others beyond her anticipated audience.” —",
        "Kirkus",
        "Reviews“One of the most stinging, brilliant and disturbing memoirs ever written by an American . . . McCarthy accomplishes the astonishing feat of revising the contents of her stories—or memoirs, if you will—without making you wish she had altered their permanent form. . . . In Miss McCarthy’s fine book the process adds new art to old on her own road through the past into the future.” —",
