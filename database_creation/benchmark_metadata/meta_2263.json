        "Aaron Malone has an almost perfect life in Atlanta, Georgia. He’s happily married to his lovely wife, Monica, and they have two beautiful three-year old twin boys named Brandon and Braylon. In addition to that, he works as a senior designer at a very respectable and reputable architect firm called Donaldson and Bradshaw. Donaldson and Bradshaw have been awarded the prestigious honor of revitalizing the old General Motors assembly plant which has been desolate for many years. To no one’s surprise, Aaron is appointed to spearhead the revitalization project and is named the chief designer. His firm hires a smart, ambitious, and sexy consultant named Tiffany Towns to assist him. She’s everything to rave for and is easily referred to as “eye candy” during her first day on the job. Even Sebastian, Aaron’s best friend and colleague, notices her and advises Aaron everything that glitters isn’t gold. Tiffany has more in mind than just working as a consultant with Aaron. The pair eventually has a hot and steamy one-night sexual escapade. Nevertheless, soon after the sexual encounter, Aaron attempts to distance himself from her to no avail. The plot thickens when an array of sheer coincidences and bad luck begin to occur with Aaron and his family. Later, this evolves into distrust, betrayal, and even death. The ultimate caveat is trying to figure out who is the real “eye candy.” Be forewarned though, that the obvious is simply not the obvious. You’re guaranteed to be surprised how the ending plays out in this highly unpredictable romantic thriller."
