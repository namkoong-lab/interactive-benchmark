        "We are creatures of time. It affects every moment of our lives. Yet when we study the Bible, our focus tends to be on principles and personalities rather than on how the events of redemptive history were perfectly timed by God. Since my own study of the Bible's timeline opened my eyes to some of God's biggest truths, my goals is to introduce as many people as possible to the rich experience of studying Scripture with a focus on God's timing.",
        "Second Peter 3:8 states, \"But, beloved, do notforget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day\" (NKJV). Whether the time frame is accurate is not the question now, but this passage suggests that a day of time is much different for God from how it is for us, His creation. It is hard for me to comprehend how a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day, but that is how it appears to God.",
        "The Almighty stands outside of time. He created time and operates within it when He chooses. God can move in and out of time as He desires. Wayne Grudem rightfully states, :It is evident throughout Scripture that God acts within time and acts differently at different points in time.\" (1)",
        "The Bible records what God has done in the past and what He plans to do in the future to bring us to salvation. If we study Scripture well, we will discover a number of important things about how God operates. From the very beginning of human history, man has needed a Savior (see Genesis 3:15). Although Jesus Christ came nearly 2,000 years ago, we are waiting for Him to return and finish what He started.",
        "The church worldwide needs to be awake when Jesus Christ returns. Believers do not want to be like the disciples who fell asleep in the garden of Gethsemane, failing to pray and keep watch with Jesus (Matthew 26:36-46). If we are spiritually asleep when Jesus returns, we will miss one of the greatest moments in the history of the world. We must keep our lamps trimmed and burning.",
        "This is why it's crucial for us to pay attention to the Bible's timeline. The purpose of this book is to give you (the reader) important keys to help you better understand God's plan and His character through studying the time frame of Scripture. God is marching methodically through His Word. The book of Revelation instructs us that God's Word has not come to an end yet, but the end of this time of grace and salvation is approaching. We must use the precious time we have to reach the lost--those who have yet to receive Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as their personal Savior. He is the Savior of the world.",
        "Through my countles hours of study into God's timing I have become a different person. I fully know and trust that God will act when He is ready according to His timetable, not mine. He has taught me to be patient and endure difficult circumstances with a sense of hope and expectancy. I hope this book will do the same for you. May God open your eyes to the wonders of His perfect timing as you read on."
