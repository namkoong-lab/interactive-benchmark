        "Founded in 1701 by Antoine de le Mothe Cadillac as a trading post and fort, Detroit had a turbulent early history. Captured by the British in 1760, ceded to the United States in 1783, and destroyed by fire in 1805, Detroit nevertheless prospered throughout the nineteenth century because of its strategic position. The twentieth century saw the rise and demise of the auto industry and despite the city’s troubled recent past, a new Detroit is rising to meet the economic challenges of the twenty-first century. This book is a fascinating document of history and change in one of the United States’ most important cities.Sites include: Woodward Avenue, Detroit Waterfront, Campus Martius, Jefferson Avenue, Cadillac Square, Capitol Park, J.L.
