        "Poet and writer Alison Deming once noted, “In the desert, one finds the way by tracing the aftermath of water . . . ”Here, Ken Lamberton finds his way through a lifetime of exploring southern Arizona’s Santa Cruz River. This river—dry, still, and silent one moment, a thundering torrent of mud the next—serves as a reflection of the desert around it: a hint of water on parched sand, a path to redemption across a thirsty landscape.With his latest book, Lamberton takes us on a trek across the land of three nations—the United States, Mexico, and the Tohono O’odham Nation—as he hikes the river’s path from its source and introduces us to people who draw identity from the river—dedicated professionals, hardworking locals, and the author’s own family. These people each have their own stories of the river and its effect on their lives, and their narratives add immeasurable richness and depth to Lamberton’s own astute observations and picturesque descriptions.Unlike books that detail only the Santa Cruz’s decline,",
        "Dry River",
        "offers a more balanced, at times even optimistic, view of the river that ignites hope for reclamation and offers a call to action rather than indulging in despair and resignation. At once a fascinating cultural history lesson and an important reminder that learning from the past can help us fix what we have damaged,",
        "Dry River",
        "is both a story about the amazing complexity of this troubled desert waterway and a celebration of one man’s lifelong journey with the people and places touched by it."

        "“Historically, culturally, ecologically, and aesthetically,",
        "Dry River",
        "records the river’s metamorphoses in order to reconstruct five hundred years of geological and social change. With scholarly expertise artfully enlivened by his five super-keen senses and much literary skill, Lamberton has produced a southwestern environmental classic.”—Harold Fromm, author of",

        "“Time is, of course, a river. So as Ken Lamberton walks the two-hundred-mile length of the Santa Cruz River near Tucson, he travels also through the long histories of the people who sank their roots in the sandy washes. Lamberton is an amiable and well-informed guide, and the territory he covers is fascinating.”—Kathleen Dean Moore, author of",
        "Wild Comfort",
        "“In this eloquent riparian love story, all things ultimately flow together: past and present and future, family and place, struggle and hope, and even earthly exploration and the search for signs of life on Mars. Taking stock of his life in the Santa Cruz watershed and stalking the passionate history and subtle natural patterns of this (often) dry river, Ken Lamberton warmly embraces his amazing family and the extraordinary desert characters, human and otherwise, of southern Arizona and northern Mexico. This is a compelling work of hope and celebration.”—Scott Slovic, editor of",

        "\"The narrative is delightful, and is told as the author walks sections of the Santa Cruz River, from its headwaters to its confluence more than 200 miles away. Often it is a wifeor daughter who drops him off or picks him up from his journey or accompanies him. The poetry of the page is matched by the humanity of the author's story.\"—",

After graduating from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in biology, I joined the creative writing workshop of poet and author Richard Shelton and soon began publishing articles and essays about the natural history of the Southwest.\", 'While mentoring with Richard Shelton, my writing began appearing in national magazines and literary journals like Arizona Highways, Bird Watcher\\'s Digest, Manoa, Northern Lights, Alligator Juniper, Puerto Del Sol, and the Gettysburg Review. Several of these essays, in turn, were selected for anthologies such as American Nature Writing, Getting Over the Color Green, and David Quammen\\'s The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2000. Editors have nominated two of my essays for Pushcart Prizes, and Robert Atwan of The Best American Essays series listed my work in \"Notable Essays of 1998\" and again in \"Notable Essays of 1999.\"', 'In January 2000, Mercury House published my first book, Wilderness and Razor Wire, to critical acclaim. The San Francisco Chronicle called it, \"...entirely original: an edgy, ferocious, subtly complex collection of essays...\". The book won the 2002 John Burroughs Medal for outstanding nature writing.', 'After I completed my MFA in creative writing at the University of Arizona, I continued writing and publishing essays and books about the Southwest. In 2015, The University of Arizona Press published my sixth book, Chasing Arizona, which deals my travels to 52 destinations in 52 weeks, experiencing the people, places, and treasures that make our state great. Today, I live with my wife in an 1890s stone cottage near Bisbee, Arizona.']}"
