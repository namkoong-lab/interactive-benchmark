        "Judge's comments:An excellent slice of history not usually written about. Well written, sympathetic characters and that extra emotional umph which held this reader from first word to the last.",
        "From the Author",
        "Ideas spring up from everywhere.This story came into being because I 'heard' Becan singing the song and had been reading about interesting Bronze and Iron age sites in Denmark. One site had a house which was not orientated the normal way and there was a bag of Roman coins in a hiding place by the hearth.",

        "p.d.r. lindsay has been writing short stories for a very long time. Her first publication was in her school magazine and for a while she paid the bills writing short stories for 'the People's Friend' until she broke into the (then) well-paying university literary journals in the USA and Canada, but she still has a soft spot for nice comforting 'Ah, isn't it nice!' stories. In between novels, or when the novel won't move until the characters have sorted themselves out, p.d.r. continues to write short stories and hopes her skills are improving.",

Home is in wild and wonderful Otago, with glorious beaches, mountain ranges and empty places.', \"In 2012 a group of us decided that the new world of publishing was for us. That's why Writer's Choice came into being. Writer's Choice is a publishing co-operative. It works like a traditional publisher in that fiction has to be submitted and accepted, edited, and published to the highest possible standards. The key factor to acceptance is quality writing and a darned good story. Being part of the group means supporting each others' books and efforts. It is a lot of work but also a lot of fun having the group's support. Writing is a lonely task and I often need a pal to talk out a plot problem.\"]}"
