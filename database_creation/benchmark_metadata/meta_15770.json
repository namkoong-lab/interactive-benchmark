    "description": [
        "An oceanic symbol of peace the wave was often portrayed by Japanese artist Hokusai. The movement of ocean waves also represents the Buddhist journey from illusion to enlightenment. An artistic homage by Jason Main. From War to Peace turns weapons meant to destroy us into art meant to restore us, swords into plowshares, bombs into beauty, hate into love, & war into peace. We recycle copper from disarmed nuclear weapon systems to create a remarkable alloy called Peace BronzeTM, from which we cast stunning jewelry and art for those who share our commitment to a world without war."
