        "The Thar is designed for those riders need to move the saddle further forward than a traditional saddle will allow. The Thar gives the rider 3.5cm of additional forward adjustment due to the increased rail length and the forward sit position. Add it all up and the Thar is perfect for big wheeled mountain bikes with slack seat tube angles. Features K:ium rails and a thermoplastic shell."
