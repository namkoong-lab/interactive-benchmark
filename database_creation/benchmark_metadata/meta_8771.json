        "A memoir about 3 interconnected relationships & 3 special men in my life. The fact that you’re reading this makes me happy. Maybe you’ve mistaken this for a “how to give a good happy ending” sexual self-help book. Maybe you’re reading because you have a genuine interest in another’s journey. Either way, I’m good. My journey almost destroyed me. Almost. Boy, have I come to like that word. What a pleasurable word almost can be. You may almost be ready to buy my book. You may almost be ready to begin an amazing new journey of your own. You may almost be over that rainbow Judy Garland sings about. What great potential almost can hold, if you can flip your way of thinking. Just imagine… controlled pessimism, doubt, and fear flipped into blind optimism, faith, and love."

        "Tia has managed to capture in words her journey with three interconnected relationships as she pays homage to three special men in her life. She has that uncanny capability to seize your attention and make you feel as though you're her closest friend & that rare ability true artists share - she pulls on your heartstrings until you feel her thoughts. Tia writes with honest love; even in her pain there is love. Her actions in alignment with her intention - to do no harm & ultimately express only love. She's captured in words what most of us have trouble just attempting to think about - wanting to be the best person we can be. By sharing her innermost being with the world you too may learn to fly like a beautiful butterfly as Tia so naturally does just by being honest and learning to live as herself. Reviewed by;Dr. Maryel McKinley PhD CADCII renown Book Reviewer, Former Host KABC's Radio show \"Back-Talk\" & host of Optimistic Media --Dr. Maryel McKinleyTia Shurina had three special men in her life: very different individuals who each provided her with something unusual, and who contributed to her evolution during one year that combined elements of heaven and hell after Shurina struggled with a possible cancer diagnosis and its impact on her life, relationships, and perspective. It's also about American culture, the risks and challenges of the healthcare system, family relationships and the spirituality of children, pregnancy and work, shifting energies and values, quests for interpersonal connections, and reaching out to life publically and privately. The unifying factors to Shurina's memoir are that it's wide-ranging and logical, relationship-driven, and indicative of the backwards and forwards flows of life itself. Readers who harbor a prior affection for autobiography fueled by interpersonal interactions, romance, and angst alike will appreciate this multi-faceted account of one woman's wild ride through a changing life. Such an audience will find Everything and a Happy Ending a rollicking ride indeed, filled with the ups, downs, and changes indicative of a life well lived. --D.
