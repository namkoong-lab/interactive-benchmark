        "On March 12 2012, Kenny White and I flew to Anchorage, AK to begin a 32 night road trip. After a wonderful week in Alaska, we flew to Seattle, spent a lovely few days driving to Southern California and then began working our way back north. The last night of the trip was at the 'The Triple Door', in Seattle April 1st. This is a recording of that show."
