        "Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher (Chevy Chase), a reporter for the L.A. Times, is contacted by the executor of his late-aunt's will, attorney Amanda Ray Ross (Patricia Kalember). Ross informs Fletch he has inherited his late-aunt's mansion and 80 acre plantation property, Belle Isle, in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Upon arriving in Louisiana, Fletch is disappointed to find the mansion completely dilapidated, but nonetheless agrees to keep on its caretaker, Calculus Entrophy (Cleavon Little). Fletch has dinner with Ross at her home that evening and she tells him of a $225,000 bid for Belle Isle made by an anonymous buyer. After sleeping with Ross, Fletch awakens the next morning to find her dead."
