        "Wouldn't it be nice to have a handy collection of highlights from the Dalai Lama's writings and teachings? Renuka Singh, a student and friend of the Dalai Lama, brings together a sampling of his words for each day of the year in",
        "The Path to Tranquility",
        ". In her selections you can sense the intimate encouragement of the student-teacher relationship. The Dalai Lama's words are not distant platitudes or profound proclamations but rather small insights and patient exhortations to keep trying. \"We can deny everything except that we have the possibility of being better.\" \"As a spiritual trainee, you must be prepared to endure the hardships of being involved in a genuine spiritual pursuit.\" \"Nothing is more important than guarding the mind.\" These thoughts are germane to practical cultivation, and pondering a daily passage is a great way to keep the mind coming back to its center. Take a page from the Dalai Lama, and set yourself on the path to tranquility.",

        "From Kirkus Reviews",
        "A mezzo-mezzo book from the Dalai Lama (Ethics for the New Millennium, p. 1044). This collection of excerpts from the the Tibetan leader's writings and speeches is organized like Meditations for Women Who Do Too Muchthe reader is encouraged to meditate on a different snippet each day. The excerpts range from a description of a Calcutta hospital to a cautionary note about marriage, from a pronouncement that the media should worry more about the common good than ratings to musings on generosity. The Dalai Lama combats the deconstructionists, asserting that whenever one reads a book, one must consider the context in which the author wrote it. He trots out the clich that ``there is nothing like teaching to help one learn'' and suggests that, in order to change the world, one should start with changing one's own behavior. One wishes for a more heavy-handed editor. The readings seem thrown together randomly, and too many of the selections are utterly banal. Do we really need to spend May 12 reflecting on the fact that when the Dalai Lama loses his temper with someone, he later apologizes? Dip into this book, but don't make it your daily companion for a year. --",
