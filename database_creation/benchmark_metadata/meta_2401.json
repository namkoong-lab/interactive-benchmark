        "Someone murders Cassie's best friend in the alley behind the sex toy shop she manages.To make her day even better, the pre-cog working the case declares that Cassie saw the event. Which would put her in two places at the same time. Impossible. Cassie has no special abilities. Not unless you consider sarcasm a superpower.\"Poisoned Pearls\"—the first novel in a fast-paced urban fantasy series—follows our irreverent heroine on her journey through an alternate (though just as wintery cold) Minneapolis.Be sure to read the rest of the novels in this series as well, \"Tainted Water\", \"Spoiled Harvest\", and \"Bloodied Ice.\""
