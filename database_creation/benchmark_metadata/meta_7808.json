        "It's 1943 and the Japanese juggernaut has swallowed Shanghai and the rest of eastern China, snaring droves of American and British and German Jewish refugees. Newlyweds Dr. Franz Adler and his wife, Sunny, adjust to life running the city's only hospital for refugee Jews. Bowing to Nazi pressure, the Japanese force twenty thousand Jewish refugees, including the Adlers, to relocate to a one-square-kilometer \"Shanghai Ghetto.\" Heat, hunger, and tropical diseases are constant threats. But music, theater, sports, and Jewish culture thrive despite what are at times subhuman conditions. Navigating Nazi treachery and ever-worsening conditions while living under the heel of the Japanese military, the Adlers struggle to keep the hospital open and their family safe and united."

Featuring two multi-generational families, a major West Coast medical center and interwoven storylines, he tackles the human condition through the loves, lives and struggles of characters connected by lineage and bound by family secrets.\", 'His books have been translated into ten languages, and Pandemic and Resistance have been optioned for feature films.', 'Daniel received his MD from the University of British Columbia. He is married and the proud father of two girls in a home predominated by the XX chromosome (even his beloved Labrador retriever, Lola, is female.)']}"
