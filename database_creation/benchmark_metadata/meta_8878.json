        "Glory Bishop lives her life in pieces. At work and with her friends, she reads novels, speaks her mind, and enjoys slow dances and stolen kisses with her boyfriend, JT. But at home, Glory follows strict rules and second-guesses every step. Though she dreams of going to college and living like a normal teenage girl, her abusive mother has other ideas. When JT leaves to join the navy, Glory is left alone and heartsick. The preacher's son, Malcolm Porter, begins to shower her with lavish gifts, and her mother pushes Glory to accept his advances. Glory is torn between waiting for true love with JT or giving in to the overzealous Malcolm. When a stranger attacks Glory on the street, Malcolm steps in to rescue her, and her interest in him deepens. But the closer she gets to him, the more controlling he becomes. Glory must eventually decide whether to rely on others or to be her own savior."

        "\"Deborah King has written a compelling, thought-provoking novel that engages readers and made me wish the story would never end.\"",
        "-Chicago Writer's Association Windy City Reviews",
        "\"If you enjoy complex characters, you'll love this book. From a zealous and abusive mother to a free-spirited best friend much older than Glory, the cast is as engrossing as Glory herself. Deborah King maintains complete control of the narrative, manipulating perception of the characters even as their actions go in other directions. In some ways, you may even find yourself sympathizing with the violent boyfriend.  Deborah King wields the pen in such a way as to grab you by the wrist and pull you along like you're best friends. Glory Bishop is Chicago's answer to Judy Blume!\" ---",
        "JORDAN EHMANN  - Indies today",
        "\"Glory Bishop is an enthralling novel, sad, yet hopeful, written beautifully and masterfully in a way only a true storyteller can accomplish. The characters are complex, and unravelling their motivations, desires, strengths, and weaknesses, will keep readers thinking about this novel long after the last page.\" ----",
        "USA Today bestselling author Kelly Stone Gamble",
        "Glory Bishop is timely and timeless. This book should be required reading for every woman who thinks she must be obedient to be loved. Glory is a protagonist who has a lot going against her, but Ms. King makes her strong, and it is a delight to see where that strength takes her.---",
        "Barbara Conrey USA Today Bestselling Author of Nowhere Near Goodbye",

        "She was standing at a softly rumbling dryer, folding \"mountain fresh\" scented towels, when she heard the door opening behind her.\"Hello, Miss Glory.\"She continued folding, pretending not to hear.\"I said, hello, Miss Glory.\"She would not give that devil's son the satisfaction of responding.The door closed, and she hoped he'd gone, but then he was behind her... his arms around her waist... his lips touching her shoulder. \"Remember the first time you let me kiss you? You said you'd be my wife.\"Glory shrugged off the kiss and tried to ignore him--tried not to notice his scent or relax in his arms. She tried not to respond to his voice... tried not to care.His lips touched the back of her neck. \"Remember the second time you let me kiss you? You said you'd be my girl.\"Glory deliberately brushed his kiss from her neck and moved to the washing machine, careful to keep her back to him.\"Oh... so it's like that now, huh? No problem. I'll just sit down and watch you work. I've got all night. And you know, I always did appreciate you from behind, too.\"Glory growled under her breath, taking her annoyance out on the wet towels she pulled from the washer. She heard him sigh loudly as he settled down on the old couch. She whispered a prayer for patience and strength.\"Know what?\" he asked. \"I feel like singing.\"Glory continued her work and tried to ignore him as he flubbed his way through \"Ribbon in the Sky\" and \"Isn't She Lovely,\" but when he started singing \"Brick House,\" she threw down the towel she was folding and gripped the edge of the table.\"Josiah Jackson, you leave me alone. Right now!\"\"Oh... so you're talking to me now, huh? I win big. I get to hear your pretty voice and look at your fine a--\"\"No!\" Glory turned to face him, arms folded, seething, channeling every bit of hurt and anger into a glare that she wished would burn him to cinders. \"No. I'm not talking to you. I'm asking the devil to leave me alone! I'm asking Satan himself to leave me alone and never speak to me again.\"\"Well,\" he said, standing and moving toward her. \"Your prayer is gonna be answered. I'm leaving for the navy tomorrow.\"He smiled. He actually smiled. That no-good lying two-timing devil smiled his smug smile--that",
