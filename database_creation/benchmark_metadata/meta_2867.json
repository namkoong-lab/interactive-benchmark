        "The first follow-up novella to Ren & Galen's story in Jigsaw Hearts:It's amazing how basking in love, trust, and promises can transform a person. I, Ren Hayden, am genuinely happy. Growing ever more secure with our relationship, Galen and I have grand and determined plans for our future together and for helping his sister create the art gallery of her dreams. We are moving past the extreme, harrowing circumstances of finding each other and settling into a new normal.After a difficult business trip in Vienna involving obnoxious rock star, Tristan Turn, I arrive home to sweet, out-of-the-box gestures from Galen and steamy rendezvous that only confirm the depth of our love. (It's amazing what you can get away with in a museum.)But suddenly ... Galen grows distant, behaves strangely, and admits he is keeping something from me. Does his family know what's going on? Is it the beginning of the end for us? How could a girl like me know? Even my empathic strengths hold few clues. One thing is certain: If the sort of love Galen and I have cannot last, how could true love exist at all?What comes next? Galen takes up most of the narrative in a second follow-up novella: Whole Piece of My Heart"

        "About the Author",
        "Danica Raimz writes romance that showcases sex as the icing on a cake full of emotional depth. If she could, she would live in upstate New York with a cat named Magic, a Golden named Daystar, the time to leisurely chomp through far more books on her TBR list, and the finances to travel whenever and wherever she wants. In the meantime, she'll just keep wrestling with the keyboard and fate to get there.",

In fact, she would welcome any explanation for her new life, new locale, and new way of seeing the world. If someone had told her she would be writing steamy romance ... well, that would have flat-out shocked her. Still, if unwillingly uprooting your life and waiting for the dust to settle has any perks, the drive to rebel and regain control of your life on your own terms is one of them. Danica now loves to write the sort of romance where sex is the sweet, enticing, satisfying icing on the cake of relationships that are meant to be. A solid story, unique characters, true love, emotional rollercoasters, and steamy encounters are the hallmark of her work.', '------------------------------------------------------', 'The AWAKEN MY HEART series:', 'Ever wish you could have more time with characters you grew to love in a novel?
