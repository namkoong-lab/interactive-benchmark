        "Wilbert Longtail, an orangey-red tabby with an extremely long tail, can’t understand what all the Christmas fuss is about. His humans have even brought a tree inside. So as all cats do, he takes a catnap to think things through.Wilbert awakens to find himself in ancient Bethlehem. In search of a way home, he encounters the animals and people of the Nativity, and witnesses the birth of Jesus. But where there is great good, evil will rise to oppose it. An enormous rat emerges from the shadows, intent on harming the sleeping baby. It falls to Wilbert to confront the threat—an encounter that ultimately leads him to the truth of Christmas."
