A nomadic spirit, she’s lived all over the U.S. and currently resides in Philadelphia, where she attends St. Joseph’s University. She grew up in the South and feels right at home on a porch with a glass of sweet tea and a plate of fried green tomatoes, though her heart belongs to the moody Pacific Northwest, where she once lived and loved in a cozy cottage in the woods. When she’s not writing, she’s watching classic movies, planning road trips, or cuddling up with her animals and a book. She loves Jesus, the ocean, British humor, and retro everything.
