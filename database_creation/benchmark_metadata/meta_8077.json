        "Whether you are visitor, vacationer, or resident, this tour book will be your indispensable guide to the history and charm of Cape May Point, New Jersey, as you stroll past its wonderful collection of nineteenth-century cottages. Three walking tours encompass more than 70 of Cape May Point’s earliest buildings – each illustrated in full color with engaging descriptions of their architectural features. Each tour is a delightful way to spend a leisurely hour or so. Additionally, two-dozen rare photographs portray handsome houses that did not survive the ravages of development and storms that devastated one-fifth of the original community. Ten “top pick” contemporary homes are also featured and described. If you cannot tell a baluster from a bargeboard, have no fear. The fully illustrated glossary interprets any professional jargon so that you will soon become knowledgeable about domestic Victorian architecture. Cape May Point attracts many for its delightful cottages, intimate scale, gracious town plan, and preserved natural beauty. How did this combination happen? And what are the distinctive architectural results? This book will tell you and present the magic of Cape May Point. Read and explore."
