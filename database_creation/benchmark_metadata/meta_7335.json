        "The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that 9 out of 10 women will be solely responsible for their finances at some point in their lives, yet many are seriously intimidated by money matters.

        "In this stock-market primer, former portfolio manager Bertrand gives helpful advice for the uninitiated. She covers the jargon of investing and relates investment decisions to life-cycle events. While she gives a fair overview of investment clubs and provides a brief summary of investment theories and strategies, along with her opinion of each, the tax considerations of investing are given short shrift. This may be just as well because the little that is said here about tax consequences has become outdated because of recent tax legislation. Bertrand does not cover estate planning, but women are advised to take care that their children learn the importance of investing. This is a fine overview of investing considerations; readers looking for depth, however, will be disappointed.?Joseph Barth, U.S. Military Acad.
