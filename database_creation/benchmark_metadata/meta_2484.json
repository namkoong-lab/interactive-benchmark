        "Here is my Lisa's Reads Non-warning: This book is a beautifully written story for a wide age range audience. There is no sexual activity, no drug use, very little alcohol consumption and very minimal use of profanity. While none of those things are included in the story...none of them are missed! Moms...this is one of those books you and your tween/teen daughter can read together.",
