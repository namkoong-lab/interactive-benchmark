        "Fashion depends on visuals. When we see something we like, we respond to its color, line, form, and eye-appeal. Communicating about fashion demands much more, though. It involves a wide range of media including words-printed, spoken, and electronically transmitted. \"Fashion communications\" refers not only to monthly fashion magazines, but also to every facet of information relating to fashion-from names of colors at the dye factory to the latest runway reviews on fashion Web sites.",

Wolbers, Ph.D., of the Tennis Hall of Fame, and Mary Jane Wolbers, a Heritage Award Winner of the National Dance Association. Marian Wolbers writes novels, short stories, drama, poetry, and nonfiction, and she teaches writing and Japanese culture through literature at Albright College in Pennsylvania. Her first novel, Rider, set in the subways and on the trains of Tokyo, was released by St. Martin\\'s Press in November 1996 under the Wyatt imprint, receiving favorable reviews by Publisher\\'s Weekly, Booklist, The San Francisco Chronicle, and Library Journal (\"recommended for all public and academic libraries\").', 'Wolbers\\' short story \"The Rescue\" was published in The Southampton Review (Spring 2014); \"The Woodpile\" appeared in Westview (Fall 2014); and \"Carolyn\\'s Supper\" debuted June 2015 in Remarkable Doorways (online literary journal). Wolbers\\' most recent novel, Pennsylvania Powwow: Rising Sun above the Devil\\'s Door, tells the story of Leora, her broken heart, and a life-and-death sibling struggle over family land and legacy. Set in the 1980s, the story\\'s action moves from the Pennsylvania Dutch hills with their secretive powwowing practices to the New Hampshire forests where an unsettling mystery suddenly seals Leora\\'s and her family\\'s fate.', 'Two of Wolbers’ dramatic plays, American Beauties and Holding the World, have been produced, in Lewisburg and Allentown, PA, respectively, while a third play, Return of the Sun Goddess, was featured in a staged reading at the First Annual North Carolina Playwrights Festival.
