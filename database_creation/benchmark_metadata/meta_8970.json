        "Review",
        "“These studies are gems, often looking at well-known figures in a fresh light. Now we have all twenty-seven of these studies brought together in one fat volume. If you want to be stirred and challenged by the Christ who stirred and challenged these twenty-seven servants of sovereign joy, look no further.”―",

        "Cofounder and Theologian-at-Large, The Gospel Coalition",
        "“",
        "27 Servants of Sovereign Joy",
        "is a landmark book. A cursory look at the table of contents might lead one to expect a retreading of familiar material, but the book is a triumph of originality―so much so that I do not hesitate to call it a page-turner. Piper does a wonderful job of taking us into unexpected corners of his subjects’ lives and writings. The book is a monument of research and scholarship. Of course, the final effect is spiritual edification, which the book conveys in abundance. The scope of the book and quantity of detail is breathtaking.”―",

        "Emeritus Professor of English, Wheaton College",
        "“Good biographies are almost like another kind of Bible commentary, illustrating and confirming the faithfulness of God in the lives of his people. This collection brings together portraits from a variety of times and contexts that can hugely enrich us in our own. Highly recommended.”―",

        "What God Has to Say about Our Bodies",
        "“John Piper is a vivacious storyteller with a profound ability to weave together a meticulously intimate portrait of God’s sovereign joy set ablaze in the human story. These twenty-seven biographies are a passionately compelling reminder that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses that bid us to persistently endure the race set before us. What a gift to have this compilation now in one volume―highly accessible, warmly pastoral, and decidedly focused on the grace of Christ shining through the lives of sinners, chosen by God, and used for his glory.”―",

        "is a cornucopia of moving and motivating biographies of leaders whose lives have left a lasting impact. John Piper’s assembly of heroes reveals a company of struggling saints who nevertheless faithfully persevered through weakness, doubt, and adversity. These tales told by a master storyteller will inspire and encourage both leaders and readers to deeper commitment for Christ.”―",
