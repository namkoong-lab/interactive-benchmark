        "It has only been a couple of weeks since the events of Exit Zero, yet in the Garden State, life goes on as usual—except it’s with zombies. The state is still sealed off from the rest of the nation, but those trapped inside have learned to adapt and overcome. President Callahan and the Post Conflict Restoration Corp are firmly in charge at the new Cape May, New Jersey based White House. A new mutation has emerged targeting those that have survived infection of the Skell virus without reducing them to the whole flesh eating, brain melting, stomach transforming into a brain thing. The Virus Infected Non-Necrotic Individuals(VINNI’s) appear as if they are just a more physically fit version of you or me, but they are now biologically different and for unknown reasons are highly sought after by Post Conflict Restoration Corp .The remainder of the Sullivan brothers are trying to find their own way in this new world. The prepper Ivan and his assassin wife Marifi are on the run and Gary Ragu is taking action to head the Jersey mafia. Dr. Woody has found new allies in his efforts to right the wrongs caused by his Modified Embryonic Animal Tissue (M.E.A.T), but can he trust them? Welcome to Nuke Jersey, the future of America and possibly the world."

        "Review",
        "\"The author's sense of humor comes in the books. Many times I read a sentence and wondered how his mind came up with some of the ideas. I laughed often too. The nicknames!!! I find it very easy to suspend disbelief, even as a scientist. There is a little bit of everything in this book, political intrigue, calamity, eco-terrorism, WMDs, science, social issues, NJ mob families, military . . . and zombies, er . . . \"the infected.\" It's almost like I can take every major movie/TV series growing up and put them all together, add zombies and creative writing skills and you get this series, making the series feel familiar and comforting, while still very fresh/new (which sounds impossible, but Neil Cohen did it).\" -- Dr. Terry Oroszi, Assistant Professor, Molecular Geneticist, Terrorist Researcher, CBRN Defense Director, and Strategic Planner\"Neil Cohen's book is a must read. As a survivor of ten military deployments and hurrican Katrina, I must say that I couldn't put this book down. Those who love the end of the world type genre will love this book.\" -- Larry C. James, Colonel (retired) U.S. Army and Professor, School of Professional Psychology, Wright State University\"An interesting method of kicking off the zombie apocalypse that leads to an interesting twist in zombie anatomy.\" -- DreadCentral.com\"Details long missing from zombie lore are sure to please the zombie fan who wants answers.\" -- Zom-B.com\"One of the best books I've read in a while in regards to the zombie apocalypse. This is a total different take from your usual zombie biting and infecting people.\" -- Anna Olvera, CREATORS.CO\"I can finally admit that",
        "Exit Zero",
        "has frightened me to the very core. Until now I've been a massive zombie fan and enjoyed the movies, books and TV shows for that they are; fiction. This book is disturbing because it demonstrates the ease of how a massive pandemic could be engineered and controlled by any number of large corporations, terriorist cells, or even our own government.\" -- ZWeapons.com\"Neil Cohen is a tireless advocate, working to keep the zombie genre 'undead'.\" -- Robin Justice, WalkerStalkerCon\"There are countless examples of just how fluidly Cohen gives context to his outbreak, maintaining the same fantasy Zombie survivial scenarios we all love, but grounding it with some cynical home truths. There is no doubt that Cohen's fantasy world bears, all too worringly, halmarks of our modern society, and as organic as the parallels seem to be, I have never seen them used as astutely as they are in this franchise.\" -- Graeme Martin, Beyond the Gore",

Cohen is an author who wanted nothing more than to contribute to the Zombie/ Post Apocalyptic /Dystopia literary genre' of which he has been a fan for many years. His full time job allows him interaction with many types of federal government agencies and most of the services within the Armed Services. He has consulted with officers from both foreign and domestic military's on how a true zombie pandemic would be responded to and managed. He tried to make the story based within the realm of the possible and consulted with representatives from World Health Organization, NATO, United Nations, FEMA and Emergency Management agencies nationwide to help craft the virus and its inception. While unlikely, nothing in this story is impossible. The sequel to Exit Zero, titled Nuke Jersey, released in June 2017 and the third in the trilogy, Zombie Democracy, released June 2018. His first non-fiction title, Business is Dead, Resurrecting Entrepreneurship released in 2019 and features stories of true fans who turned their fandom into entrepreneurships.
