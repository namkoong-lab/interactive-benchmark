        "Frank Lloyd Wright (18671959) is widely considered to be the greatest American architect of all time; indeed, his work virtually ushered in the modern era and remains highly influential today. His wide-ranging and paradigm-shifting oeuvre is the subject of TASCHENs three-volume monograph that covers all of his designs (numbering approximately 1,100), both realized and unrealized.",
        "Made in cooperation with the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives in Taliesin, Arizona, this collection leaves no stone unturned in examining and paying tribute to Wrights life and work. From his early Prairie Houses (typified by the Robie House) to the Usonian concept home and progressive living architecture buildings to late projects like the spiral Guggenheim Museum in New York and the development of his fantastic vision of a better tomorrow via his concept of the living city, all of the phases of Wrights career are painstakingly described and illustrated herein.Volume 1 covers the period 18851916, spanning the early Chicago years and the Prairie Houses. Its the period which provoked a profound influence on European architects and which already demonstrated Wrights knowledge of and respect for natural materials.Featured projects include the administration building for the Larkin Soap Company (19031905), and the Unity Temple (1905)."

        "“Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer is our era’s pre-eminent Wright specialist, having begun his career as Wright’s apprentice. Now archives director at Taliesin West, he has access to hundreds of thousands of documents, allowing this monograph to be a masterful summation of FLW’s long career. There is more than enough here to make this the ultimate compact work on a definitive character in architectural history.” ―",

        "About the Author",
        "Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer (1930–2017) became Frank Lloyd Wright’s apprentice at the Taliesin Fellowship, until he attended the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1958, he returned to continue his apprenticeship with Wright until his death in 1959. Pfeiffer established the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives, where he catalogued the collections of Wright’s drawings, manuscripts, letters, and other documents. He was also the author of numerous publications on Wright’s life and work.",
        "Peter Gössel runs an agency for museum and exhibition design. He has published TASCHEN monographs on Julius Shulman, R. M. Schindler, John Lautner, and Richard Neutra, as well as several titles in the Basic Architecture series."
