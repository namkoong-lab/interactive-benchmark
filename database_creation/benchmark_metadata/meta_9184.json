        "Everyone in Happyhop House experiences lots of feelings during their day. Can you spot who is happy to be playing paper aeroplanes? Who is sad that the last slice of cake has gone? Who is scared of the dark? At age 2, children enter a crucial stage in their development by starting to form friendships. In this fun, interactive question-and-answer book, young readers can look carefully at the pictures to work out who's feeling what, learning how to understand 12 key emotions and recognise them in others."

        "JARVIS lives in a very leafy and quiet part of Northern England with his girlfriend (who tells him what's good/bad and pretty much gives him most of his ideas) and their cat, who rips those ideas into tiny pieces. He has always doodled wherever his career has taken him, from graphic design student to record sleeve designer to animation director. The way that he works always begins in a sketchbook with pencil. From there it evolves into charcoal, photoshop brushes, pencil crayon or paint to finish the look. He uses many programmes, but the main ones are Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Who Is Happy? is one of his first picture books."
