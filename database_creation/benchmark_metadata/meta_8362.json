        "The Whole Beast: Nose to Tail Eating",
        "is a certified \"foodie\" classic. In it, Fergus Henderson -- whose London restaurant, St. John, is a world-renowned destination for people who love to eat \"on the wild side\" -- presents the recipes that have marked him out as one of the most innovative, yet traditional, chefs. Here are recipes that hark back to a strong rural tradition of delicious thrift, and that literally represent Henderson's motto, \"Nose to Tail Eating\" -- be they Pig's Trotter Stuffed with Potato, Rabbit Wrapped in Fennel and Bacon, or his signature dish of Roast Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad. For those of a less carnivorous bent, there are also splendid dishes such as Deviled Crab; Smoked Haddock, Mustard, and Saffron; Green Beans, Shallots, Garlic, and Anchovies; and to keep the sweetest tooth happy, there are gloriously satisfying puddings, notably the St. John Eccles Cakes, and a very nearly perfect Chocolate Ice Cream."

        "From Publishers Weekly",
        "An audacious chef whose St. John restaurant in London draws legions of fans, Henderson is a staunch proponent of using virtually the entirety of any plant or animal being served up. Harking back to the days when very little went to waste, he practices what he preaches with such victuals as Rolled Pig's Spleen, Duck's Neck Terrine and Roast Woodcock, which is cooked with innards and head intact, the latter providing a bit of \"delicious brains.\" Henderson recommends the use of a disposable Bic razor for depilating the primary ingredient in Crispy Pig Tails. And then there's Warm Pig's Head, which extreme chef Anthony Bourdain describes in his introduction as \"so Goddamn amazing that it borders on religious epiphany.\" Here, too, are four recipes for lamb's brains, a commodity that Henderson admits is illegal in both the U.S. and England. Home chefs will encounter difficulties in obtaining other ingredients as well. Blood Cake and Fried Eggs calls for a quart of fresh pig's blood, and Soft Roes on Toast requires delicate white sacs of herring semen. Sprinkled among these challenging dishes, however, are more accessible fare: Kid and Fennel, Mussels Grilled on a Barbecue, and Radishes to Accompany Duck or Goose, wherein both the radish and its leaves are added to the bird's jus. Desserts include Treacle Tart and Carragheen Pudding made with red seaweed. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "Roast Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad",
        "To Serve Four",
        "This is the one dish that does not change on the menu at St. John. The marrowbone comes from a calf's leg; ask your butcher to keep some for you. You will need tea-spoonsor long thin implements to scrape your marrow out of the bone at the table.",
        "Do you recall eating Raisin Bran for breakfast? The raisin to bran-flake ratio was always a huge anxiety, to a point, sometimes, that one was tempted to add extra raisins, which inevitably resulted in too many raisins, and one lost that pleasure of discovering the occasional sweet chewiness in contrast to the branny crunch. When administering such things as capers, it is very good to remember Raisin Bran.",
        "twelve 3-inch pieces of 1 middle veal marrowbonea healthy bunch of flatleaf parsley leaves picked fromits stems2 shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced1 modest handful of capers (extra-fine if possible)",
        "DRESSING",
        "juice of 1 lemonextra-virgin olive oila pinch of sea salt and black peppera good supply of toastcoarse sea salt",
        "Put the marrowbone pieces in an ovenproof frying panand place in a hot 450°F. oven. The roasting processshould take about 20 minutes, depending on thethickness of the bone. You are looking for the marrowto be loose and giving, but not melted away, which itwill do if left too long (traditionally the ends would becovered to prevent any seepage, but I like the coloringand crispness at the ends).",
        "Meanwhile lightly chop your parsley, just enough todiscipline it, mix it with the shallots and capers, and atthe last moment, dress the salad.",
        "Here is a dish that should not be completely seasonedbefore leaving the kitchen, rendering a last-minuteseasoning unnecessary by the actual eater; this,especially in the case of coarse sea salt, gives texture and uplift at the moment of eating. My approach is to scrape the marrow from the bone onto the toast and seasonwith coarse sea salt. Then a pinch of parsley salad ontop of this and eat. Of course once you have your pile ofbones, salad, toast, and salt it is \"liberty hall.\"",
        "Pot Roast Brisket",
        "Both this and the following brisket recipe provide very good leftovers for your hash, or are excellent in sandwiches, or simply cold, thinly sliced, with GreenSauce or Horseradish Sauce. You can salt the brisket yourself for 5 days in a brine or if you don?t want to make it yourself, you can buy salted brisket from the butcher.",

        "In a deep roasting pan, just a bit bigger than your beef, lay your chopped vegetables, garlic, herbs, andpeppercorns onto which nestle your brisket. Pour thestock and wine over it. You are looking for an icebergeffect: part of the beef is not covered but we knowthere is a lot more submerged in the stock. Cover withaluminum foil. Put into a medium oven for 3 hours,until thoroughly giving but not collapsing (keep an eyeon it; do not let it cook too fast, and turn the ovendown if this is the case).",
        "Then slice and eat it, ladling a little of the juice over the meat (keep the remaining juice, which makes avery good base for soup). Serve with HorseradishSauce.",
