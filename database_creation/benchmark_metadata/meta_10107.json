        "Planting Instructions: Select a planting location with full sun. Dahlias prefer the morning sun and thrive with 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Plant after the danger of spring frost has passed. They prefer warmer soil that is rich and well-drained. Dig a hole 6-8 inches deep and plant them 9-12 inches apart. Dahlias grow tall so, select a location protected from the wind. Insert stakes when you plant the tubers, it makes it easier to have them there from the start."
