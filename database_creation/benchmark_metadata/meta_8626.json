        "K-Gr. 2. Set five million years ago, somewhere in Africa, this picture book follows a fuzzy little fellow named Gak, who lives in a place called Big Trees and belongs to a group of creatures called hominidees. Everyone laughs at Gak because he likes to walk on two feet instead of four, as they do. However, Gak's dexterity becomes an advantage when he rescues a limping friend from a lion. Afterwards, instead of taunting him, the troop of hominidees congratulates him on his bravery and declares \"Gakky Two-Feet Day.\" The snout-nosed, big-eyed, hairy hominidees resemble monkeys. The vibrant, earth-toned watercolor-and-ink illustrations add just the right comic edge. Kids will focus on the story in this playful spoof and likely miss the subtleties (a parody of \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\" appears in one scene, for example), though the book may prompt questions about evolution or offer parents the opportunity to discuss it. The author, the former drummer for the band The Monkees, explains his interest in \"anthromythology\" in a note.",
