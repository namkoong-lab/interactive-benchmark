        "The lives of Albuquerque homicide detective Joe Denali and accused murderer Penny Murphy come together in A PENNY FOUND, a novel that includes bank fraud, a Mexican mafia connection and one woman’s desire to break free of a life of abuse.When Joe’s fellow detective undergoes critical heart surgery, he comes face-to-face with his own mortality and failures. His assignment to find the killer of a man tied to a bed in his own basement is hampered by his friend’s illness and his own personal problems. Sold by her father at age fifteen, Penny Murphy spends ten years imprisoned by fifty-year old banker Gabe Russo. Never completely broken by her imprisonment, when the opportunity arises, Penny leaves a drunken and injured Russo tied to a bed in his own basement and escapes with his car, his money and his gun. Mercy Smith and Billy Clause come into Penny’s life and appear to be her answer to freedom. She goes to work in Clause’s bar, but when Clause learns of Russo’s death, he takes Penny’s car from her. Once again she is trapped in a different type of prison."

        "I honestly could not put this book down. I was pulled in from page one and couldn't turn the pages fast enough (well, I read it on a Kindle so I guess I should say I couldn't \"click\" the page turner fast enough?)While the main premise of the story could easily have been ripped right off the front page of our newspapers, the story took many unexpected turns making it even more compelling. While the subject matter at times could be a bit gritty, it was handled with skill and compassion by the author. Like Penney, it was hard to know which of these characters we could trust and which were only out to use her. I love when an author keeps me guessing!Great job, Ms. Leachman! I'm already anxious to read the next book in the Joe Denali series!",
