This photograph of this little flying critter was taken at Salt River Pass, Wyoming and leaves the accent inlay strip showing. Each bookmark is placed in a sealed clear protective sleeve with an artist information card that explains a little about our high quality and unique designs that are all made in the USA. The back side of the wood bookmark remains blank to show the un-stained naturally beautiful raw wood grain. The dominant center eastern hard rock maple wood grain adds nicely to this butterfly photo. As a finishing touch we add a color coordinated gold colored rope tassel. This is a classy and distinguishing bookmark suited for many occasions where a gift is required.
