        "For nearly two decades, the conventional wisdom regarding the fundamentalist movement and their eventual takeover of the Southern Baptist Convention was this: At its core, it's a preacher fight. The debate and conflict was mostly isolated to denominational agencies and among ministry professionals. However, in the June of 2000, the conflict evolved in such a way that it no longer could be contained by the phrase \"preacher fight.\" In that summer, SBC leaders proposed and were granted the adoption of a revision to the 1963 \"Baptist Faith and Message.\"",
        "In a more recent stunning move of theological arrogance, SBC leadership and the International Mission Board leadership in particular have reversed their previously held position and asked IMB missionaries to sign a statement affirming the 2000 \"Baptist Faith and Message\" revision. A denomination established as a haven of Christian freedom and dedicated to the purpose of Christ-centered missions now finds itself requiring its missionaries to sign a creed that removes the person of Jesus Christ as the ultimate window through which to understand the Bible and God.",
        "\"Stand With Christ\" explores and explains the history of, the problems with, and the biblical judgment of the recent \"Baptist Faith and Message\" revision and its uses as a force of control, internal purification, and conformity. Is this a balanced book? By no means. It tips the scales with a proud allegiance to \"the freedom for which Christ set us free\" (Gal 5:1) and a disdain for all creeds save the Bible alone.",
        "This book dares to say on which side of the line we must stand.",

        "From the Publisher",
        "\"Regent's Study Guides\" is a series published jointly by Regent's Park College, Oxford, and Smyth & Helwys Publishing, Inc. It is characterized by the concern of the College to integrate careful theological thinking with the practice of pastoral care and service in society. The \"Guides\" are designed especially for those engaged in Christian pastoral ministry, whether as ordained ministers or lay leaders in the congregation, but it is hoped that they will also be of help to other church members who are willing to invest time and serious thought in reading them. Covering areas of biblical study, Christian doctrine, and spirituality, the \"Guides\" relate their subject to current affairs, the arts, science, and a Christian life-style for the present age.",
