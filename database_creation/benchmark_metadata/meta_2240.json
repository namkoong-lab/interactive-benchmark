        "A bitterly cold March morning in Helsinki, and a young woman is found dead in Sibelius Park. A serial killer has made his first move.Miranda, a Detective Inspector in the Helsinki Homicide Unit struggles with a conundrum: Why are musicians being especially targeted?

And why does the killer appear to associate each of his attacks with one of the symphonies of the great Finnish composer, Jean Sibelius.Set against a backdrop of the Finnish music world, the story unfolds as a disturbing exploration of sexual obsession and the more sinister aspects of human sexuality.Almost as a parallel plot (in a series of lectures held at the Sibelius Academy) the reader is presented with a fascinating biographical sketch of Finland's greatest artist and an analysis of his orchestral masterpieces. These two plot threads will, in subtle ways, become entangled.For lovers of the detective story: intriguing twists and turns that culminate in a compelling, suspenseful denouement. For detective story aficionados who also love the music of Sibelius: this is compulsory reading!"

        "Review",
        "Boswell rationally blends detective story, psychological thriller and moral tale. The music and the murder plot interconnect surprisingly well. --",
        "Helsingin Sanomat [Finland’s leading national daily] January 3, 2005",
        "Boswell weaves a clever murder mystery. He writes fluidly, and enjoyably colours his language with expressions beyond the everyday. --",
        "Turun Sanomat [Finland’s third largest daily] November 11, 2004",
        "Does the plot flow and intensify? Are clues hidden between the lines? Is the reader rewarded? Yes, yes and yes! --",

        "From the Author",
        "My original inspiration for writing this book was to combine two things that I love: the jigsaw-puzzle intricacies of the detective story and the creative grandeur of Sibelius's music. The concept of presenting fiction and non-fiction within the same volume is by no means new, but many would question the wisdom of incorporating a series of lectures on Jean Sibelius's life and music into an otherwise mainstream crime thriller. Of the dozen and a half people who generously read my draught manuscript two years ago, some complained that the lectures interfered with the plot line because what they most wanted was to find out whether Miranda would manage to catch the killer before he struck again or whether she would finally get together with Adrian; others insisted that the Sibelius lectures were an important and integral part of the reading experience and must on no account be omitted.",
        "After reviewing this contradictory but valuable feedback from my reader guinea pigs, I decided to attempt a compromise. The lectures remain, but certain sections have been bracketed off as optional. The individual reader must judge whether this approach has been a success or failure.",
        "Looking back, I see that one of the greatest challenges I set myself in the novel was the placing of a woman in the key role. For any man, understanding the workings of the female mind and the complexities of feminine emotional and sexual feelings is a notoriously difficult task. To my relief, most women readers have taken my character, DI Miranda Lewis, seriously and have even been able to identify with her to a certain extent. Nevertheless, I have to say that, for me — as I suspect for most of my fellow men — unravelling the mysteries of the female mind will remain a lifelong task.",
