        "Designed with wet, windy winter conditions in mind, the waterproof, windproof Gordini Women's Polar mittens will always keeps you dry and comfortable. Water-resistant 700-fill DownTek insulation provides warmth while a stretchy shell with genuine deerskin accents and grippy palms ensure dexterity in the cold. DownTek Water Repellent Down is down that has been treated with water-repellent-nano-treatment. A proprietary application method instead of a bath treatment is used, thereby eliminating waste run-off. Gordini supports the Responsible Down Standard in our use of down. These insulated mittens are made waterproof with AquaBloc, Gordini's proprietary waterproof, breathable, windproof technology. Exclusively engineered for hand wear, AquaBloc is an insert technology that allows moisture accumulated from within the glove to escape and provide for breathability and enhanced warmth and comfort. The best way to clean and dry Gordini gloves and mittens: wipe clean with a damp cloth and mild soapy solution if needed, and then hang-dry away from a direct heat source. Do not machine dry or dry clean Gordini gloves or mittens."
