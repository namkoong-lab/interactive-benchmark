        "The GZL Classic Grizzly Clog from Haflinger is a beautiful and thoughtfully designed casual shoe made for everyday comfort. It has many features to promote the health and proper alignment of your feet. This clog has a contoured heel seat, a wool-felt inside lining for moisture absorption, a cork-latex footbed with arch support, a rocker heel, and a roomy toe box with a toe bar. The outsole is non-skid for greater stability indoors and out. Not to be forgotten is the 100-percent wool felt upper which keeps you feet at an ideal temperature in warm or cold weather.",
        "Founded 50 years ago as a family-owned business, Haflinger is the largest manufacturer of boiled wool in Germany. Run by the grandson of the founder, Haflinger is known in many international markets for not only its boiled wool slippers and wool felt clogs, but more importantly for its outstanding quality and workmanship. In 1991 Gerda Hoehm began importing Haflinger into the U.S. and Canada and the company has since doubled and tripled sales from year to year--our footwear has been extremely well received in North America. Although the recipe for reliable footwear and superior wool has not changed since the early days of Haflinger, the line has evolved its product offering to include a range of styles--children's slippers and clogs, wool-felt cork-bottom clogs, hard- and soft-sole slippers, and our newest sandal and clog line, the Trend Collection. Whether you prefer the classic Grizzly clog, our breathable, comfortable boiled-wool slippers, or our fresh, new Trend styles, Haflinger footwear consistently treats your feet to the best!",
