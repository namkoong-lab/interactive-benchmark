        "The Bosch metric tap and die set features a wide range of taps (including Plug taps), dies and assorted wrenches and accessories. Plug taps are ideal for cutting right-hand internal threads; they are the most widely used type of tap, with three to five threads chamfered for general-purpose applications. Dies cut right-hand external threads. They are commonly used for threading rods, bolts, and studs. Made from heat-treated carbon steel, these are rust- and tarnish-resistant tools. The rolled threads are more accurate and cleaner than machined threads. They are tooled to the most exacting specifications to ensure that bolts anchor securely. Laser-etched marking ensures size identification and won't wear off."
