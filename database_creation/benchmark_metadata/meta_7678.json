        "A fun, family space adventure just for kids, but with all the retro-silly banter adults will love. Matt Mercury, Plot of the Galactic Mastermind is the novelization of an innovative new feature film that recalls all the colorful fun we remember from space-operas of the 1960s and 1970s. In the future, the way it used to be a heroic star-pilot Matt Mercury must take an untried starship on a break-neck race across the galaxy to save the Earth and capture an evil, mutant, super-genius. This exciting space adventure features blue-haired cuties, Rocket-aces, robotic-beans, inarticulate cyclopes, speaking apes and Matt's very own half house-cat girlfriend. Will Matt return the Earth to its orbit or will the galaxy forever be controlled by the Mastermind? Illustrated by the author and includes 16 exclusive photos from the film!"
