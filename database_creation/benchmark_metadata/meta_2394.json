        "\"beautifully encapsulates what love is\"",
        "Kirkus Reviews",
        "After ten years together, including some difficult times, Adam and Eva are still as in love as they were when they told each other every day that they loved each other every day more.All-round adorable Adam - adopted, mixed-race, with a deep social conscience that he shares with his wife - claims to have no issues other than having no issues. Raised by remarkable parents, he has grown up happy and grounded, uninterested in his \"other parents\" or in why they might have had to give him up.Having lost her father at fifteen, and still suffering a terrible relationship with \"mother\", Eva has more issues than she cares to admit, and it falls to an unexpected visit by two policemen to uncover a secret she has kept from her husband since the first day they met.With the past at last explained, and the worst of it now apparently behind them, today has been a day of good news, which Eva is looking forward to sharing with the friends who have invited them to dinner. But their hosts seem to have very different plans for the evening, and the air is thick with tension as gradually the reason for their invitation begins to come out...Its satirical humor sometimes black and irreverent, POLK, HARPER & WHO is a contemporary tale of complex family relationships, of lifelong friendships being put to the test, and ultimately of the triumph of imperfect London love within imperfect London lives.Contains Mature Themes",

        "\"To read a novel by Panayotis Cacoyannis is to delve deeply into the psyches of always complex, and often unusual characters...As with other Cacoyannis novels, the language, the cleverness, the juxtaposition of heartbreak and humor and the presence of truly hilariously drawn characters is at least half the pleasure of reading the book... The attention to detail and the complexity of  his descriptions of both character and setting are captivating.\"",
        "Casey Dorman - Lost Coast Review",
        "\"In this literary novel, family secrets, friendship, and the resilience of love play out in a dinner party between two couples...At a dinner party with Karen and her husband, Jean-Claude, several truths surface, including an important secret Eva has been keeping. But Adam doesn't focus on the injury to him; rather, he sees the secret as something \"she had borne heavily... from now on Adam wanted her to know that he was bearing it with her - with, not against her,\" a sentence that beautifully encapsulates what love is...The book's seriousness is relieved, complicated, and strengthened by its trenchant observations of horrible people, along with black humor involving Eva's dead relative, a rare 1970s biscuit tin, and the wooden sculpture of a bleeding vagina.A thoughtful, observant, and often humorous tale about real connections.\"",

        "\"Another home run from the versatile pen of the author whose name I cannot pronounce, but can remember... He definitely holds a secure place in my Top Ten Authors List...Although said to be a love story, I found it to be more about the wife, who had a strange childhood... The husband absolutely adored his wife, and this is what I absolutely adore about this male author - that he writes so tenderly about a guy's feelings, and makes the guy still love the wife long after I would have taken her by the shoulders and shaken her until her eyeballs rattled...Good book. I'm having trouble expressing why I liked it so much, but I really did.\"",

After two years as an army conscript (at a time when the island suffered first a military coup and then an invasion), he traveled to Britain where he studied law at Oxford and qualified to practice at the Bar. Having then decided that he didn't want to be a lawyer, he also graduated art school, and for many happy years he worked as a painter and sculptor, until a spell of artist's block led to a very short course in creative writing...\", 'www.panayotiscacoyannis.com', 'His time now exclusively devoted to writing, THE DEAD OF AUGUST was his first novel, a contemporary satire set in London, where he lives. His own experiences while working in the city as an artist, together with the colorful relationships of many of his friends, provided Panayotis with a wealth of material to draw on. Surprisingly all his friends are still talking to him, and none of them are planning to sue him. As well as receiving a starred Kirkus review, THE DEAD OF AUGUST was named to Kirkus Reviews\\' \"Best Books of 2015\".', 'Also set in modern-day London, BOWL OF FRUIT (1907) tells the story of a man with a fantastical talent, and of his epic, twenty-four hour journey with a beautiful ghost-writer who knows more about his past than he does. IndieReader named Bowl of Fruit (1907) one of its \"Best Indie Books of 2015\", calling it \"a magically original story\" and \"an incredible read\".', '“Relieved, complicated, and strengthened by its trenchant observations of horrible people, along with black humor...” (Kirkus Reviews), POLK, HARPER & WHO is a contemporary story of complicated friendships and family relationships, and ultimately of the triumph of imperfect London love within imperfect London lives.', 'London 1969. While men are walking on the moon, a series of dramatic events threaten to have lasting repercussions for Jane and the people she loves... In another starred review, and naming it one of their \"Indie Best Books of the Month\" for June 2018, and then one of their \"Best Books of 2018\", Kirkus Reviews have acclaimed THE MADNESS OF GRIEF as a \"richly complicated, and deeply engaging coming-of-age tale.\" Lightened by a touch of Panayotis\\' familiar dark humor, \"the story moves rapidly, contains a genuine mystery, and is thoroughly entertaining.\" Casey Dorman - Lost Coast Review', 'Psychological, Magical, Mad, Panayotis\\' fifth book is another London story of a journey on a long winding road and beyond. Describing the writing as \"intentionally disorienting and unnervingly addictive\", Kirkus Reviews judged FINGER OF AN ANGEL an \"exceptional novel\". It was also a Finalist in the 2019 Independent Author Network Book of the Year Awards.', 'With the dreadful 2020 drawing to a close, Panayotis finished his sixth novel, hoping its satirical foretelling of the future will not come to pass... London 2030. When a postman knocks on his door, the news he delivers will cause 70-year-old Anthony Pablo Rubens to reflect on all the sadnesses and joys of the past, while he begins to prepare for the surprises of the future. The present is a Kafkaesque “nightmare worse than 1984, a hideous world where people don’t need to be watched by Big Brother.” A dystopian political satire, THE COLDNESS OF OBJECTS is also a story of loss, and of different kinds of love. Also naming it as one of their \"Best Books of 2021\", in another starred review Kirkus Reviews have described it as \"a thoroughly gripping novel\" and an \"intriguing, timely, and terrifying portent of life after Covid-19.\" I', 'For his seventh novel, released in February 2023, Panayotis has returned to a lighter mood, a much-needed shift after the events of recent years. A satirical take on the multiplying ways in which art and the media, and even we ourselves in our daily interactions, are constantly blurring the line between fiction and fact, REIMAGINING BEN is also a tongue-in-cheek celebration of the trials and tribulations, triumphs and occasional absurdities, of our complex modern-day relationships and imperfect modern-day lives. In what Kirkus Reviews have described as a “lightly absurdist comedy”, \"a book of big, farcically dramatic moments\" and a “humorous and entertaining character study of two brothers besieged by the preposterous\", 33-year-old Jay embarks on a short, sharp journey of belated self-discovery, while constantly being goaded and taunted by his gay twin brother George.', \"Aside from reading, writing and playing with his cat, Panayotis' favorite pastime is going to the movies, and ever since his friend/therapist/barber recommended The Sopranos, he has also discovered good TV. He travels to Cyprus often, to visit friends and family and be near the sea.\", 'If anyone would like to get in touch with him, or get regular updates, including news about discounts and giveaways, a newsletter subscription form and a contact email address can be found on his website: www.panayotiscacoyannis.com']}"
