        "Power Stop Z23 Evolution Sport Brake Upgrade Kit makes it simple to increase the braking power of your daily-driver. This Power Stop kit is engineered to provide a low dust & noise-free upgrade over your stock brake system. The Power Stop Z23 brake upgrade kit makes it simple to complete your brake job by including everything you need: perfectly matched drilled & slotted rotors, Z23 Evolution Sport carbon-fiber ceramic brake pads, upgraded hardware, and high performance lubricant. The low-dust ceramic formula brake pads are reinforced with carbon fibers to strengthen the compound. They are dust free, noise-free, and give you increased braking power without sacrificing everyday drivability. The rotors are cast using the finest G3000 metallurgy with strict OE tolerances - making them a perfect, bolt-on upgrade without the need to make any modifications. Precision drill holes allow for maximum rotor cooling. This keeps your brakes temperatures down during extreme operating conditions. Rounded slots help wipe away any gas or debris - keeping a clear contact patch on the rotor surface for safe, smooth braking. Silver Zinc Dichromate plating is applied to all drilled & slotted rotors, they not only look great behind your wheels, but to help prevent rust & corrosion. Get your Power Stop’s Z23 Evolution Sport brake kit and enjoy better, noise-free braking without that nasty brake dust!"
