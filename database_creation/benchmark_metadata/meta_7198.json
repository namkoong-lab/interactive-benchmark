        "Hank the Snake is taking his new toy truck out for a ride. What could possibly go wrong? As it turns out, almost everything. Using short rhymes and colorful illustrations, Hank’s New Truck chronicles a day in the life of an optimistic young snake who shows the importance of holding onto hope, even when things seem most hopeless. To help turn hope into survival, the author is donating all of the proceeds from book sales to Seattle Children's Hospital. Those donations will then be matched, dollar-for-dollar, up to $15,000.
