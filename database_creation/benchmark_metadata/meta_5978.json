        "FOLDING Custom-fit Windshield Sunshade - This Ultimate Folding Sunshade has a silver reflector film outside and graphite protective felt on the inside.",
        "Comes with a convenient storage bag ~ Dual-purpose sunshade that cools during the summer and captures heat during the winter by reversing it",
        "Picture is for demonstration purposes only and may not depict your exact make/model/year, but all the materials used are the same for each custom-fit folding sunshade",
        "Please note that because this fold-up sunshade is made from an unbendable material, it does not afford the complete windshield coverage as do our rollup models and thus are cut slightly shorter at the top perimeter and around the rearview mirror/sensor area. The Ultimate Reflector is manufactured using a superior quality multi-layered material with a reflective mylar heat barrier that reflects harmful UV rays.",
