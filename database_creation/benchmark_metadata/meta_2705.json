        "Today the host of ORA TV’s Newsbreaker, and now calling Larry King her boss, Melissa McCarty worked her way up through the trenches of live television news. But she was also running away from her past, one of growing up in the roughest of neighborhoods, watching so many she knew—including her brother—succumb to drugs, gangs, and violence. It was a past that forced her to be tough and streetwise, traits that in her career as a popular television newscaster, would end up working against her.Every tragic story she covered was a grim reminder of where she’d been. But the practiced and restrained emotion given to the camera became her protective armor even in her private life where she was unable to let her guard down—a demeanor that damaged both her personal and professional relationships. In News Girls Don’t Cry, McCarty confronts the memory-demons of her past, exploring how they hardened her—and how she turned it all around. An inspiring story of overcoming adversity, welcoming second chances, and becoming authentic."

        "News Girls Don't Cry is an unflinching peek behind the tough exterior of a celebrated newswoman, one that places McCarty among the top tier of journalistic memoirists. McCarty, whose book is part-memoir and partly a call for an infusion of humanity in the televised news biz, is not (yet) a household name, but her book makes a great case that perhaps she should be. - Monsters and CriticsNews Girls Don't Cry is a remarkable saga. Open this book thinking \"oh, those newsgirls are all just Suzy Creamcheese: clueless ex-cheerleaders who smile and read a teleprompter.\" Do that, and be transformed a harrowing journey of pain, survival and triumph that is the journey of Melissa McCarty. I could not put it down or look away. - James Dalessandro Author; 1906 and Citizen JaneShe's a terrific storyteller, and she dishes some doozies about her demons and her personal life. - Norm Clarke 'The Las Vegas Review-Journal' columnistA battle between personal success and private anguish, a captivating brave tale of a woman's drive to success and tireless struggle to keep her family intact...an honest account of the common battle of addiction. --Susan Hendricks, CNN Headline News anchorLisa Guerrero, Inside Edition Investigative Reporter \"This book is a sweet tribute to a sister's love for her troubled brother.\"",
