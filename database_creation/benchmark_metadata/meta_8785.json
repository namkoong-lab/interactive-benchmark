        "Advanced Linux Programming is divided into two parts. The first covers generic UNIX system services, but with a particular eye towards Linux specific information. This portion of the book will be of use even to advanced programmers who have worked with other Linux systems since it will cover Linux specific details and differences. For programmers without UNIX experience, it will be even more valuable. The second section covers material that is entirely Linux specific. These are truly advanced topics, and are the techniques that the gurus use to build great applications. While this book will focus mostly on the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the Linux kernel and the C library, a preliminary introduction to the development tools available will allow all who purchase the book to make immediate use of Linux."

        "From the Publisher",
        "Mark Mitchell, Alex Samuel, and Jeffrey Oldham are definitely some of the most talented authors I've had the pleasure of working with. Once you take a look at this book you'll see what I mean. This pre-published review of the book says it all: \"As Linux becomes a more mainstream player in the internet infrastructure market, there is a tremendous need for lucid programming texts that also convey some of the philosophy behind the Linux and GNU movements. This book does an incredible job of covering all of that. I think it will be a standard against which other programming texts for Linux (and with all due respect to Richard Stevens, possibly UNIX as well) are measured.\"",

        "From the Author",
        "Back when we first started programming for the GNU/Linux environment, we had to learn it the hard way - by browsing man pages, online documentation, and the Linux source code looking for features we needed. We wished for a book that provided a road map of Linux's capabilities and quirks that manifest themselves in real-world programs. Now that we know our way around, we've written that book to help the next generation of GNU/Linux programmers learn the advanced features and techniques that are most often employed by professional developers for this platform.",
