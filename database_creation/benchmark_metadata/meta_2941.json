        "From a USA TODAY Bestselling author, the first book in the acclaimed Ginger Gold Mystery series.",
        "Murder’s a pain in the bow!",
        "It's 1923 and war widow fashionista Ginger Gold (a former British Secret Service Agent) makes a cross-Atlantic journey from Boston to London, England with her lovable Boston terrier and good friend, Nurse Higgins. When the ship's captain is found dead in a most intriguing fashion, Ginger is only too happy to lend her assistance to the handsome Chief Inspector Basil Reed. Wearing her Italian T-strap shoes and pretty cloche hat she must outwit the killer before she finds herself in a deadly pickle!",
        "This fun, jazz-age whodunit has readers saying \"Lady Gold is a charming heroine\" and \"can't stop reading!\"",
        "Get started and download the first book in this binge-worthy series today.",
        "★★★★★",
        "Researching for the Ginger Gold Mysteries has been so much fun. I hope you sense that as you read. Ginger Gold is smart, savvy, and delightful. The fashions, the dances, the CRIME. The character of Haley Higgins, a medical student at the London Medical School for Women allows me to further delve into another keen interest of mine: forensics. Never fear, the Ginger Gold Mysteries are COZY, so no scary, graphic on-stage violence. You'll find these books to be clean reads, with no swearing or sex.
