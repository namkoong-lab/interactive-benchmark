        "Wade Dalton is having a bad day: his five-year-old has accidentally set the kitchen on fire. His daughter is surly, as usual. The baby hasn't been fed yet. And his mother—aka \"the childminder\"—has eloped with a scam artist. Could it get any worse? Turns out it can, when the annoyingly beautiful daughter of said scam artist shows up at the door, batting her doe eyes at Wade and offering to be his temporary nanny until the newlyweds' return. Could he trust her to be under his roof? Could he trust himself with her under his roof?Originally published in 2006"
