        "About the Author",
        "Myrna J. de la Paz was born in Manila, and grew up in a town where indigenous culture and spiritual beliefs are practiced parallel with Christianity. She later shared this world of magic and myth when she wrote and directed \"Bakunawa,\" a play based on the Bagobo people. She now lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two children. <P>Youshan Tang's artistic promise began to show when he was a child in Shanghai, China. He graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Peking University with degrees in Chinese art and literature. Since 1980, Tang has made his home in San Francisco where the cultural diversity inspires his work. This is the third book that he has illustrated for Shen's."
