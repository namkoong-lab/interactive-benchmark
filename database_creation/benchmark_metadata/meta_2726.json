        "I know this sounds weird, but I can read lips. Of course, you'reprobably thinking, why would a cat want to read lips? A fair questionand the answer is I don't. The fact is, I can't hear so great. Ican read minds though; how's that for a wing-dinger? Yep, I'mtelepathic, so really the hearing impediment thing isn't much of aproblem, and well, actually I tend to only read lips if I'mpreoccupied. Guess who was preoccupied?I was all curled up onthe Lazyboy under the big palm watching my favorite show on the boobtube. Lily was on the phone, imagine that, and things were getting alittle nutty for Batman and the Boy Wonder.It seems Batmanand the Boy Wonder were just about to be sawn in half when I happenedto glance up to see Lily say that she needed a CAT Scan. At first, Ithought she said 'cat scam'; I mean, who would she need me toscam? I'm not that kind of cat anyway, how dare she even insinuatesuch a thing. But then she said it again.\"Yes, I'm sure,Holly, a CAT Scan!\"Holy scantonese noodles, Batman, whatthe hell do you think I need to be scanned for? I've got all myshots. I've been de-wormed twice this year, and this is the fourthtime I have made my claws grow back.I can make my claws growback. I have serious mental powers, plus I read a book by ErnestHolmes called",
        "The Science of the Mind",
        ", which gave me somegreat ideas like growing my claws back. I'd recommend it toOprah.I hopped off the Lazyboy and went into the kitchen andcircled around Lily's legs, but Lily just kept blabbing away aboutscanning me. I glanced at the TV where a giant maniacal saw waswhirling steadily toward the dynamic duo. It was too much; I couldn'tconcentrate; CAT Scan overload--so I beat it out of there.Isprinted out into the cool night air, glad to be away from even theidea of a scanning. I was hungry, as usual, which meant I needed aSan Francisco treat, and let me tell you, I wasn't thinking aboutRice a Roni. I licked my soon to be grubby little paws and made myway down the north-face fire escape.I live in an area thatmany years ago housed dockworkers and fisherman. The area is calledTelegraph Hill, and there are a lot of cats in the neighborhood.Thebuilding I live in is called",

        "The Old Brown",
        "ourselves. It took us about twelve years. Holly lives up top and Lilylives bottom side.I was thinking that it's always nice toget out of the house when I came to The Greenwich Stairs. I lookedaround really good; the coast seemed clear but, just in case, I shotdown 'em like a rocket.The stairs are The Greenwich StreetStairs, and they're famous. About three months ago, some ass-lipkicked me down them and my ribs still hurt from the tumble. Humansare often cruel. Anyway, I don't want to think about that. I wantto think about Batman."
