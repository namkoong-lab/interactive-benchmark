        "About the Author",
        "Born in a small town in Missouri in 1920, Ralph Burbridge was just a boy when he answered the call of his country to go to war. He was present in one of the most publicized events of World War II. Upon returning home, he started a family, and lived his life, working for several charities and the Veterans Administration during his career before retiring to make beer, wine, and live in Washington with his wife."
