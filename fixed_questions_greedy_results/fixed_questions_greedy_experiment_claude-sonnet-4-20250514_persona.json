        "What is your primary intended use for a washer and dryer - are you looking for a compact unit for a small apartment or RV, a standard capacity unit for a typical household of 2-4 people, or a large capacity unit for a big family or heavy laundry loads?",
        "What's your budget range for a combination washer and dryer unit?",

        "Do you have any brand preferences for combination washer and dryer units, such as LG, Samsung, Whirlpool, or GE, or are you open to any brand as long as it meets your energy efficiency and capacity requirements?",
        "Do you have any specific installation requirements or preferences - do you need a ventless unit that doesn't require external venting, a vented unit that connects to existing ductwork, or are you flexible on ventilation requirements as long as the unit is energy efficient?",
        "What is your preferred wash and dry cycle time - do you prioritize faster cycles that complete in under 2 hours for convenience, standard cycles that take 3-4 hours but provide thorough cleaning and drying, or are you flexible on cycle time as long as the unit maximizes energy and water efficiency?",

        "What is your primary interest in classical music - are you looking for piano sonatinas and solo piano works, orchestral pieces and symphonies, or are you actually more interested in music-related items like guitar accessories or songwriting tools that might better match your musical interests?",
        "What's your budget range for classical sonatinas or songwriting tools?",
        "Since you're interested in songwriting tools but the available products are classical sonatinas priced under $0.10 (far below your $100-200 budget), would you prefer to select multiple products to potentially find sheet music or educational materials that could inspire your songwriting, or would you rather focus on finding the single best option that might contain classical compositions you could adapt or draw inspiration from for your own music?",
        "What specific aspects of classical compositions are most valuable for your songwriting inspiration - are you looking for melodic patterns and chord progressions you can study and adapt, rhythmic structures and time signatures to incorporate into your own music, or harmonic arrangements and voice leading techniques that could enhance your compositional skills?",
        "Since you're focused on harmonic arrangements and voice leading techniques for songwriting inspiration, do you prefer classical sonatinas that feature complex harmonic progressions with frequent modulations and sophisticated voice leading, or simpler harmonic structures that clearly demonstrate fundamental voice leading principles that would be easier to analyze and adapt to your own compositions?",
        "Since you're looking for classical sonatinas with simple harmonic structures to study voice leading principles, do you prefer works that focus on traditional major and minor key relationships with clear tonic-dominant progressions, or are you interested in pieces that incorporate modal harmonies or chromatic voice leading that might offer more diverse songwriting inspiration?",
        "Since you're interested in modal harmonies and chromatic voice leading for songwriting inspiration, do you prefer classical sonatinas from the Baroque or Classical periods that demonstrate clear voice leading principles through counterpoint and figured bass techniques, or are you more interested in Romantic or early 20th century sonatinas that incorporate more adventurous harmonic language and chromatic voice leading that might translate better to modern songwriting styles?",
        "Since you're interested in Romantic or early 20th century sonatinas with adventurous harmonic language, do you prefer pieces that emphasize chromatic voice leading through inner voice movement and counterpoint that would help with multi-instrumental songwriting arrangements, or pieces that focus on harmonic color and extended chords that would be more useful for developing richer chord progressions in your songs?",
        "Since you're looking for Romantic or early 20th century sonatinas with harmonic color and extended chords for songwriting inspiration, do you prefer pieces that feature impressionistic harmonies with added tone clusters and quartal harmonies that could inspire modern ambient or indie songwriting styles, or pieces with more traditional extended chords like 7ths, 9ths, and 13ths that would be more applicable to jazz-influenced or pop songwriting?",
        "Since you're looking for Romantic or early 20th century sonatinas with traditional extended chords like 7ths, 9ths, and 13ths for songwriting inspiration, and all available products are priced extremely low without descriptions, would you prefer to select the highest-priced option available (Product ID 4 at $0.08) as it might indicate better quality content, or would you prefer one of the free options (Products 2, 12, 18, 23, 24, 26, or 30 at $0.00) to minimize cost while still getting harmonic study material?"
